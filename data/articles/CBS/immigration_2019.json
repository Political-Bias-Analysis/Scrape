            "article_content": "The first Democratic presidential debate became bilingual in its first few minutes \u2014 and by the end, three of the 2020 contenders had shown off their Spanish skills. Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas was the first candidate to break into Spanish at the debate in Miami, which has one of the largest Spanish-speaking populations of any American city. O'Rourke, a fluent Spanish speaker, switched languages while responding to his first question of the night, about whether he would support a 70% top tax rate. O'Rourke did not directly answer the question, in either English or Spanish. But after beginning his response in English, he said in Spanish, \"We need to include each person in the success of this economy. But if we want to do that, we need to include each person in our democracy.\" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker's stunned look when O'Rourke suddenly switched languages became one of the first memes of the debate. O'Rourke later spoke Spanish again in a discussion about immigration.\u00a0 Booker, another fluent Spanish speaker, had his chance later on. When asked what he would do on the first day of his presidency, Booker replied in Spanish, \"The situation right now is unacceptable. This president has attacked, has demonized immigrants.\" He switched to English to say that on his first day in the Oval Office, he would end immigration and borders policies \"that are violating the human rights.\" Former Obama Housing Secretary Julian Castro was the final Democratic contender to speak both languages. He began his closing statement in Spanish, saying, \"my name is Juli\u00e1n Castro and I'm running for president of the United States,\" before finishing in English. Castro has admitted that he is not a fluent Spanish speaker, despite being the only Latino candidate in the race. One of the debate moderators, Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart, also spoke Spanish when asking a question to O'Rourke. O'Rourke frequently breaks out into Spanish on the campaign trail.\u00a0 By the end of the night, some Democratic contenders who will be in Thursday's debate felt compelled to admit that their Spanish skills aren't so impressive. \"I need to learn Spanish by tomorrow night at 9,\" author Marianne Williamson wrote on Twitter.\u00a0 \"My Spanish is terrible,\" entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted. \"Sorry Ms. Trovato my 9th grade Spanish teacher - not your fault.\" The Hispanic vote will be crucial in the 2020 race, and a recent Pew Research Center study said that Hispanics would likely be the largest minority voting group in the next election.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Washington, D.C. \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday announced it had reached an asylum agreement with Honduras' scandal-plagued government, unveiling the latest of its controversial immigration deals with the three countries in Central America's Northern Triangle, where the bulk of U.S.-bound migrants are currently coming from or transiting through. Under the tenure of Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, the Department of Homeland Security has spearheaded a campaign of diplomacy to broker bilateral accords with several Latin American countries designed to deter migrants considering journeying to the U.S.-Mexico border.\u00a0 The agreement with Honduras' center-right government will allow the U.S. to deport asylum seekers who seek refuge at the southern border if they traveled through Honduras and failed to seek protection there, according to a senior Homeland Security official. The U.S., the official added, would send these migrants to Honduras so they can have the \"opportunity\" to seek asylum or another form of protection there.\u00a0 \"It will allow migrants to seek protection as close to home as possible,\" the Homeland Security official said during a call with reporters.\u00a0 \u00a0 According to the official, the accord would apply to migrants who seek asylum or protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT) \u2014 a lesser form of humanitarian relief \u2014 in the U.S. The deal means the U.S. will have the power to potentially deport thousands of asylum seekers from all corners of the globe to Honduras, a country that like Guatemala and El Salvador, has seen a lot of its citizens journey north because of the poverty and violence rampant in many areas. Most of the migrant families and unaccompanied children who have headed to the U.S.-Mexico border in unprecedented numbers in recent months have hailed from these three countries, collectively known as the Northern Triangle \u2014 a region that has long suffered from deeply-rooted economic inequality and political instability.\u00a0 In practice, those likely to be affected by the implementation of Wednesday's agreement will be migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Brazil, Venezuela and African nations that have journeyed to the U.S.-Mexico border in larger numbers in the past year.\u00a0 The Homeland Security official said the deal committed the U.S. to help the government of Honduras bolster its asylum system \u2014 a similar pledge made to leaders in Guatemala and El Salvador.\u00a0 The agreement, signed on the sidelines of the annual United Nations General Assembly, follows months of discussions with the government of President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, a staunch international ally of the Trump administration who has been dogged by accusations of corruption.  Solving the crisis at the border means working with our neighbors in the region. Honduras has been a great partner. Today we signed a bilateral agreement to build stronger asylum capabilities in the Northern Triangle and further enhance asylum and protection capacity in Honduras. pic.twitter.com/8I37iEu97r After being re-elected in 2017 in a very close election denounced as fraudulent by some, Hern\u00e1ndez has faced several corruption allegations and members of his family have been accused of harboring drug traffickers. He himself was named by the Justice Department last month as an unindicted co-conspirator in a drug conspiracy and money laundering case against his brother.\u00a0 Asked if Hern\u00e1ndez's implication in a drug conspiracy case was considered in negotiations, the Homeland Security official declined to comment, referring the matter to the Justice Department instead. \u00a0 Last week, the administration touted a similar deal with El Salvador, a small country that has long been plagued by widespread insecurity and gang violence. Earlier in the summer, the U.S. and the Guatemalan government brokered an agreement to allow the Trump administration to deport asylum seekers who traveled from other countries through Guatemala to reach the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 and these migrants would be required to seek asylum in Guatemala instead.\u00a0 Like the agreements with Guatemala and El Salvador, the deal announced on Wednesday with Honduras has not been implemented. The Homeland Security official said all countries involved are proceeding to fulfill the respective domestic legal obligations to ratify the accords.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Responding to concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers, Congress' independent watchdog will launch an investigation into the administration's intensifying efforts to seize private land to build barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border and fulfill one of President Trump's signature campaign pledges. The Government Accountability Office notified Democratic leadership in the Senate that it will review the Trump administration's attempts to take over private property near the southern border through eminent domain, a power the government has to expropriate land for public use as long as the landowners are compensated. Many landowners oppose these efforts and are taking the administration to court in a bid to keep their property. In its notification to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, dated September 5 and obtained by CBS News, the Government Accountability Office said the matter was within its purview to investigate. The office said it would consult with the Department Homeland Security's inspector general to make sure it is not duplicating investigations. Democrats, who have long opposed Mr. Trump's efforts to build a border wall, praised the move. \"Make no mistake: this administration is trying to take away Americans' private property without an ounce of oversight and has repeatedly failed to provide basic, critical information, including how many citizens will have their land seized,\" Schumer wrote in a statement Wednesday. Frustrated with the scant information from the administration on its use of eminent domain, Schumer and fellow Democratic Senators Dick Durbin, Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich had asked the Government Accountability Office last month to initiate an inquiry. They asked the office to look into the number of citizens who could potentially have their land seized, the cost the property acquisitions, the time it will take and the administration's work to compensate landowners. Durbin applauded the investigation into what he called Mr. Trump's \"land grab,\" saying in a statement that private lands along the border belong to local residents, not to the federal government. Udall, who represents the border state of New Mexico, went further, calling on the administration to stop invoking eminent domain until the Government Accountability Office concludes its probe. \"Under this administration's thoughtless and potentially lawless land grab, homes could be confiscated, farms and livelihoods ruined, neighbors cut off from one another, Tribal sovereignty upended, and endangered species and habitat lost forever,\" Udall said in a statement. The federal watchdog's decision comes as the president rushes to deliver on his vow to build a wall to deter illegal border crossings, which have dropped in recent months since a 13-year monthly high in May. Mr. Trump has often embraced eminent domain, calling it \"necessary\" to bolster border security. With a little over a year left until the 2020 presidential election, the president has been urging officials to ramp up efforts to build new barriers or replace dilapidated ones in both public and private lands near the southern border as quickly as possible. Along with other promises to crackdown on illegal immigration, Mr. Trump's vow to erect a wall along the border with Mexico galvanized his supporters in 2016, and he's hoping construction will energize his base for his reelection.

Before departing Washington for a two-week vacation, President Trump on Friday said there was \"tremendous\" support for \"really common-sense sensible, important background checks\" and that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is \"totally on board.\" Lawmakers, including some Republicans, are calling on McConnell to call the Senate back from its August recess to vote on bipartisan gun violence prevention legislation that passed the House in February. McConnell on Thursday said that a measure expanding background checks to all gun purchasers would be \"front and center\" when the Senate comes back into session next month. Just hours before the president arrived in El Paso to visit first responders and shooting victims on Wednesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents apprehended over six hundred immigrant workers in targeted workplace raids in Mississippi. Officials touted the raids as \"the largest single state immigration enforcement operation in our nation's history.\" The conversation about mass shootings also hit the campaign trail, as gun policy activists quickly organized a presidential \"gun safety\" forum in Des Moines on Saturday, where more than 20 Democratic presidential candidates are gathering for the Iowa State Fair. According to the Des Moines Register, 17 candidates plan to attend and talk about their plans to address gun violence. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who founded the group \"Everytown for Gun Safety\" in 2014, will also speak at the event. \"The shootings in El Paso and Dayton have rightly outraged Americans, and we are going to make sure that gun safety is front and center in this presidential election \u2014 something that is long overdue,\" Bloomberg said ahead of the forum.

            "article_content": "Business was looking good for private prison companies soon after President Donald Trump took office in 2017. Within weeks of his inauguration, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions signed an order reversing an Obama-era\u00a0directive\u00a0to phase out private prison use.\u00a0 That caused shares of the two largest private prison companies \u2014 CoreCivic and GEO Group \u2014 to soar, with each reaching a post-election peak in April 2017. Since then, however, both companies have lost roughly half their stock market value amid mounting public and investor concerns, while at least eight banks have moved to distance themselves from the private prison business. Here's a look at what's behind that shift in the companies' fortunes. A year ago, executives from both companies touted a rising need from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to house a growing number of detainees. \"We've seen a steady increase in our ICE populations throughout the country, and we expect this trend to continue as ICE seeks additional capacity,\" said David Donahue, senior vice president of GEO's Corrections and Detention division, on an August 2018 call with Wall Street analysts. That same month, CoreCivic CEO Damon Damon Hininger told investors that more ICE contracts would \"contribute meaningfully to earnings growth to 2019.\" Their comments came as\u00a0reports\u00a0gained widespread attention about the mistreatment of migrants seeking entry to the U.S. at the Mexican border and children separated from their parents, as well as\u00a0squalid conditions. That prompted outrage from many quarters, including lawmakers and American citizens, and raised questions among some investors about the ethics of investing in private prisons. Both\u00a0Geo Group\u00a0and\u00a0CoreCivic\u00a0said they've been wrongly caught up in the backlash surrounding child separation and other controversies at the Mexican border. The companies have repeatedly said they don't manage centers that house unaccompanied immigrant minors or operate border patrol facilities. But for some investors, that distinction matters less and less. So far this year, at least eight banks have either said they will no longer lend to private company prison operators or are limiting their engagement with the industry. As a result, some investors are thinking twice about where to put their money. CalPERS, California's $356 billion pension fund, may need to reconsider an earlier decision to keep its money in the public prison companies, California Comptroller and CalPERS ex-officio board member Betty Yee\u00a0told\u00a0CIO Magazine last week. Investment in the private prison industry is getting riskier as banks withdraw, Yee told the magazine. \"As more information comes to light regarding the egregious conditions at U.S. border facilities, it elevates the larger issue of private prisons housing migrants,\" Yee said in an e-mailed comment through her office to CBS MoneyWatch. Public pressure is spurring action, too. More than 100 organizations known as the Families Belong Together Corporate Accountability Committee have\u00a0lobbied banks, companies and public officials to divest, Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, the executive director of MomsRising.org, told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. MomsRising.org, which focuses on creating family-friendly policies, has more than 1 million members. \"It's a unique moment where a wave of organizations are hearing from their members and that greater pressure is having an impact,\" Rowe-Finkbeiner said. \"So for our members, we're hearing that it's a priority to take the profit out of causing pain.\" Of the 14 banks identified by activists as extending credit or providing loans to Geo Group or CoreCivic, six have said they'll cease lending to the industry. Those six banks \u2014\u00a0Wells Fargo,\u00a0JP Morgan,\u00a0Bank of America,\u00a0SunTrust,\u00a0FifthThird\u00a0and\u00a0BNP Paribas\u00a0\u2014 together represent $1.93 billion, or 72%, of the financing that is estimated to be available to CoreCivic and Geo Group, based on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Most loans and credit lines under agreement stretch to at least 2023. Two additional banks told CBS MoneyWatch they have no plans to lend to the private prison industry in the future: Barclays and U.S. Bank. Both said their loans to the industry aren't material to overall finances, according to spokeswomen for the banks. PNC said its exposure \"is extremely small.\" PNC is \"committed to making thoughtful decisions that take into account the interests of all of our stakeholders,\" a spokeswoman said. Regions Bank declined to comment, saying policy makers and government officials \"are in the best position to address\" the issue, a spokeswoman told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. Citizens maintains \"a commitment of lending to companies that conduct their business in a socially responsible manner and if that is not the case we are prepared to exit the relationship,\" a spokesman said by telephone. Pinnacle Financial Partners isn't considering ending its loans to the industry, according to a spokesman. The bank generally lends to companies that \"have strong leadership teams, sound credit histories and good operating leverage,\" CEO Terry Turner said in an e-mailed statement.\u00a0 First Tennessee and Synovus banks both declined to comment. Still, some of the ICE contracts that prison company officials hoped to secure have indeed come to fruition. Since Mr. Trump took office, ICE has awarded more than $480 million in federal funds to GEO Group and more than $331 million to CoreCivic, Axios recently\u00a0reported, citing\u00a0USA Spending\u00a0figures. CoreCivic and Geo Group are for-profit prison companies organized as real estate investment trusts, known as REITS. Under the structure, 90% of the company's taxable income must be distributed to shareholders, and the REIT doesn't pay federal taxes on those gains. Both receive about half of their annual revenue from federal agencies, according to annual filings with the SEC. They also both count on ICE for providing at least $1 of every $5 in revenue.\u00a0 CoreCivic expects the banks to honor lending and credit agreements until their expiration in 2023, company spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. CoreCivic \"has meaningful cash flow in excess of dividends paid and the resources to fund day-to-day operations and pay off debt.\"\u00a0 Geo Group acknowledged in a recent SEC\u00a0filing\u00a0that \"increased public resistance to the use of public private partnerships\" may hurt its business. The bank divestment efforts are based on a \"false narrative\" that is a \"deliberate mischaracterization of our role as a long-standing government services provider\" that \"has been allowed to impact a decade-long banking relationship,\" Geo Group spokesman Pablo Paez said in an e-mailed statement. Geo Group's facilities provide \"humane residential care,\" he said. Some 2.3 million people are held in U.S. correctional facilities, including 109 federal and 1,719 state prisons, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a think tank. As many as 9% of U.S. prisons are run by private entities. Some senior officials at Bank of America were \"very upset about the broader issues of prison reform and sentencing reform\" and brought up the issue in meetings, urging the bank to \"make a statement,\" CEO Brian Moynihan recently told Fox News, according to a transcript. The bank ultimately decided to exit the industry.\u00a0 He added that the country needs \"to get immigration right.\"",

He cautioned his fellow Democrats to run the primary \"in a way that doesn't make us vulnerable to losing to Donald Trump.\" \"It's important that Democrats not disqualify ourselves running against Donald Trump, or make it easy for him to disqualify us,\" Bennet said. \"We lost to the guy once, we can't lose to him again.\" Bennet, who has represented Colorado in the Senate for a decade, is running as a moderate in the 2020 primary. He has taken particular aim at Bernie Sanders and the Medicare for All proposal backed my most of the Democratic contenders. He said it's critically important for Democrats to campaign for universal health care that builds on the Affordable Care Act and adds a public option. \"We want universal health care coverage. But\u00a0 we don't want a plan that takes away insurance.\" He also disagreed with his colleagues calling for the decriminalization of illegal border crossings. \"We should not be saying there is no criminal liability for coming across the border ilegally,\" he said. \"We shouldn't get rid of those criminal liabilities because every country in world [should have] a secure border.\"\u00a0 Bennet was a member of the bipartisan \"Gang of Eight\" that wrote a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013. It was not taken up by the House. Decriminalizing illegal immigration would hand Trump an opening on rhetoric, he said. \"Donald Trump is already saying Democrats are for open borders,\" he said, arguing that the president is the one \"turning our border into a symbol of anti immigrant hatred around the world.\" But Bennet insisted the party is not moving too far to the left, and that there was a difference between the party base and activists on social media. \"The day to day stuff on social media whatever it is one day...most of the base of the Democratic Party doesn't have time to follow that stuff...The base of the Democratic Party deeply wants to make sure Donald Trump is a one term president.\"\u00a0 Bennet appeared on the debate stage in Miami last month, but did not see a significant bump afterwards and hasn't gained much traction in the field. Still, he said, \"I think we're going to make it to the next debate...it's just one foot in front of the other.\"\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "In a landmark agreement to expand California's Medicaid program, state lawmakers struck a deal this week with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0to cover the health care costs\u00a0of an estimated 90,000 non-citizens living without legal permission in the Golden State.\u00a0 Their unprecedented move could also sway the 2020 debate over universal health care, as Democratic presidential candidates court votes\u00a0in the delegate-rich Super Tuesday state. \"Immigrants are an incredibly important part of our society and economy, and should be all fully included in our health system in this same way,\" Anthony Wright, executive director of the Health Access coalition in California, tells CBS News.\u00a0 \"This is a dramatically different direction to the Trump administration, to actually provide coverage further and get to the goal of an affordable, accountable, and universal health system,\" Wright added. Nearly every Democratic White House hopeful\u00a0has vowed\u00a0to seek some kind of universal health coverage, whether through \"Medicare for All,\" which would expand the health care system that covers older Americans to everyone, or other plans that build on the Affordable Care Act. Among them, few have staked out positions on whether their policies would cover all those living in the United States, regardless of their immigration status. During his last presidential bid in 2016, aides to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0told Politico\u00a0that his single-payer proposal encompassed \"everyone, including aspiring Americans.\"\u00a0 Reintroduced this year, the Vermont independent's Medicare-for-all bill\u00a0aims to do the same\u00a0by guaranteeing eligibility to \"every individual who is a resident of the United States.\" Five other Democratic presidential candidates -- Sens. Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren -- have all cosponsored the measure. \"We have to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all, including the undocumented,\" Sanders\u00a0declared to cheers\u00a0last month in Pasadena, at a presidential forum organized by immigrant rights groups. But senators who have supported Sanders' bill have rarely campaigned on how it would give people who are in the country illegally access to taxpayer-funded health care. \u00a0 Pressed last month on \"State of the Union\" to say whether her sponsorship of the bill meant she supported giving Medicare to those \"in this country illegally,\" Harris demurred. \"Let me just be very clear about this. I'm opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access to public safety, public education, or public health, period,\" the California Democrat\u00a0told CNN. Her answer swiftly prompted outrage from the right.\u00a0 \"It's completely unfair to the millions of Americans who do pay into the system,\" GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted\u00a0later that day\u00a0in response to Harris' quote.\u00a0 Asked in early May whether undocumented immigrants should have access to federal benefits, like Medicare and Medicaid, former Vice President Joe Biden sidestepped the question. \"Look, I think that anyone who is in a situation where they're in need of health care, regardless of whether they're documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they're cared for,\"\u00a0Biden said.\u00a0 Notwithstanding his parsing, President Trump's team quickly denounced the former vice president. \"So wrong, Sleepy Joe. We must take care of American citizens and our great seniors first,\"\u00a0the campaign retorted.\u00a0 Undocumented immigrants are explicitly\u00a0blocked\u00a0from the Affordable Care Act's marketplace, and extending taxpayer-funded coverage to them has long been a third rail in the American health care debate.\u00a0 In 2009, while a majority of Americans favored universal health care,\u00a080 percent opposed\u00a0providing health care to undocumented immigrants. That year, Republican Rep. Joe Wilson infamously shouted \"you lie\" during then-President Obama's State of the Union remarks, after Obama said his health care proposals\u00a0would not cover\u00a0illegal immigrants. Today an estimated 45 percent of undocumented, \"non-elderly\" immigrants\u00a0are uninsured. The Congressional Budget Office this year\u00a0estimated some 11 million\u00a0\"non-citizens who are not lawfully present\" could remain uninsured under a single-payer system, with half of them losing coverage altogether unless they are made eligible for the public plan.\u00a0 A handful of states\u00a0already cover\u00a0undocumented children and pregnant women, including California. And many local governments, Los Angeles County among them,\u00a0offer free health care\u00a0to low-income residents regardless of immigration status.\u00a0 Though California\u00a0is poised to be the first\u00a0to offer some low-income undocumented adults coverage statewide, eligibility would be capped at age 25.\u00a0 \"I think Republicans will make it an issue, but states are doing this and ultimately Medicaid, a lot of the time, it's up to states to do it,\" Jim Kessler, vice president of policy at Third Way, tells CBS News. \"I'm not saying this is going to be broadly popular if you do it. But on health care there are red lines that, if you cross it, you are in a danger zone with average voters. Expanding coverage of health care to some undocumented workers doesn't cross that red line, in my view,\" Kessler added. Though a far cry from the single-payer system endorsed by Sanders and others, Kessler said even his center-left think tank's\u00a0ownhttps://www.thirdway.org/report/cost-caps-and-coverage-for-all-how-to-make-health-care-universally-affordable\"cost\u00a0caps and coverage for all\" plan\u00a0also makes sure to address coverage for uninsured undocumented immigrants. \"I think what we're showing is whether a candidate is talking about Medicare for All like Governor Newsom does, or universal coverage in general, it's important to tie that to specific things we can do in year one,\" said Wright, of the Health Access coalition.\u00a0 \"There's no conflict between having a broad vision of what universal health care might look like, whether it's Medicare for All' or whatever else it might be, and at the same time here taking tangible, concrete steps to provide help,\" he added.

            "article_content": "Watch Elaine Quijano's full interview with Beto O'Rourke in the player at the top of the page.\u00a0 2020 Democratic presidential candidates were quick to pounce on Joe Biden's support for the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for abortions in most cases, though they were reluctant to call him out by name. But in an exclusive interview with CBSN's Elaine Quijano on Wednesday, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke went further than his fellow competitors and said Biden's stance on abortion was \"absolutely wrong.\" \"I hope Joe Biden rethinks his position on this issue,\" O'Rourke said. \"Perhaps he doesn't have all the facts. Perhaps he doesn't understand who the Hyde Amendment hurts the most...lower income communities, communities of color. I would ask that he rethink his position on this.\" O'Rourke has taken pains on the campaign trail to avoid criticizing fellow Democratic contenders, and has made civility a cornerstone of his message. But the news on Wednesday that the former Vice President still backs the Hyde Amendment, which O'Rourke and other 2020 Democrats want to repeal, opened up another significant divide between Biden and the rest of the field.  While Biden supports abortion rights, he is also a staunch Catholic who invokes his faith on the campaign trail. When asked by an ACLU volunteer at a campaign event recently whether he would commit to supporting the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, he agreed. Yet his campaign said he misheard the question and that he still supports the amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortions except in cases of incest, rape or the life of the mother. The funds are usually distributed through Medicaid. Several 2020 contenders, O'Rourke included, say the amendment would disproportionately impact low income women and women of color, and have called for a repeal. O'Rourke's response comes as the former Texas congressman is rebooting his presidential campaign after a lackluster start. Part of that effort includes releasing policy proposals, from immigration reform to addressing climate change. On Wednesday, O'Rourke introduced a sweeping voting rights proposal on that aims to increase registration by 50 million, with the goal of boosting voter turnout to 65 percent. The plan also calls for term limits for some federal offices -- including an 18-year term limit for Supreme Court justices. Several 2020 candidates have called for reforming the high court in response to recent federal and local decisions, and vacancies that have shifted the ideological makeup of the judiciary. But O'Rourke disagreed with some proposals put forth by other candidates to expand the number of seats on the court, after saying he might consider it earlier this year. \"I don't know if that's the right way,\" he told CBSN. \"That further entrenches or enshrines the partisanship we're seeing play out in the court right now.\" O'Rourke's plan would establish Election Day as a national holiday and implement same-day and automatic voter registration, including pre-registration for 15- and 16-year-olds. O'Rourke would also call on Congress to pass legislation that allows people without identification to vote. He's also proposing a constitutional amendment to institute a 12-year term limit for both the House and Senate, in an effort to inspire more people to run for office. The former congressman also told CBSN he would support the Democratic challenger to his former House colleague, Republican Will Hurd, in Texas' 23rd Congressional district. O'Rourke was criticized in 2018 for not endorsing Gina Ortiz Jones, who ended up losing by less than a thousand votes. O'Rourke and Hurd are friendly, and the two garnered national attention in 2017 for live streaming their drive together from Texas to Washington when weather canceled their flights.\u00a0 \"I will very likely support the nominee in that rce. I'm a big fan of Gina,\" O'Rourke told CBSN. \"I don't want to put my thumb on the scale...but should she be the nominee I will be supporting her.\" O'Rourke, who is from the border town of El Paso, has also made immigration a central piece of his campaign. He told CBSN that President Trump's proposed tariffs on Mexico \"is about the dumbest idea, economically, the president has come up with.\" He also responded to a new Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday that showed 60 percent of Democrats in Texas want him to abandon his presidential race to run for Senate against Republican incumbent John Cornyn. \"I think they want to see Texas represented in the United States Senate by someone who represents our values,\" he told CBSN. \"I'm a known quantity....when they get a chance to meet some of these contenders, like MJ Hager, they are going to be very pleased.\"\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

Steve King, who was stripped of his committee assignments by the House GOP leadership earlier after making a string of racist statements, says his political travails have given him \"better insight\" into what Jesus Christ went through. \u00a0 King was removed from his committee assignments after he appeared to express confusion about why the term\u00a0\"white supremacist\"\u00a0had became unacceptable during a January interview with The New York Times.

            "article_content": "Watch the new CBSN Originals documentary, \"(Un)Welcome: Sweden's Rise of the Right,\" in the video player above. For decades, Sweden opened its door to refugees, but now far-right populists are gaining power and pushing back, challenging the nation's reputation for tolerance and generosity. The number of people displaced worldwide by conflict has reached a record high, according United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). \u00a0In recent years, as far-right, anti-immigrant groups seized headlines and challenged the political status quo across Europe, Sweden set itself apart, rolling out the welcome mat for refugees. \"My Europe takes in people fleeing from war, my Europe does not build walls,\" Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven announced to a crowd in Stockholm in 2015. Sweden had taken refugees for decades, but in 2015 it accepted more refugees per capita than any other country. Nearly 163,000 people, mostly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, applied for asylum in Sweden that year. To help newcomers assimilate, Sweden offers publicly funded integration programs. Migrants get Swedish language lessons and learn about the culture. In Ronneby, a small industrial town in the south of Sweden, there's even a 10-week physical fitness program to help encourage healthy habits and accustom new arrivals to the Swedish devotion to fitness. \"We need a strong welfare state, a network for everyone, so they can feel included,\" said Henrik L\u00f6vgren, who launched the Ronneby program. But not everyone supports these efforts, and political parties with platforms calling for stricter immigration policies are on the rise. Support for the Sweden Democrats, a far-right political party with neo-Nazi roots, increased from 5.7 percent of the vote in 2010 to 17.5 percent in the September 2018 elections. Fueled by anti-immigrant sentiment, the party is promoting slogans like \"Keep Sweden Swedish.\" Under party leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson since 2005, the Sweden Democrats shed ties with those who openly espoused white supremacist and neo-Nazis views, while like-minded right-wing populist movements gained traction across Europe. Its views are amplified by alternative news sites like Nyheter Idag (\"News Today\"), which regularly features stories linking newly arrived immigrants to crime. \"If the guy who did a crime is an immigrant, we write it,\" said editor-in-chief Chang Frick, who also has links to the Sweden Democrats. According to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, overall reported crimes increased by 2 percent in 2018, with much of the uptick due to fraud cases. The number of reported rapes rose by 8 percent, while sexual abuse declined 3 percent. Though statistics don't point to a clear trend, many share a perception that crime is concentrated in ethnic enclaves where many recent immigrants have settled. Chang argues that mainstream news sites refuse to make a connection between crime and immigration. \"Mainstream media is covering a lot of the immigrant issues, but with a view on immigrants (like) we have to take care of them, like they're small kids, they're always the victim,\" he said. \"A kid can't be the bad guy.\" In some of Sweden's smaller towns that have taken in significant numbers of refugees, the message of the alternative media and political right wing is resonating. Ronneby, with a population of just 13,000, has taken in 2,400 refugees. Some locals say the new immigrants make them feel uneasy. \"This is not the same Ronneby, this is not the same country as it was once before,\" says Nicolas Westrup, leader of the Sweden Democrats' Ronneby chapter. \u00a0\"I feel that we are closely or slowly changing the population of Ronneby.\" Westrup, who was born in Majorca, Spain, and moved to Sweden as a teenager, insists he doesn't mind taking in immigrants as long as their culture mirrors Swedish culture. \"Many years ago we had people coming in from Yugoslavia and they had the same culture as we have in Scandinavia, or Europe. But the people from Africa, they don't have the same culture,\" he said, adding, \"If you want a job here, take off your hijab.\" But others in Ronneby see the talk of blaming immigrants for rising crime as political maneuvering, and view Westrup himself with suspicion. Westrup acknowledges his father was a Nazi \u2014 but says that has nothing to do with him or his views on what's good for Ronneby. Critics accuse those on the far right of stoking fear to advance their political objectives.\u00a0 Malin Norfall of the Social Democrats, the nation's oldest and largest political party, whose platform opposes the stances of the Sweden Democrats, had harsh words for Westrup. \"You have told them to be afraid. You have stand out on the square and telling them that they should be afraid and what they should be afraid of,\" Norfall said. \"As a politician, you have a responsibility to \u2026 go on facts. But you're not.\" Other countries have seen more extreme nationalist and nativist uprisings than Sweden, and a harsher anti-immigrant backlash. But when a growing minority in such a welcoming and tolerant society taps into an undercurrent of resentment and fear, it can signal a tectonic shift with lasting and unpredictable consequences. In Frick's view, Sweden is a nation of extremes that's ripe for a sharp rightward turn. \"If it was very politically correct here, it will go to the other extreme,\" he said. \u00a0\"Sweden still is always like extremes. Now everyone will become super nationalistic.\"",

On Friday, Mr. Trump traveled to Calexico, California, where he'll be dropping by a section of what his administration is calling new fencing that will stop the surge of migrant families coming to the U.S. in recent months.\u00a0 He tweeted\u00a0Friday, \"Will soon be landing in Calexico, California to look at a portion of the new WALL being built on our Southern Border,\" and maintained that \"within two years we will have close to 400 miles built or under construction.\"   But the portion of fence that Mr. Trump is touring is a two-mile section that was a long-planned replacement for an older barrier, rather than \"new\" wall, despite what the president has asserted in recent days. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen marked the section with a plaque bearing Mr. Trump's name last year.\u00a0 \"This plaque was installed on October 26, 2018, to commemorate the completion of the first section of President Trump's border wall,\" the plaque reads.\u00a0 The southern border is nearly 2,000 miles long and already has about 650 miles of different types of barriers, including short vehicle barricades and tall, steel fences up to 30 feet high. Most of the fencing, however, was built during the administration of George W. Bush, and have been updated and maintained throughout other administrations. Mr. Trump has yet to complete any new mileage of fencing or other barriers anywhere on the border. His administration has only replaced existing fencing, including the section he is touring Friday. Construction for that small section of fencing cost about $18 million, began in February 2018 and was completed in October. Plans to replace that fence date to 2009, during the beginning of President Barack Obama's tenure. Mr. Trump walked away from his border closure threat just days after he also abruptly postponed Republican efforts to work on a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. After the border visit, Mr. Trump travels to Los Angeles, where he'll attend a pair of fundraisers. Then, he'll go to Las Vegas for another re-election fundraiser and an address to the Republican Jewish Coalition, which is backed by GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson.",

            "article_content": "John Kelly, President Trump's former chief-of-staff, appeared to part ways with several of the administration's immigration policies, including Mr. Trump's promise that a \"big, beautiful\" wall must be built along the southern border, in a wide-ranging discussion at Duke University on Wednesday.\u00a0 Kelly, who also served as Mr. Trump's Homeland Security secretary, said it's his view that \"we don't need a wall from, you know, sea to shining sea.\" He suggested that Customs and Border Patrol agents would agree that a physical barrier in many places \"seems like an awful waste of money,\" and appeared to question whether the crisis at the southern border needed to be deemed a national emergency at all.\u00a0 \"If I told them 'I can get you 2,000 miles [of wall],' they'd say 'that seems like an awful waste of money' because they don't need it everywhere is the point. So, the physical barrier in some places, many places backed up the CBP people, men and women, that have great people...and they use a great deal of technology, sensors, things like that, towers, drones. So, is it an emergency?\" said Kelly.\u00a0 Despite the potential logistical difficulties presented by building a wall, and the obvious legal and funding challenges he currently faces as Democrats lead an effort to block his national emergency declaration, Mr. Trump has remained firm that a wall is the only way to truly secure the border. Kelly also appeared to disagree with Mr. Trump's view that many crossing the border illegally are \"rapists\" or drug dealers. \"They're overwhelmingly not criminals,\" Kelly said Wednesday. \"They're people coming up here for economic purposes. I don't blame them for that.\" Kelly also wouldn't say if he fully supported Mr. Trump's national emergency declaration, explaining, \"So long as [the declaration is] legal and within the authority of the president, you do it.\" He went on to say that he believed the national emergency issue would be \"wrapped up in the courts\" as it continues to face mounting legal challenges.\u00a0 Kelly said, however, that the larger issue of the border \"gets into the alienation and lack of bipartisanship that we seem to be crippled with.\" Kelly noted that in the past some Democrats had signed onto the idea of expanding physical barriers along the southern border in the early 2000s.\u00a0 In response to some border states\u00a0pulling back their national guard troops from the southern border, Kelly said that the military does not generally enjoy being deployed for domestic operations.\u00a0 \"We have a long, long tradition of fighting the away game and have real sense that except for natural disasters, to interact domestically is something that most -- I would say all -- military people prefer not to do,\" said Kelly. He added that while National Guard troops might operate drones or provide logistical support to law enforcement, \"I would look for another way to do it rather than deploy federal troops on the border.\" Kelly also said that the administration's decision to implement a \"zero tolerance\" policy of separating children from migrant parents illegally crossing the border\u00a0surprised federal agencies.\u00a0 \"It certainly caught [Homeland Security] and [Health and Human Services] flat footed,\" said Kelly. The policy has since been discontinued.\u00a0 And despite criticism of how they handled the care of young migrants detained along the border, Kelly argued that the administration \"did the best we could.\" \"They do the best they can to take care in the right way but it is still a dorm-type facility and, in many ways, better than where they came from,\" Kelly explained of the detention facilities along the U.S-Mexico border. \"So, not the best policy and I would say it caught people in the government flat-footed and we spent a fair amount of time trying to play catch up.\" Looking back on his career, Kelly suggested that if the 2016 election had gone the other way, he \"would have probably\" agreed to serve as secretary Clinton's chief of staff. \u00a0 \"Politics aside, it's all about governing the country. We are in good and bad times, there's many threats around the world. Many threats socially or domestically. And love 'em or hate 'em, whoever it happens to be, once they become president, it's in our interest as a people to assist him or her as much as we can to be successful.\"\u00a0 Abby Kingsley, a sophomore and public policy major at Duke University, contributed to this report.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "An additional 2,000 to 3,000 troops are expected to be sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, CBS News' David Martin reported Wednesday. This comes one day after acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters \"several thousand\" additional troops would be required to offer additional support to administration efforts to prevent illegal immigration. There are around 2,400 troops currently at the border, and Pentagon officials told the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday the deployment of troops to the border would cost over $600 million by the end of the fiscal year. The expenses for the active-duty troops who were ordered there in October will be around $132 million by the end of January, according to Pentagon estimates. The Trump administration announced the deployment of 5,000 troops to the border in anticipation of the\u00a0arrival of large migrant caravans\u00a0in late October. President Trump told reporters the day before the midterm elections that up to 15,000 troops could be sent to the border. Democrats argued Mr. Trump was exploiting border security concerns for political reasons. Shanahan told reporters Wednesday the role of the troops would remain the same: Assisting Customs and Border Protection agents with logistics, surveillance, and building and reinforcing concertina wire fencing. \"It's not about undertaking a law enforcement position,\" Shanahan said. Shanahan's announcement comes amid congressional negotiations on a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spending bill aimed at reaching an agreement on border security funding before funding lapses on Feb. 15. The federal government is now back at work after a 35-day shutdown over $5.7 billion for a southern border wall or barrier sought by Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump is mulling calling a national emergency to build the wall if Congress is unable to come to a deal to fund it. Shanahan said Tuesday if the president declares a national emergency the Pentagon would do the planning and recommend what is necessary to support the request.

            "article_content": "With trust in governments taking a hit since the global financial crisis, people around the world view their employer as the most trusted institution in their lives, according to a survey published Monday. In a survey of trust in institutions that public relations firm Edelman releases each year on the eve of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, the firm found that 75 percent of respondents trusted their employer. That's a hefty 19 percentage points more than the equivalent trust in business as a whole and 27 points more than governments. \"The past two decades have seen a progressive destruction of trust in societal institutions, a consequence of the Great Recession, fears about immigration and economic dislocation caused by globalization and automation,\" said Richard Edelman, the firm's president and CEO. \"People have low confidence that societal institutions will help them navigate a turbulent world, so they are turning to a critical relationship: their employer.\" Waning trust in public institutions in recent years has accompanied a rise in populist and nationalist politics, from the election of President Donald Trump to Britain's vote to leave the European Union. And over the past year, the #MeToo movement has spread from Hollywood into the political and corporate worlds, while the yellow vest movement in France \u2014 initially a protest over a fuel tax \u2014 has shaken the country and caused President Emmanuel Macron to backtrack on some reforms. The survey also found the largest ever difference in trust in public institutions between wealthier people with college educations and poorer ones without degrees. Part of the reason is that wealthier individuals could have benefited more from the stock market boom and economic growth of the past few years. The gap, of 16 percentage points overall, was highest in the U.K., at 24 points, illustrating the deep divides in the country as it prepares to leave the EU. Edelman thinks businesses have to play a central role in restoring trust in institutions. Firms, he said, should try to have a social impact and accept they have a duty of care toward the places that they operate. He noted Microsoft's pledge last week to invest $500 million in affordable housing in Seattle. Edelman also urged firms to empower employees and for CEOs to speak up on social issues such as immigration and diversity. \"This is the path that business must follow to help restore trust,\" he said. Edelman's online survey between Oct. 19, 2018, and Nov. 16, 2018, took place in 27 markets and involved more than 33,000 respondents.",

            "article_content": "In what would be a troubling sign for Republicans ahead of next year's elections, Democrats have a shot at seizing the governor's mansions in two Southern states President Trump won handily in 2016. In Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin is looking to keep his job amid a strong challenge from Democrat Andy Beshear, the state's attorney general. Meanwhile in Mississippi, Democrat Jim Hood could pull off an upset win against Republican Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves, the GOP's gubernatorial nominee.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has held rallies for the Republican nominees in both states as Republicans try to focus both races on national issues such as immigration and impeachment. The president remains popular in Kentucky and Mississippi and hopes he can turn out his base in what are typically low-turnout elections.\u00a0 Democrats, on the other hand, are trying to keep the focus on local issues in the hopes that they can cobble together enough voters to beat the GOP in these ruby-red states.\u00a0 Here's what's happening in Kentucky and Mississippi ahead of Tuesday's elections.\u00a0 Republican Governor Matt Bevin's latest pitch to Kentucky voters could be summed up with two signs at his rally last Saturday.\u00a0 One featured a picture of a baby and promoted Bevin as \"America's Most Pro-Life Governor.\" The other featured a picture of the governor and Mr. Trump on the staircase of Air Force One and a caption, \"A terrific man. And a terrific Governor. - President Donald Trump.\" \"Every candidate on this side, pro-life, pro-second amendment, pro-president, pro-America, pro-working class individual. On the other side, the same is just not true,\" Bevin said at the event in Clark County. \"Vote your values and not your party.\" Kentucky law prevented governors from running for re-election until 1992. Since then, no Republican has gotten a second term, despite the fact that the state is dominated by Republicans at the federal level and hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1996. The Bluegrass state has a history of electing Democratic governors even as it regularly sends Republicans to Washington. In 2007, they elected Steve Beshear, who won again in 2011. Now his son, state Attorney General Andy Beshear, is looking to return the governor's mansion to Democratic hands.\u00a0 In 2015, Bevin beat his Democratic opponent in a surprise landslide, with voters decisively breaking his way in the week before Election Day. It was something of a comeback win for Bevin, a millionaire businessman who had never held elected office but who had tried to beat Senator Mitch McConnell in the 2014 Republican primary. McConnell won that race by nearly 40 points.\u00a0 This time around, Bevin has had to deal with sky-high disapproval ratings. He was the most unpopular governor in the nation for the most of the summer, according to Morning Consult, and had\u00a0alienating spats\u00a0with teachers over their pension fund.\u00a0 National Democrats encouraged Beshear, the state's attorney general, to take on Bevin by building off the support of teachers and state workers. According to Robert Goe, a former Republican candidate for state representative, Beshear's strength among public sector workers has helped keep Beshear competitive.\u00a0 \"You take your state workers, you take your teachers, you take friends and family, that's a lot of votes. That's why I think it's close,\" he told CBS News.\u00a0 Goe is an adamant Bevin supporter, in part due to the state's strong economy and shrinking unemployment rate. But like many voters in Kentucky, he also likes Bevin's conservative stances on guns and abortion.\u00a0 This melding of social and economic issues looks a lot like the strategy Mr. Trump is likely to deploy next year. Beshear, meanwhile, has said repeatedly that he supports abortion rights and accused Bevin of opposing the procedure even in cases of rape or incest.\u00a0 Democrats in Kentucky have framed Tuesday's vote as a referendum on Bevin and focused on local issues such as education and healthcare. At the recent Carl D. Perkins Memorial Breakfast in Pike County, in the heart of the state's coal country, Beshear said the state cannot \"survive another four years of Matt Bevin.\" \"You all know what's on the line. The future of education because it doesn't survive another four years under Matt Bevin. The future of rural healthcare because it doesn't survive another four years under Matt Bevin. We've got a governor that brags about prosperity, but do you see it right here?\" Alongside Bevin in coal country was state Representative Rocky Adkins, a former primary opponent of Beshear who\u00a0won a lot of these Eastern Kentucky counties\u00a0when Democrats chose their nominee in May. In a similar move, Vice President Mike Pence was deployed to the state on Friday to rally voters in heavily Republican areas Bevin lost in the primaries.\u00a0 Mr. Trump, who won the state by 30 points, will be holding a rally for Bevin in Lexington on Monday. Republicans hope that they can inspire enough of the GOP faithful to show up and pull Bevin across the finish line, and of the three gubernatorial races scheduled for November, the president's support may matter here the most.\u00a0 \"Turnout is always been low in Kentucky for these off-year elections. Last time when I won it was in the low thirties. It's going to be somewhere in the mid-thirties, I would say. What the president coming does is just reminds people, 'Oh, there's an election tomorrow?' It actually reminds people that tomorrow is Election Day. So that's good, no matter how people vote,\" Bevin told reporters in Winchester.\u00a0 David Turner, a Democratic Governors Association spokesperson, said he was confident people would vote on local issues like health care and education, regardless of whether they support Mr. Trump.\u00a0 \"I think this is a test theory about whether voters are going to vote on their local issues that they say poll after poll are most important to them,\" Turner told CBS News. \"Or they're going to vote based on who's in what party.\" Despite Mississippi's well-earned reputation as a Republican stronghold, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jim Hood is a formidable candidate. The four-term attorney general won every county in the state for the primary, and by a wide-margin in previous state elections despite Mississippi's pronounced conservative lean.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves, the GOP nominee, has had his work cut out for him.\u00a0 Despite being the right-hand man to current Governor Phil Bryant, who is very popular in the state, Reeves struggled to win the Republican nomination. He was unable to win the GOP nod outright in May, and only secured the nomination after a run-off in August.\u00a0 But this is still a Republican state, and the latest Mason-Dixon poll shows Reeves with a slight edge over Hood. The Democrat's internal polling, meanwhile, shows Hood beating Reeves by a similarly narrow margin.\u00a0 Mr. Trump recently held a rally here to get his base fired up. During his appearance, the president said he was surprised to be in Mississippi fighting for a Republican to win a gubernatorial race.\u00a0 \"You know, I can't believe this is a competitive race. It's like embarrassing. I'm talking Mississippi. I'm talking Mississippi. I can't believe it. I don't think that [Hood] should be the right guy. I think the guy you want is Tate Reeves.\" Supporters of Mr. Trump outside the rally told CBS News that they would vote for Reeves because of the president's endorsement. Chuck Mauney of Booneville refused to say anything bad about Hood but said he would vote for Reeves because \"it would do no good\" to vote for someone who wouldn't work with Mr. Trump.\u00a0 Unlike Beshear in Kentucky, Hood is an opponent of gun control and abortion rights. Hood has even been borrowing Trump's \"drain the swamp\" messaging and uses it against Reeves in\u00a0ads\u00a0and on the trail.\u00a0 In a press conference ahead of Mr. Trump's appearance in Tupelo, Hood said, \"I can't do anything about the swamp that the president is trying to clean up in Washington with all that bickering and things going on. But I can drain the swamp here that Tate Reeves has created.\" Hood is also distancing himself from national politics and will not comment on impeachment.\u00a0 \"I don't have a vote on that issue, like I said, I'm trying to drain the swamp here,\" Hood said.\u00a0 The battle between the two has instead leaned on state issues like education, Medicaid expansion and gas taxes.\u00a0Mississippi is one of 14 states\u00a0that didn't expand Medicaid in 2010, a policy Hood promises to reverse. Reeves, meanwhile, says that doing so would be an \"Obamacare expansion.\"\u00a0 \"Jim Hood will tell you that welfare and Washington are the only things we need,\" Reeves said after winning the Republican nomination.\u00a0 The Mississippi Strong PAC, backed by the Republican Governors' Association, has spent over\u00a0$2.37 million\u00a0to help Reeves. The Democratic Governors Association has pretty much spent an equal amount, with\u00a0$2.36 million in disbursements\u00a0for Hood.\u00a0 RGA spokesperson Amelia Chass\u00e9 Alcivar said Reeves has \"run a great campaign centered on the issues voters care about, and we feel strongly that he is going to be the next Governor of Mississippi.\" Reeves is banking that he can turn out Republican voters in a state Mr. Trump won by 17 points in 2016. The hope for Hood is that he can combine enough African American voters in cities like Jackson with rural white voters who backed Mr. Trump in the last presidential election.\u00a0 \"[Hood] has to have historically less-likely-to-vote people, show up to vote. It seems his task is harder. He's got to get the bump of African American turnout, he's got to get the bump of marginally engaged blue-collar Democrats in the state, or not get them to vote Republican,\" University of Mississippi political science professor John M. Bruce told CBS News. However, even if Hood keeps Reeves from winning a majority of the vote, there's still one more hurdle. A holdover rule from the Jim Crow-era states that a gubernatorial candidate must win at least 50 percent of the popular vote and 50 percent of the Mississippi's 122 state House districts.\u00a0 If no candidate does this, the state House of Representatives gets to pick the governor. Republicans hold a 74-44 majority in the state House, which could allow them to pick Reeves even if Hood wins more votes. However, a federal judge recently expressed \"grave concern\" about this quirk of the Mississippi electoral system, signaling that courts could get involved if the rule is activated, and an appeal is made.\u00a0 Eleanor Watson and Grace Segers contributed to this article.

            "article_content": "The way Mohammed Ewiess sees it, there was the time before President Trump and the time after.\u00a0 Before Mr. Trump, the President of Islamic Society of New Hampshire welcomed gatherings of 500 people or more to nighttime prayer during the holy month of Ramadan. The annual observance saw a full parking lot outside the Manchester mosque. Inside, a brimming community of bowed heads. \"We pray in rows. Four lines. Five lines. Six lines. This year, there were barely two lines of people. Eighty people total, maybe.\" Attendance dipped following the election of Mr. Trump, Ewiess told CBS News, then nearly halved in March following two consecutive terrorist attacks at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. \"I see it with my own eyes in the numbers,\" Ewiess exclaimed. \"People are afraid.\" Ewiess recalled experiencing a depression that began a day after the 2016 election. \"I don't know who told him to play this kind of game to win. But it worked.\"\u00a0 Ewiess paused to take a breath. \"He woke a lot of the hate up.\" The mosque welcomed Beto O'Rourke this past Friday. After taking off his shoes, O'Rourke he addressed members of the mosque, who were seated in a semi-circle.\u00a0 \"Somebody told me that the Mosque in Victoria, Texas had been burned to the ground on the day that Donald Trump had signed an executive order attempting to ban Muslim travel to the United States of America,\" O'Rourke told the room.\u00a0 \"We have to connect the dots and draw the conclusion that this is the most dangerous president the United States has ever had. He poses a threat to the well-being and the lives of our fellow Americans.\" Ahmed Chiboub of Litchfield, New Hampshire nodded his head in agreement. \"President Trump comes in all of a sudden and says Muslims are killers. Muslims are terrorists. And people believe him,\" he told CBS News. \"They hear my name. They think Ahmed is a terrorist.\" His wife, Amina Chiboub, motioned to the patrol officer pacing the perimeter three yards away. \"That's why you see the security guard. Still, we're not 100% safe.\" The mosque, a temporary space sandwiched in a strip-mall between a UPS store and an animal hospital, acquired the armed guard this spring. The society's permanent Manchester home, an octagonal brick building, sits unfinished, nearly two decades in the making and beleaguered by\u00a0graffiti and broken windows costing tens of thousands in repairs. Five months before the 2016 general election, Mr. Trump appeared just four miles away from the unfinished worship center. \"We are importing radical Islamic terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system,\" the then-candidate told audiences from behind a podium at St. Anselm College. \"Radical Islam is coming to our shores.\" In his own Manchester campaign appearance, O'Rourke recalled Mr. Trump's proposed \"Muslim ban\" and the confusion that ensued following\u00a0travel restrictions\u00a0barring citizens of seven predominantly Muslim nations entry into the United States.\u00a0 After stepping away from the campaign trail for more than a week following the El Paso shooting in August, O'Rourke vowed to visit some of the minority communities he says the president continues to attack. His first trip after the relaunch was to Mississippi where he visited immigrant communities that had just faced large scale raids from ICE agents. Friday's visit fit a similar mold. According to one ACLU study, a spike in anti-Muslim sentiment translated into over 330 incidents directed at mosques across the country since 2005. In a\u00a02017 survey of Muslim Americans, many Muslims reported experiences of discrimination, ranging from offensive name-calling to being singled out by airport security. A\u00a0recent study by Pew Research\u00a0found approximately 3.45 million Muslims live in the United States, with less than 1% residing in New Hampshire, which is home to just five mosques. Former state legislator Greg Salts called The Islamic Society of New Hampshire is \"a terrorist safe haven\" in 2017. \"There is a strong likelihood violent jihadist activity will be conducted by 'sleeper terrorists' attending this particular mosque,\" Salts said in his appearance before Manchester's board of aldermen. \"The mosque should be closed down immediately.\" He later apologized for his remarks.\u00a0 \"To be honest, I'm scared at times to come here for the prayers,\" Erum Usmani of Londonderry, New Hampshire told CBS News of the Manchester mosque. \"Because you never know. It's an open carry state. You worry about your kids.\" The former physician who calls herself \"as American as apple pie\" emigrated from Pakistan three decades ago. \"When I see Trump rallies, it literally gives me chills,\" Usmani said. \"Because my kids are born and bred here. They've never been made to feel like they are outsiders. And somehow, with this president, they're made to feel as if they don't belong.\" An independent voter, Usmani called it a \"mistake\" for candidates to bypass the Muslim community. \"We vote as a block. I remember the first time I voted was the George Bush election. He reached out to the Muslim community. And we voted for him,\" Usmani said.\u00a0 Tariq Omer echoed that sentiment after grabbing a selfie with O'Rourke.\u00a0 \"It's important to reach out to marginalized groups,\" the graduate student at Georgetown said. \"I feel like one of the mistakes Hillary Clinton might have made when she was campaigning \u2014I mean she won the popular vote, but she took a lot of her constituents for granted during her presidential campaign. It's nice to come out and get some face time with a community you may not be familiar with and pick up those anecdotes that you can drop during the presidential debate.\" O'Rourke will head to his home state of Texas for the third Democratic debate this week. Regardless of his performance on stage or this primary cycle, Mohammed Ewiess told CBS News the former Texas lawmaker is welcome back any time. \u00a0 Ewiess also told CBS News he sent a livestream link of O'Rourke's visit to family members and friends across the country. The video, he hopes, will help heal wounds he says were ripped open by the current administration.\u00a0 \"Why should we have to be cornered? Why should we have to feel guilty, like we have to prove we are innocent? America is bigger than that. Because it is a great place to live,\" Ewiess said, before pausing to reconsider. \u00a0 \"It was a great place to live.\" CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

            "article_content": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced the threat of being knocked from power after one term as the nation held parliamentary elections on Monday. The 47-year-old Trudeau channeled the star power of his father, the liberal icon and late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, when he won in 2015 but a combination of scandal and high expectations have damaged his prospects. Polls indicate Trudeau's Liberal Party could lose to the rival Conservatives, or perhaps win but still fail to get a majority of seats in Parliament and have to rely on an opposition party to remain in power. Not in 84 years has a first-term Canadian prime minister with a parliamentary majority lost a bid for re-election. Trudeau reasserted liberalism in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative Party government in Canada, but he is one of the few remaining progressive leaders in the world. He has been viewed as a beacon for liberals in the Trump era, even appearing on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine under the headline \"Why Can't He Be Our President?\" Perhaps sensing Trudeau is in trouble, Barack Obama made an unprecedented endorsement by a former American president in urging Canadians to re-elect Trudeau and saying the world needs his progressive leadership now. \u00a0 I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term. Trudeau responded to the former president's endorsement on Twitter, writing, \"Thanks my friend, we're working hard to keep our progress going.\" But old photos of Trudeau in blackface and brownface surfaced last month, casting doubt on his judgment. Trudeau also was hurt by a scandal that erupted this year when his former attorney general said he pressured her to halt the prosecution of a Quebec company. Trudeau has said he was standing up for jobs, but the damage gave a boost to the Conservative Party led by Andrew Scheer. No party is expected to get a majority of Parliament's 338 seats, so a shaky alliance may be needed to pass legislation. If Conservatives should win the most seats - but not a majority - they would probably try to form a government with the backing of Quebec's separatist Bloc Quebecois party. Trudeau's Liberals would likely rely on the New Democrats to stay in power. Scheer is a career politician described by those in his own party as bland, a possible antidote for those tired of Trudeau's flash. Scheer, 40, calls Trudeau a phony who can't even recall how many times he has worn blackface. Jason Kenney, Alberta's premier and a close friend of Scheer, calls the Conservative leader \"an extremely normal Canadian\" who is so nice he \"can't fake being mean.\" Scheer, however, has so relentlessly attacked Trudeau that Nik Nanos, a Canadian pollster, said he hasn't been himself. \"Scheer has been hostage to the message,\" Nanos said. \"His campaign has made him into an attack machine.\" Conservative supporters chanted \"Lock him up! Lock him up!\" at a rally Saturday after Scheer said he would investigate Trudeau's attorney general scandal - mirroring the Hillary Clinton \"Lock her up!\" chant popular at Donald Trump rallies. Scheer moved to calm the crowd and changed the chant to \"Vote him out.\" Trudeau embraced immigration at a time when the U.S. and other countries are closing their doors, and he legalized cannabis nationwide. His efforts to strike a balance on the environment and the economy have been criticized by both the right and left. He brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change but rescued a stalled pipeline expansion project to get Alberta's oil to international markets. His also negotiated a new free trade deal for Canada with the U.S. and Mexico amid threats by President Donald Trump to scrap it. Scheer is promising to end the carbon tax and cut government spending, including foreign aid, by 25%. \"That money belongs to you, not to them,\" Scheer said.",

The candidates on stage will be Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigeig, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang, Beto O'Rourke, and Julian Castro in that order from left to right at the podium in Houston on Sept 12.\u00a0 This marks the first time Biden and Warren will be meeting on the debate stage, and they'll both be standing front and center. Ten other candidates did not make the stage but are pushing forward in the race for the nomination. Read\u00a0here\u00a0what former campaign aides and strategists tell\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0about what\u00a0not\u00a0making the cut could mean for campaigns. BILL DE BLASIO Pressed by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0on the continuing controversy over New York City's handing of Eric Garner's death, Mayor Bill de Blasio deflected blame to the federal government and said, \"We've changed so much to make sure that will never happen again.\" At home, the mayor is under fire from Garner's family, who says the city didn't act quickly or thoroughly enough, and the NYPD union, which says that the officer involved was unfairly fired. \u00a0\u00a0 KAMALA HARRIS On Thursday Senator Kamala Harris introduced a new policy\u00a0plan\u00a0aimed at improving economic opportunity for people who are disabled. CBS News campaign reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0says part of the plan includes getting the \"Transformation to Competitive Employment Act\" passed. This would create a grant program that would help redesign business models to \"increase employment of people with disabilities in competitive integrated employment,\" according to the campaign. TOM STEYER Tom Steyer earned nearly $1 billion over the past 9 years, according a summary of the more than 2,500 pages of tax return documents the presidential hopeful released Thursday. Between his campaign to impeach President Trump and other political endeavors, Steyer and his wife Kat Taylor spent over $350 million over the same time span. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says the former hedge fund manager has pledged to spend $100 million of his own money in his run for president, and he is outspending every other candidate on advertising so far. IN THE SENATE Arizona Senator Martha McSally has a Republican primary challenger in her 2020 bid to win the Senate seat she was appointed to by Governor Doug Ducey, according to\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson.\u00a0 Daniel McCarthy officially launched his campaign on Wednesday. The businessman from Glendale, Arizona has been weighing whether or not to challenge her for a few months. In a conference call with supporters earlier this month, he said President Trump's\u00a0Twitter\u00a0endorsement of McSally won't deter him. \u00a0\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE Tuesday's WBTV-hosted debate between NC-09 candidates Republican Dan Bishop and Democrat Dan McCready started off with three national issues: health care, immigration and gun violence.\u00a0 The two Dans clashed the most over health care, with McCready going after Bishop \u2013 a state senator \u2013 for voting down a bill that would enable pharmacists to talk about cheaper drug alternatives with patients. Bishop pointed to his work on passing a companion bill, and then said McCready's health care plan would raise taxes.\u00a0 McReady's communications director, Matt Fried, told CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro,\"[Bishop's] record is pulling away people with pre-existing conditions from their healthcare. His record is making prescription drugs more expensive.\" A Bishop spokesperson said that McCready's accusation about the bill was a lie and suggested McCready's attacks were a little tired. \"Almost verbatim, the same lines he used against Mark Harris...you could go back to those debates in 2018, and he's maybe just wearing a different tie,\" Bishop's campaign said.\u00a0 This historically red district has become more competitive. After Donald Trump's 12-point win in 2016, McCready only lost by 905 votes in a 2018 race that was ultimately thrown out over ballot fraud.\u00a0 National figures are also gravitating to the special election. Yesterday, Donald Trump Jr. spoke at a Bishop fundraiser and former Vice President and presidential candidate Joe Biden endorsed McCready on\u00a0Twitter. President Trump is also holding a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Sept. 9 \u2013 one day before the general election. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Ten minutes passed, an iPhone alarm sounded, and half a dozen political organizers rotated clockwise around the room. \"We'll begin round two momentarily,\" Susan Jamback, chair of the Bow Democrats, said as she ping-ponged between wooden coffee tables littered with halved index cards reading \"immigration,\" \"healthcare,\" and \"impeachment,\" among other topics. Tucked in the Baker Free Library basement, a \"campaign speed-dating\" event paired individual Merrimack County Democrats with 2020 presidential staffers for intimate Q & A sessions, a compatibility test held 203 days before participants would cast the first Democratic primary ballots. A regional organizing director for Kamala Harris scribbled notes as one voter bemoaned rising insulin prices. Pete Buttigieg's deputy state director cited the South Bend mayor's re-election statistics when probed about America's \"readiness\" for a gay president. Bernie Sanders' constituencies director outlined his own experience entering the country as a refugee from Bhutan. \"Yes,\" one voter pushed back. \"But what will Sanders do to reunite separated families on day one?\" Miles removed from the shiny debate stages of Miami and Detroit, campaign staff and volunteers pitch their choice for president to 2.2% of America's registered voters, all of whom play an outsized role in selecting their party's nominee. Months before the first-in-the-nation primary, hundreds of political organizers have descended upon Manchester, working day after day to elect the next Democratic presidential nominee. In practice, it's called community organizing. In politics, it's called the ground game. And in New Hampshire, the candidate with the strongest ground game often clinches the February contest. \"The New Hampshire primary is really about developing those one-on-one relationships,\" state Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley told CBS News. \"And while the candidate can't possibly have a one-on-one relationship with every single voter, their supporters do.\" \"Everyone knows the campaign of Gary Hart because he built such a strong organization and ground game,\" Buckley said, referencing the Democratic Colorado senator's stunning 1984 upset victory. \"It's what made John Kerry in 2004, what saved Hillary in 2008.\" Getting involved in the primary is \"just part of the culture\" of New Hampshire, said Sue Casey, a top Democratic strategist in the state who has worked for numerous primary campaigns, including Hart's. \"In Boston, you root for the Red Sox. In New Hampshire, you participate in the most important political thing that happens in our country.\" Seasoned Granite State politicos use their own set of metrics in determining a candidate's strength. \"Anyone looking at the polls seven months before the election is focusing on the wrong thing,\" Ned Helms, a former chair of the state's Democratic Party and a supporter of Joe Biden, said. \"How many staffers are here? How many calls are you making? How many doors are you knocking on?\" In diners and debate watch parties, bookstores and barbecues, parks and pride parades, volunteers and hired hands sell their candidates to New Hampshire's skeptical and well-versed electorate. At a phone bank a week after the first presidential debate, former teacher Beth Gildea spent hours making cold calls to strangers on behalf of Kamala Harris. \"I think she's the one to take Donald Trump on,\" Gildea chirped into a cell phone. The 35-year old spends her time volunteering for the California senator while her two toddlers attend pre-school. \"Would you be interested in learning more about the campaign?\" Volunteer Kevin Danielson, leaned over the table to hear results of a\u00a0CBS News Poll showed a 32% plurality of voters perceived the California Senator to be \"strong,\"\u00a0with Biden and Elizabeth Warren trailing. \"Send that to me,\" he called out as the poll flashed on another volunteer's iPhone screen. The self-proclaimed \"Reagan Republican\" crossed the political aisle in 2016, and Danielson decided to back Harris in June. \"I want somebody who can beat Trump. Period, end of sentence.\" Harris' Granite State campaign says it will open four offices this month, following their candidate's sixth day campaigning in the state. Harris' team is one of nine campaigns boasting double-digit paid staff in New Hampshire, employing over twenty paid organizers and fellows. But its Warren's camp that carries the biggest footprint. While the campaign declined to divulge New Hampshire staff numbers, CBS News determined she has over 55 paid staff members the state, not including a handful volunteer fellows. The senator has spent fifteen days working the crowds in New Hampshire since announcing her exploratory bid in January. Her campaign organizers keep volunteers abreast of her dozens of policy rollouts with \"Night School with Warren.\" Business owner and former attorney Rebecca Prien spends every other Thursday night unraveling Warren's plans via PowerPoint before a dozen voters on New Hampshire's coast. \"Last month, we taught the ultra-millionaire's tax and real corporate profits tax,\" Prien explained. \"A lot of the discussion revolves around, 'how would you implement this?'\" Next week's lesson addresses climate change. Warren represents neighboring Massachusetts, giving her a home-field advantage here when it comes to name recognition and the ability to ferry in volunteers across the state line. Massachusetts candidates tend to do well in New Hampshire: Bay Staters like Mitt Romney, John Kerry, Paul Tsongas and Michael Dukakis have all won the primary. \u00a0 Bernie Sanders, who hails from neighboring Vermont, has a similar edge. The winner of the 2016 New Hampshire Primary announced 45 campaign staff in the state and counting last month. The campaign has also accrued the most individual contributions from New Hampshire residents this cycle, in addition to opening six offices and recruiting thousands of volunteers. One hundred eighty-five of those volunteers knocked on doors one balmy Saturday in late July. Rob Burns, a field organizer for Sanders based in Nashua, waved to a clipboard-equipped canvasser for Warren pacing the very same street, before entering Jeff Brown's front yard. Brown, a 60-year-old veteran, recounted his time serving overseas with the Army, the bouts of PTSD that followed, and time spent sleeping \"in the woods\" before finding work as a dishwasher. \"He's a nice guy,\" Brown said of Sanders. \"And he's from around here. But I'd like to have a politician in this frickin' country that's going to put a stop to the s--t.\"\u00a0 Brown wiped his tears. \"The same s--t is going on. What has changed?\" All campaigns are looking to tap into that sense of frustration with the status quo. Some candidates, like Sanders, preach revolution. Others, like Biden, pitch something more modest, a restoration to the pre-Trump era. While berry picking with organizers for Joe Biden in Coos County, Danielle Gilbert talked about 2016. The former police dispatcher and mother of two remembered the first time she spotted a Trump banner. \"There's the one in Belmont that's been up since before Trump announced he was officially running,\" Gilbert sighed. \"That sign never went away. That mentality never went away.\"\u00a0 Seven blueberries disappeared into her bucket. \"I don't know if Joe Biden will be a two-term president. Most likely he won't be because of his age. But we need to make sure we take back control of the country.\" Biden's team of over forty campaign staff began door-knocking last month, following their candidate's sixth day campaigning in state. August kicked off with a string of community events: A potluck in Keene, trivia in Manchester, a pie tasting in Wolfeboro. Former ambassador and co-chair of Bill Clinton's campaign Terry Shumaker noted that \"every election is different,\" but that Biden \u2013 his choice for the nomination \u2013 has \"grown his operation quickly\" despite a late entry into the race. Also growing \u2013 the campaigns of Beto O'Rourke, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar. Running on a message of what they call \"radical hope,\" O'Rourke's team of 25 paid staff emphasizes community service as they spread the word about the former Texas congressman. They spent this week assembling care packages for the families of victims of the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. The weekend before that, they cleaned up beaches on New Hampshire's narrow stretch of coastline. Gillibrand's entirely female senior staff in the state says they will onboard new organizers this month. They plan on reaching 25 full paid staff in August, following the senator's latest week-long New Hampshire tour. The New York senator has already spent a whopping 22 days campaigning in the state. \u00a0 Klobuchar's 18-member team unrolled nine key endorsements last month. The Minnesota senator had previously trekked through New Hampshire's sparsely-populated North Country in search of voters in remote parts of the state. Pete Buttigieg's operation has 40 paid staffers, and added a data director and four regional organizing directors last week. During the South Bend Mayor's twelve days of New Hampshire retail and town halls, nearly 600 Granite Staters attended multiple candidate events, according to the campaign. Last Sunday, 51 volunteers turned out to canvas alongside Chasten Buttigieg, the candidate's husband, and Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig. Cory Booker's team of nearly 30 paid staffers and ten interns also canvassed for down-ballot candidates last month, opened 3 field offices in the spring and boasts over four-dozen endorsements. According to the campaign, the New Jersey senator has personally interacted with over 4,000 Granite Staters in selfie lines and house party Q & A sessions. Metrics aside, how does a campaign know if their ground game is working, if their message resonates, if winning the primary is within reach?\u00a0 Just weeks before the 1984 Democratic primary, Sue Casey noted, her candidate had been all but written off by his opponents and the press -- little-known, young, from a faraway state. And then suddenly, almost without warning, Gary Hart caught fire on Election Day Eve. \u00a0\"It wasn't until we were sitting on the couch during the six o'clock news,\" Casey reminisced about the moment she knew it had worked just before the returns rolled in.\u00a0 \"And Dan Rather said, 'We don't know what's going to happen tonight, but we think Gary Hart is going to have a good night.' And we all looked at each other and we thought, could we win this? We could win this.\" CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

            "article_content": "Brussels -- Europeans woke Monday to a new political reality after European Parliament elections ended the domination of the EU's main center-right and center-left parties and revealed a changed political landscape where the far-right, pro-business groups and environmentalists will be forces to be reckoned with. Turning out in numbers not seen for 20 years, voters took their concerns about immigration and security to the ballot box, making parties led by the likes of Italy's populist Matteo Salvini and France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen among the biggest in the 28-nation bloc's assembly. \"The rules are changing in Europe,\" Salvini, Italy's hard-line interior minister, said at his League party headquarters in Milan early Monday. \"A new Europe is born.\" Voter projections showed the League won 33% of the vote, up from just 6% at the last European vote in 2014. The lion's share of Britain's seats went to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, as citizens punished the governing Conservatives and opposition Labour party for their embarrassing failure to manage the divided country's delayed departure from the EU. The newly formed Brexit Party won about 31% of the vote in Britain, but anti-Brexit parties, most pushing for a new public referendum on any eventual divorce deal or an effective do-over of the 2016 poll on whether to leave the EU in the first place, also fared well. The pro-Europe Liberal Democrats came in second place, taking about 19% of the vote. Riding what they called Europe's \"green wave\" backed by Europe-wide rallies urging climate action, environmentalist parties also made strong gains, notably in Germany, one of the continent's main forces for EU integration. The free-market liberals saw their stake in the 751-seat parliament rise to 107 seats, from 68 in 2014. The picture of a fractured assembly for the next five years was complete as many citizens turned their backs on the center-right European People's Party - one of its key figures, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saw her party lose ground - and the center-left Socialists. \"We are facing a shrinking center of the European Union parliament,\" a subdued EPP lead candidate Manfred Weber said, after just over 50 percent of the EU's more than 400 million voters had turned out over four days in the world's biggest transnational elections. \"From now on, those who want to have a strong European Union have to join forces.\" The Socialist lead candidate, Frans Timmermans, essentially conceded defeat, even though the two groups remain the assembly's biggest by some margin. \"If you lose an election, if you lose seats, you have to be modest,\" the former Dutch foreign minister said. \"We have lost seats and this means that we have to be humble.\" Spanish caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez was a notable exception, as his victorious Socialists looked set to win 20 of the country's 54 seats in the European Parliament. Although still trickling in, results show that the EPP is set to secure 179 seats, down from 217 five years ago. The Socialists are slated to win 150, down from 187. The two parties have dominated the parliament with a combined majority since elections were first held in 1979. Senior figures from the EPP hold the top posts in the EU's three main institutions: parliament president, head of the EU's powerful executive commission and European Council president, who chairs summits of European presidents and prime ministers. While real power in Europe remains in the hands of the 28 member states, the assembly's influence has grown. It's helped improve air flight safety in Europe, cut down on plastics use, end mobile telephone roaming charges inside the bloc, boost data privacy, and cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars. The parliament also has an important say in international treaties ranging from trade talks to Brexit. But now new, uncomfortable alliances must be forged. The pro-business liberals, or ALDE, backed by French President Emmanuel Macron - whose Republic on the Move party is set to win 23 seats, the same number as Le Pen's National Rally - insist that Europe's traditional political certainties are a thing of the past. \"The monopoly of power has been broken,\" said ALDE lead candidate Margrethe Vestager, currently the EU's competition commissioner, describing Sunday's polls as \"a signal for change.\" Party group leaders begin their horse-trading Monday to see what kind of stable alliance can be established and who might secure the EU's top jobs. Their decisions will set the stage for EU leaders, who wil meet over dinner Tuesday to see where the political pieces lie and discuss potential candidates.",

            "article_content": "On Wednesday night in Atlanta at the fifth Democratic presidential debate, candidates will likely be asked to respond to comments former President Obama made on Friday cautioning against radical change. During an interview with Stacey Abrams, Mr. Obama said, \"This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. They like seeing things improved, but the average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\" The remarks were first reported by the\u00a0New York Times. \u00a0 CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0says several of the candidates were asked about this over the weekend but did not bite.\u00a0 Senator Cory Booker says he wants to stop delineating left from right and said the nominee should have the full support of the party to defeat President Trump. Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose tagline is \"big, structural change,\" said she \"is so grateful for what Obama did\" on healthcare and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he agreed with the premise of Mr. Obama's comments and said the role of activists is to lead the country forward but politicians must still balance competing constituencies. \u00a0\u00a0 The candidates will likely have to answer whether the party is in a place to win over the\u00a0roughly eight million voters\u00a0who went for Mr. Obama in 2012 and Mr. Trump in 2016 as well as motivate turnout among African Americans and Latinos, a major problem for\u00a0Hillary Clinton in 2016. Democrats scored big wins in Louisiana and Kentucky's gubernatorial races this month. But in both cases, the Democratic candidates did not focus on the ambitious policies frequently discussed in the primary field, such as Medicare for All. Mr. Obama was\u00a0also a topic of discussion\u00a0at the debate in July when candidates argued over whether or not Obamacare went far enough as well as that administration's immigration policies. On Friday, Mr. Obama indirectly responded to those comments in his interview with Abrams. \"I don't take it as a criticism when people say hey, it's great, Obama did what he did and now we want to do more. That's the point.\" Is President Obama right \u2013 do Americans want more gradual change? In this special\u00a0DEBATE\u00a0edition of Trail Markers, the\u00a0CBS News Political Unit\u00a0gives a rundown of what to watch for from the 10 presidential candidates who made it to the stage plus other political news of the day. JOE BIDEN VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON\u00a0While Democrats are united in criticizing Mr. Trump for asking the Ukrainian government to investigate the Biden family, it's a much more personal topic for the former vice president.\u00a0 With the House impeachment hearings in full force, Biden has continued to defend himself and his son, Hunter, from the Trump administration's allegations of wrongdoing in Ukraine. The keen interest the administration has taken in the Bidens is now a main topic of the former vice president's trail speeches, where it is cited as proof that the president thinks Biden would be his toughest general election opponent.\u00a0 At Wednesday's debate, Biden can be expected to try and turn Mr. Trump's accusations into an advantage. And the former vice president also says that Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un are worried about a potential Biden presidency. North Korean state media recently called Biden a \"rabid dog,\" a phrase Biden laughs at.\u00a0 By highlighting both Mr. Trump's request to Ukraine and the barbs from foreign adversaries\u2014whom he calls \"thugs\"\u2014Biden underscores his foreign policy experience, which he sees as a key selling point to voters. Having spent much of the last 50 years as a powerful lawmaker steeped in foreign policy discussions, he says he knows intimately what makes leaders like Kim and Putin tick.\u00a0Will he proactively start contrasting this record with the other Democrats? CORY BOOKER VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN\u00a0At a Nevada Democrats First in the West event Sunday night, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker said the presidential election is \"not about left or right. It is about right and wrong.\" At the last debate, Booker kept his focus on Mr. Trump and mostly avoided criticizing his fellow Democrats. And at a California Democratic Party Convention in Long Beach this past weekend, Booker reiterated that Democrats need to concentrate on winning back the White House instead of infighting. \"I'm happy to be in this field and plan on winning, but the one thing I'm going to stop is us tearing each other down,\" Booker told reporters.\u00a0After months of struggling in the polls, will Booker look to throw some punches at his Democratic competitors? Or will he continue to focus on Mr. Trump?\u00a0 PETE BUTTIGIEG VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN\u00a0South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg drew sharp contrasts with his progressive competitors, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, on health care in the last debate. In contrast to Warren and Sanders' embrace of \"Medicare for All,\" which would eliminate most private insurance plans, Buttigieg's health care plan calls for a public option and does not eliminate private insurance plans.\u00a0 Buttigieg specifically asked Warren if her plan would increase taxes on middle class families, which the Massachusetts Senator has been loath to admit. \"Your signature senator is to have a plan for everything, except this,\" Buttigieg said at the last debate.\u00a0 Ahead of Wednesday's debate, Warren has released two more plans on health care: one indicating that her plan would not increase taxes on middle class families and the other detailing a health care bill that includes an expansive public option that she says she would work to pass before Medicare for All. Meanwhile, two polls in the last week, including a\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0poll, showed Buttigieg rising in Iowa. And with less than 80 days until the Iowa caucus, Buttigieg's competitors may start redirecting their fire toward the millennial mayor.\u00a0How will Buttigieg fend off potential attacks now that polling shows him in the top tier of candidates? TULSI GABBARD VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN\u00a0Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who memorably dinged California Senator Kamala Harris at a debate earlier this year, went on the attack against Elizabeth Warren in the last debate. Gabbard has redirected her focus to Hillary Clinton since then, a response to the former Democratic nominee's insinuation that the dovish congresswoman is a \"favorite of the Russians.\" Gabbard's campaign lawyer released a letter to Clinton, who recently indicated that she could still run for president, saying that she defamed Gabbard and demanded a retraction.\u00a0Will Gabbard try to criticize Warren again and will she continue to go after Clinton?\u00a0 KAMALA HARRIS VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER TIM PERRY\u00a0Heading into the debate, Kamala Harris has seen a sharp decline in her poll numbers and has had to make major layoffs and changes with her staff. When asked how she plans to prepare for such a crucial debate, Harris jokingly said \"prayer,\" but added, \"I'm going to just be present.\" \u00a0 While Pete Buttigieg continues to surge in the polls, Harris took her first jab at the South Bend mayor when asked about reports of his campaign using a stock photograph of a Kenyan woman on his website to promote a plan targeted at African Americans. Though Harris laughed at the report, she warned that the Democratic nominee must have to have the ability to \"unify the party and the country,\" and added \"and you can't unify folks if you don't understand who they are and their specific needs and the right that they have to be represented based not on a stock photograph, but [on] who they actually are.\"\u00a0Is this the sign of more attacks to come in the surging mayor's direction?\u00a0 AMY KLOBUCHAR VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON\u00a0If the past is any indication, a solid debate performance by Klobuchar could lead to more money and a bounce in the polls. The Minnesota senator had her best fundraising spree ever after the last debate, quickly raising $1.1 million dollars.\u00a0 Since then, other candidates like Harris and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro have changed their campaign strategies to free-up cash and refocus their efforts. Klobuchar, meanwhile, recently boasted in New Hampshire that while her campaign prides itself on being \"frugal,\" they were looking to add staffers and offices, at least in Iowa. The big moments for Klobuchar at the last debate were her strong but polite criticisms of some progressive policies, such as Medicare for All and forgiving student loans. Klobuchar argues that she can deliver better, more politically realistic policies, such as a public option for healthcare and free community college.\u00a0What will be the key policy difference she highlights this time?\u00a0 BERNIE SANDERS VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER CARA KORTE\u00a0The big question in last month's debate for Bernie Sanders was how he would perform just a few weeks after his heart attack, a test he passed easily. Since then, Sanders has seen bumps in polling while Warren has struggled.\u00a0 How can he keep that momentum rolling in the debate? Essentially, just by maintaining his status quo. His campaign argues that folks at home know Bernie Sanders. They know that his signature policy is Medicare for All. They know that he's 78 years old.\u00a0 The Sanders campaign says their path to victory is all about turnout, particularly among those who have never voted before. Young people, the working class, and people of color are the wind in Sanders' sails.\u00a0 Are those the voters watching on debate night? Perhaps. But it's more likely Sanders will speak reach these people on the trail, or through door knocking and phone banking. Still, Sanders needs those committed Democrats watching every debate night closely.\u00a0Can he win them over with a winning debate performance? He hasn't had any major flubs yet on stage, so if they haven't come to him now, will they ever?\u00a0\u00a0 TOM STEYER VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK\u00a0Tom Steyer's ad blitzes have kept him on the debate stage, but the billionaire climate activist will likely need earned media to rise above his middle-of-the-road polling numbers. The debate stage is an opportunity for him to tout his status as the earliest candidate to call for Mr. Trump's impeachment. But with campaign scandals in both Iowa and South Carolina since the last debate,\u00a0Steyer could himself be a target for any opponent looking to score easy points.\u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK Over the past month, Elizabeth Warren has faced more criticism than at any point since the early days of her campaign. The drama began at the last debate when her opponents swung at her from all sides.\u00a0 Since then, she's released significant details on her plans to pay for Medicare for All and get congress to pass it. But that's opened her policies to new scrutiny. With the release of a 3-year plan leading up to a push for the original Medicare for All bill, Warren could face attacks from both her right and her left on where she now stands on health care. But while she walked onto the stage last month as the biggest target in the field, Buttigieg's recent polling surge in Iowa could distract some of the candidates looking for blood.\u00a0Will her rivals continue to pile-on Warren, or will they move on to other top candidates like Biden and Buttigieg?\u00a0 ANDREW YANG VIA CBS NEWS POLITICAL UNIT ASSOCIATE PRODUCER BEN MITCHELL\u00a0While Andrew Yang's poll numbers continue to hover somewhere between 2% and 4% in the early states, the campaign insists they're exactly where they want to be right now. Yang is still bringing in plenty of donations, his campaign is hiring new people every week and voters are still getting to know him, campaign staffer argue, which leaves room for growth. They also point to other campaigns that are hemorrhaging support and money.\u00a0 But in the latest\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker, just 12% of all voters in the early primary and caucus states through Super Tuesday say they are considering Yang. The campaign has done well to build support in online communities, but it is trying to spread the candidate's message to a wider audience. Last week, the Yang campaign launched a 7-figure ad buy in the early primary states with glossy ads focused on his health care policies and economic populism.\u00a0 A strong debate performance, coupled with the massive buy, could provide a one-two punch for Yang and help him connect with voters who really haven't paid much attention to him yet. He will likely stick to his vision of \"human-centered capitalism\" to help workers navigate the changing economy and talk about his plan for \"a new way forward\" in the 21st century, but voters could also hear more personal stories from Yang. He's recently started branding himself as a \"parent and a patriot\" in his ads and on the stump. But will this message resonate enough with voters to give the candidate a needed boost?\u00a0\u00a0 IOWA Since entering the race last spring, former\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0has slipped eight points in Iowa, according to the latest\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0poll. Biden continues to lead nationally and remains a top-tier candidate for his party's nomination, but in interviews during the first two weeks of November with a dozen top Democratic leaders, officials and strategists, many\u00a0expressed concerns\u00a0to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Adam Brewster\u00a0about Biden's standing in Iowa.\u00a0 \"I wouldn't count him out, but there's certainly been some troubling signs,\" said former Democratic political operative Grant Woodard, who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2008 Iowa campaign. A top Iowa Democrat said the former vice president doesn't have the \"intensity of support\" that other candidates have shown, adding, \"If he's not in the top three it's over.\"\u00a0 Some Democratic leaders and officials cited other hurdles for Biden, such as his struggles with fundraising compared to other top candidates, issues with his campaign's organizing ability, and \"lackluster\" performances from Biden at campaign stops in Iowa. While several Democratic leaders and officials echoed that the campaign is \"in trouble,\" many acknowledged that Biden has been able to hold on to his initial supporters.\u00a0 \u00a0 Biden repeatedly outpolls Mr. Trump in head-to-head matchups, including in pivotal states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. And a clear majority of Democratic voters say the ability to beat Mr. Trump is the single most important attribute a candidate can possess. Jesse Harris, Biden's senior Iowa adviser, said the campaign is looking to get Biden in front of as many Iowans as possible. In an attempt to reach a wider group of voters, Biden's team in Iowa is targeting not just previous caucus-goers and Democrats, but also independents and Republicans.\u00a0 Elsewhere in Iowa\u2026 Senator Bernie Sanders\u00a0opened eight new offices across the state this past weekend, according to the campaign. Sanders now has 22 offices and over 133 staffers on the ground, both among the most of any campaign in Iowa says\u00a0Bidar. The campaign also says it knocked on more than 11,000 doors in the last 48 hours, adding to the over 100,000 doors they have knocked since the launch of the campaign. This comes after Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned for Sanders in Iowa this month.\u00a0 Over the weekend, the Sanders campaign also launched a second digital ad featuring Ocasio-Cortez. \"We're building the largest grassroots movement of working class Iowans our state has ever seen,\" said Sander's Iowa Field Director Michael Fasullo in a statement. \"With these new offices, we're expanding our reach across the state and giving our supporters the tools they need to bring new folks into the political process and win the caucus in February.\"\u00a0 And\u00a0Senator Kamala Harris\u00a0announced Monday that she will be spending Thanksgiving with her family in Iowa.\u00a0Bidar\u00a0notes that Harris has spent four days in Iowa this month and is scheduled to spend five days in the Hawkeye state during the week of Thanksgiving. According to the latest\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker, Harris is polling at 5% in Iowa, tied for fifth place with Amy Klobuchar. Harris's campaign says they have knocked on more than 200,000 doors in Iowa since August. \"Day by day and door by door, we are continuing to grow our network of supporters, volunteers, and precinct leaders that form the heart of our campaign,\" said Iowa Organizing Director Erin Phillips.\u00a0 DEMOCRATS WIN IN LOUISIANA Democrat Governor John Bel Edwards\u00a0will be the first Democrat governor to win reelection\u00a0in Louisiana since 1975, after defeating Republican Eddie Rispone by just over one percent on Saturday. And after almost two days of no public acknowledgement from Mr. Trump's Twitter account, Edwards spokesperson Eric Holl told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0the president called to congratulate Edwards in private. At his election night watch party,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0reports Edwards only mentioned Trump briefly in his remarks: \"You didn't just vote for me, you voted for four more years of putting Louisiana first...And as for the president, God bless his heart.\"\u00a0 While Mr. Trump invested no small degree of political capital in the Louisiana and Kentucky only to watch Republicans come up short, neither deep-red state is expected to be competitive in 2020's presidential race. Still, national parties are looking for takeaways from Saturday's result. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a statement this weekend touting Edwards' emphasis on expanding Medicaid. \"Governor John Bel Edwards earned a second term by working to make health care more affordable and accessible for the people he serves in Louisiana...House Republicans are likely reconsidering just how eager they are to rubber stamp President Trump's reckless agenda in Washington,\" said DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos in a statement.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's decision to allow political lies and misinformation in a wide-ranging speech on Thursday in which he appealed to the virtues of debate and free expression.  Giving people a voice and enabling a vigorous exchange of ideas is good for society, Zuckerberg said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Thursday at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Case in point? The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which, according to the Facebook founder, happened at least in part because of a failure to consider diverse perspectives. \"Back when I was in college, our country had just gone to war in Iraq  and the mood on our campus was disbelief. A lot of people felt like we  were acting without hearing a lot of important perspectives,\" he said.  \"I remember feeling that if more people had a voice to share their  experiences, maybe things would have turned out differently.\" That realization shaped his vision for  Facebook, Zuckerberg said, describing the social media platform as something to \"give people  voice and bring people together.\" Zuckerberg studied at Harvard University from 2002 to 2004, dropping out  to run Facebook full-time after his project became popular off-campus. The U.S. led an invasion of Iraq in March 2003, based largely on  faulty claims that the country had weapons of mass destruction. The address comes after Facebook was criticized for allowing political ads that contain lies. The company recently ran an ad from the Trump reelection  campaign that accused former vice president Joe Biden of corruption. The accusation hasn't been proved, and the Biden campaign asked for the ad to be taken down. Facebook declined.\u00a0 Senator Elizabeth Warren last week took out her own campaign ad  claiming that Zuckerberg endorsed Trump, a way of criticizing the company's stance by using a political falsehood against it. (Both Biden and Warren are  running for the chance to challenge Mr. Trump as a Democrat in next  year's election.) Warren, who has been harshly critical of Facebook, doubled down after Zuckerberg's speech.  \"Mark Zuckerberg's speech today shows how little he learned from 2016, and how unprepared Facebook is to handle the 2020 election,\" Warren said in a series of tweets. \"Here's the thing, Mark. Trump isn't just posting a lie on his own page for his own followers. Facebook is accepting millions of dollars from Trump to run political ads, including ones with misinformation and outright lies. Ads that TV stations won't even run,\" she said. \"Facebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again\u2014and profit off of it.\" On Thursday, Zuckerberg revealed that Facebook had considered dropping political ads altogether, given that \"the controversy certainly isn't worth the  small part of  our business they make up.\" But the company concluded  that such a ban  would be tantamount to censorship. \"I  know many people disagree, but in general I don't think it's right  for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,\"  he said, adding that other major tech platforms have also run these  misleading ads.  \"There are many more ads about issues than there  are directly about elections,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Would we ban all ads  about health care or immigration or women's empowerment? If we banned  candidates' ads but not these, would that really make sense to give  everyone else a voice in political debates except the candidates  themselves?\" Zuckerberg also drew on the work of Martin Luther King, Jr., protests  against the Vietnam War and the persecution of socialist leader Eugene  Debs in arguing for a minimum of censorship on the social network. \"The  long journey  towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that  challenge us,\" Zuckerberg said. \"You  can't impose tolerance top-down .  ... It has to come from people  opening up, sharing experiences and  developing a shared story for  society that we all feel we're a part of.  That's how we make progress.\" Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King, Jr., took issue with Zuckerberg's assessment. \"I'd like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,\" she said on Twitter. \"These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\" Facebook has been taking small steps toward moderating the billions of posts that it hosts every day, and is forming an oversight board to help it with difficult content decisions. The board, which is expected to be made up of 40 members, plans to start hearing appeal cases next year.",

            "article_content": "The Census Bureau is enlisting major tech companies as it prepares for a campaign to combat disinformation and false news in the run-up to the 2020 census. The bureau has approached Google, Facebook and Twitter to stave off rogue actors. It's also working with Google, Microsoft and other tech companies to improve the census' visibility online, the agency told CBS News. \"The 2016 election was kind of a wake-up call. Our partners at Homeland Security are saying in 2020 they're concerned about the census and the election,\" said Ron Jarmin, deputy director of the Census Bureau.  The results of the once-in-a-decade count determine political representation and distribution of nearly $700 billion in federal funds every year. (While the Census Bureau conducts many surveys based on sampling, the decennial census is the only program to actually count all U.S. residents.)  Certain groups of people \u2014 including black and Hispanic residents, Native Americans on reservations, renters and poor people \u2014 have been underrepresented in prior counts, while homeowners and white residents were overcounted. The Trump administration's attempt to add a last-minute citizenship question to the census further creates confusion, setting the stage for potential disinformation campaigns, such as misleading ads or straight-up false news stories.  \"We're concerned about people seeing messages, like if they search on April 2, that if you didn't fill out your census, it's too late. We're trying to make sure that when people search they get correct information,\" said Jarmin.\u00a0 Other fake messages could tell people that in filing a tax return, their census reply was also filled out automatically (not true) or that information the census collects on residents could be shared with immigration or finance authorities. (The census bureau is bound by law to keep information confidential, in the interest of getting the most accurate count possible.) Add that to Americans' growing distrust of government institutions, and the potential undercount could be staggering, said academics and civil rights advocates, shifting political power and access to federal funds for a decade. Already, online discussion forums on places like 4chan are showing conversations about disrupting the count from both U.S. and foreign actors, according to Reuters. Jarmin referenced research from Data & Society that shows discussions to disrupt are taking place. \u00a0 The Census Bureau doesn't expect to see concrete efforts to interfere with the census until the count is under way, Jarmin said. But he could conceive of a situation in which, like in the 2016 elections, certain demographic or ideological groups are targeted, he said.  The bureau is asking Google, Twitter, Facebook and other online platforms for \"search bar optimization,\" to help steer inquiries about the census to accurate content, Jarmin said. It will run a campaign amplifying positive messages about the census, in cooperation with about 300,000 partners \u2014 community, church and business groups. And it will ask platforms to aggressively take down false news and delete accounts that spread spoofs or lies. \"Overall, misinformation is not really a new issue,\" said Stephen Buckner, a Census Bureau spokesperson. \"Because of the digital channels and how we share information globally now, it allows for spread of misinformation much quicker. Something could get out of hand really quickly if you're not prepared to address misinformation quickly.\"",

            "article_content": "Veteran Wisconsin Republican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner announced his retirement from Congress on Wednesday, making the former House Judiciary Committee chairman the 15th GOP lawmaker to say he will step aside before next year's elections. Sensenbrenner, 76, was first elected in 1978 and is the second-longest serving current member of the House, trailing only Alaska Republican Don Young in seniority. Sensenbrenner said in a statement that when he first began public service, \"I said I would know when it was time to step back\" and that he'd decided now was that time. Two other House members also announced Wednesday they would not seek reelection next year: Bill Flores, Republican of Texas, and Susan Davis, Democrat of California. The spate of House Republican retirements puts them ahead of their pace during the 2018 election cycle, when 34 did not run for re-election. That was the party's highest number of retirements since at least 1930. Sensenbrenner's district, which includes parts of Milwaukee's suburbs, is considered safe Republican terrain. Even so, his departure adds to a parade of GOP lawmakers who will not be back, including at least four seats that Democrats have a legitimate shot at capturing, and will\u00a0complicate Republican efforts to win back the chamber's majority. Democrats control the House 235-197, with one independent and two vacancies in North Carolina that are scheduled to be filled in special elections next week. Sensenbrenner was a chief author of the USA Patriot Act, an anti-terrorism measure enacted in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001. A combative conservative, he has championed immigration restrictions, including curbing asylum and barring immigrants in the country illegally from obtaining driver's licenses. In 2015, he wrote legislation restricting the Patriot Act by limiting federal gathering of some data on individuals. Sensenbrenner is a descendent of the founder of Kimberly-Clark, the company credited with inventing the sanitary napkin. Financially comfortable since birth, he also won at least one District of Columbia lottery, for $250,000. In his statement, Sensenbrenner said he's cast 23,882 House votes and sponsored or co-sponsored 4,299 pieces of legislation, of which 217 were signed into law by six different presidents. Davis' and Flores' districts are both considered safe for their parties. Davis, a 10-term veteran, has worked on education and military issues. She became the fourth Democrat to say this year that they won't run again in 2020. Flores, who once led the conservative Republican Study Committee, has served five terms and said he'd always committed to serving fewer than six. Besides the 15 GOP retirees, a 16th \u2014 Representative Tom Marino of Pennsylvania \u2014 quit Congress early this year and has already been replaced by another Republican.",

            "article_content": "The Nevada caucuses, which are the third presidential Democratic nominating contest, are less than six months away, and Democratic presidential candidates are ramping up efforts to court a mammoth Las Vegas labor union that has played an important role in the caucus outcome in the past.\u00a0 Claiming to be\u00a0\"one of the strongest political forces in the state,\" the Culinary Union has\u00a0only rarely shied away\u00a0from wielding its influence in Nevada. Its 60,000 members work at the heart of the state's economy: the gaming and tourism industry.\u00a0 With what is currently the largest primary field in recent history, a split outcome in the first two contests in Iowa and New Hampshire would leave a big opening for a presidential hopeful in Nevada. The union's endorsement in the 2008 caucuses \u2014 Nevada's first as an early deciding contest \u2014 \u00a0was seen as a pivotal boost for then-candidate Barack Obama,\u00a0though insufficient\u00a0to deliver a majority of the state's precincts. Still, while Clinton won the state, Obama took more delegates because of the way Nevada apportions them. \"We were the first union who endorsed President Obama, and we feel proud about that,\" Geoconda Arguello-Kline, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union   told CBS News. In 2016, the union sat out the contest amid a pitched battle in the state between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 This year, the labor heavyweight has not ruled out a 2020 endorsement and will be looking a number of issues, including wages, healthcare, and immigration. But there is also another factor that might hold some sway in the union's decision: the Culinary Union's years-long fight with Station Casinos, a local casino and hotel chain.\u00a0 The Culinary Union has accused Station Casinos of ignoring successful elections to unionize at several of its twenty locations and stalling talks at some properties through costly court appeals. It also\u00a0points to past accusations\u00a0that workers were harassed and retaliated against over their labor organizing. \"Right now, the Station Casinos are sending the message that they don't respect the democratic process,\" said Arguello-Kline. In May, the National Labor Relations Board, which is now under Republican control, ruled against Station Casinos for its \"unlawful failure and refusal to recognize and bargain with the union\" at the Palms. Station Casinos\u00a0is appealing the decision. \"[O]ur challenges are both legal and appropriate,\" Michael Britt, senior vice president of government relations and corporate communications for the company, told CBS News in a statement. The campaigns of Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014\u00a0have all voiced solidarity\u00a0with the Culinary Union in its fight, calling on Station Casinos management to negotiate with the union.\u00a0 Staff for Booker, Buttigieg, Castro, Harris, Klobuchar, and Sanders have also told CBS News that their campaigns have steered clear of\u00a0all Station Casinos properties\u00a0in Las Vegas, which has no shortage of hotels. These campaigns also say they have received no donations from the\u00a0company's leadership.\u00a0 \"It's time for the Palms' billionaire, Trump-supporting owners to stop ignoring the law and start negotiating with their workers,\" Sanders\u00a0posted in August.\u00a0 And as the Culinary Union's distinctive red shirts \u2014 some reading \"WE VOTE WE WIN\" \u2014 have turned up at a number of candidates' campaign stops, organizers from a number of campaigns\u00a0have turned out\u00a0for the union's high-profile demonstrations outside Station Casinos properties. Here, Gabe Uy, the political director for Harris' campaign in Nevada, tweeted from one protest: Marching in solidarity with @Culinary226 workers! #ContractNow pic.twitter.com/vQL8WWSvL3 But a handful of candidates who say they stand with the Culinary Union may have also run afoul of the group, CBS News has learned, by patronizing a Station Casinos property or accepting money from one of its executives.   Federal election filings reveal that Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign, which had vowed to \"stand with the Palms workers\" as early\u00a0as March, has repeatedly crossed the picket line at the Palms Casino Resort, which is in the crosshairs of\u00a0the union's boycott, with stays\u00a0in May\u00a0and\u00a0June. Candidate Marianne Williamson also stayed at the Palms\u00a0in May.\u00a0 A Warren campaign spokesperson told CBS News that the incident in question involved two advance staff members and claimed that there was no picket line. The spokesperson says the campaign apologized to the Culinary Union \"weeks ago when we realized it.\" \"Keep the pressure on. Shoulder-to-shoulder, I'm in this fight with you and the Culinary Union all the way,\" Warren had said in a video\u00a0posted last week. In a statement to CBS News, Williamson reiterated her support for labor unions, citing \"travel and scheduling restrictions\" for the booking. \"We were relegated to visiting the Palms Casino and Resort, where we had a terrific experience in large part to the pro-union staff,\" writes Williamson, adding that she urges the company to \"set an example of social responsibility in business.\" \"If you stay in these places, you don't respect these workers when they work through a democratic process,\" Geoconda Arguello-Kline, Secretary-Treasurer for the Culinary Union, tells CBS News. \"We believe that candidates saying they are fighting for the working class, they are not going to be at the Station Casinos,\" she added later. As Sanders has noted, the company's owners\u00a0are frequent donors to the president and Republican causes. But at least one board member, Dr. James Nave,\u00a0has also given generously\u00a0to several Democrats, including\u00a0a $5,600 donation\u00a0to Joe Biden's campaign, which has\u00a0heavily outraised rivals\u00a0in southern Nevada.\u00a0 Arguello-Kline called on all Democrats to return donations from Station Casinos executives. \"I think anybody who receives donations from an anti-union company, a union-busting company, that doesn't respect the democratic process. They have to return that money,\" said Arguello-Kline.\u00a0 \"We're proud of all the contributions we've received in Nevada \u2014 95 percent of which were 200 dollars or less,\" Vedant Patel, communications director for Biden's campaign in Nevada, told CBS News, declining to comment on specific donations. He also said that Biden \"has long been a champion for organized labor.\" CBS News reporter covering public health and the pandemic.",

            "article_content": "Democrats are welcoming a wide variety of potential challengers to President Trump's 2020 re-election bid \u2014 with the exception of one. In an interview\u00a0Sunday with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" Starbucks' former CEO Howard Schultz announced he is seriously considering a bid as an \"centrist\" independent. \"I've been a lifelong Democrat. We look at both parties, we see extremes on both sides,\" Schultz told Scott Pelley. \"The American people are exhausted. Their trust has been broken. And they are looking for a better choice,\" he said. But what Schultz may see as a \"better choice,\" Democrats see as a bad idea. Party members wasted no time in discouraging him from moving forward with a campaign, fearing a liberal independent bid would draw away votes from the eventual party nominee and work to Mr. Trump's advantage.  \"I have a concern that, if he did run, that, essentially, it would provide Donald Trump with his best hope of getting reelected,\" 2020 hopeful Juli\u00e1n Castro told CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. \"I would suggest to Mr. Schultz to truly think about the negative impact that that might make.\" Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, put it more bluntly: \"If he enters the race, I will start a Starbucks boycott because I'm not giving a penny that will end up in the election coffers of a guy who will help Trump win.\"  The chance to defeat Mr. Trump has become an organizing principle of the Democratic Party, and party primary and caucus voters are putting a premium on electability as they assess the candidates.  \"If you don't want Donald Trump re-elected, you should be ready to unite behind the Democratic nominee as the best antidote,\" says Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson, who was a spokesman for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. \"In the end, the American people won't take kindly to a billionaire who thinks his money entitles him to this kind of vanity experiment. People may not like the two party system, but they like a party of one even less.\" Independent bids haven't been successful in presidential politics, and they're often seen as spoilers; The candidacies of Ross Perot in 1992 and Ralph Nader in 2000 are among the infamous examples of independent or third party bids influencing the outcome of the overall contest. And many Democrats were outraged by the candidacy of Jill Stein in 2016. When New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg declined to make an independent bid in 2016, he argued that his candidacy could lead to the election of Donald Trump. \"That is not a risk I can take in good conscience,\" he wrote in an op-ed at the time.  Democrats have been supportive of an independent bid by a Republican \u2014 for one, John Kasich said to be weighing an independent run \u2014 as it would siphon votes from Mr. Trump. But Schultz is the first Democrat to weigh a bid outside the party. And his personal wealth and resources would allow him to remain in the running for as long as he'd like to stay in the race. Schultz demurred when asked whether his entrance would be damaging for Democrats. \"I want to see the American people win,\" he said. \"I will be an independent person who will embrace those ideas because I'm not in any way in bed with a party.\"  Schultz has been a frequent and loud critic of Mr. Trump, and had used his position as CEO of Starbucks as a platform to weigh in on cultural debates. In his \"60 Minutes\" interview, he agreed with many Democratic Party positions, including on immigration and climate change. And on the foreign policy front, he said it was not in the country's interest to pick fights with allies. \"We are much better as a country being part of the world order,\" he said.  But he disagrees with a push within the party for a \"Medicare-for-All\" approach to health care coverage, arguing that \"what the Democrats are proposing is something that is as false as the wall. And that is free health care for all, which the country cannot afford.\" Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "President Trump's visit to a Shell natural gas plant in rural western Pennsylvania on Tuesday was an official White House event, but that might not have been readily apparent to those listening to his speech. Addressing workers at the yet-to-be-completed plant in Monaca, Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump reminisced about the margins of his 2016 victory in the county, predicted the states he would win again, touted his administration's immigration policies, attacked the \"fake news\" media and blasted his political foes. The president even explicitly urged workers, hundreds of whom were gathered for his speech, to vote for him. \"In 2020, we're running, so you'd better get out there and make sure we win,\" the president said in his speech, which ran more than an hour and was supposed to focus on American energy dominance and manufacturing. The line between the president's political events and official events are often blurred as the presidential election nears and Mr. Trump, who filed for reelection the day he was sworn into office, travels to states that are key to his victory. Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump's campaign officials and political analysts recognize, is pivotal to his successful reelection \u2014 Tuesday marked his 13th visit to the state since taking office. At the event, the president bashed his predecessors and faulted former vice president Joe Biden, his potential Democratic rival, for the nation's struggles. He also took one of his typical swipes at Elizabeth Warren, or \"Pocahontas,\" as the president calls the Massachusetts senator who once claimed native American heritage. Biden and Warren are among the top contenders in the polls. \"We'll have to hit Pocahontas again if she does win,\" Mr. Trump told the Pennsylvania crowd, adding soon thereafter, \"What a group, Pocahontas and Sleepy Joe.\" The president insisted he's a big supporter of unions, and said he wants union members to be sure to tell their leaders, \"I hope you're going to support Trump.\" \"And if they don't, vote them the hell out of office,\" said the president, who also managed to slip in \"Make America Great Again\" and \"Keep America Great\" lines in his 67-minute speech. He also joked about serving more than two terms. \"Can you imagine if I got a fair press? I mean, we're leading without it,\" the president said. \"Can you imagine if these people treated me fairly? The election would be over. Have they ever called off an election before? Just said, 'Look, let's go, four more years.' Yeah. And then you want to really drive them crazy, go to 'hashtag, third term, hashtag, fourth term,' you'll drive them totally crazy.\" Mr. Trump did spend significant chunks of his speech touting his administration's approach to manufacturing and harnessing American energy, ostensibly the reason for his visit. Mr. Trump won Pennsylvania by less than 1 percentage point in 2016, although his victory was much more decisive in Beaver County, where he was Tuesday. House Administration Committee Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren has demanded the White House and Trump campaign provide information about how the president's travel is financed. The president does have latitude to travel on the taxpayers' dime for official purposes and, unlike his White House staffers, is not subject to the Hatch Act prohibiting political speech by federal employees. \"The president frequently mixes official travel with campaign-related political purposes, which raises questions about whether American taxpayers are footing the bill for political travel that should be paid for by his campaign,\" Lofgren wrote in a May\u00a0letter\u00a0to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.

            "article_content": "If you're plugged into the Democratic presidential nomination contest, especially on social media, you've probably been hearing quite a bit about progressive ideas like a Green New Deal and Medicare for All. The first presidential debates of the cycle featured a diverse array of candidates vowing to fight for sweeping liberal policies on health care, immigration, and student debt.\u00a0  Some of the unabashedly progressive platforms on display have prompted concern about alienating moderate voters next year. What do Democratic voters think about these kinds of policies, and just how liberal are these voters?  As part of the CBS News 2020 Battleground Tracker, we polled registered voters last month across the states with early nominating contests that were scheduled up to and including Super Tuesday. Our sample has 7,885 Democrats and independents who lean toward to the Democratic Party (whom we'll refer to as Democrats here for the sake of brevity). With ideological fissures within the party coming to the fore, we took a moment to explore the ideological divisions among Democratic voters in these early states.  When we ask Democrats to describe their general political viewpoint, they divide roughly equally into three groups:\u00a0  There are demographic differences between the groups. The very liberal tend to be whiter, younger, and more educated than the other groups, while the moderate/conservative group is primarily non-white (including 29% black and 19% Hispanic), as well as being older and more religious.  Very liberal Democrats are the most engaged at this point in the campaign. They are the most likely to say that they are paying a lot of attention to the 2020 candidates and that they are very likely to vote in their state's primary or caucus next year. This group is also the most politically active online, with three in four telling us they have posted political content on social media, as opposed to just half of voters in the moderate/conservative group.  When it comes to political attitudes, there is much these groups agree on. They strongly disapprove of President Trump and want an \"authentic\" nominee capable of beating him in 2020. Each group says their top election issue is health care, and they want to hear candidates talk about lowering its costs.  At the same time, Democrats are by no means monolithic: the different wings of the party prioritize different issues and candidate qualities. When it comes to issues they want to hear about from the candidates, the most liberal Democrats place greater emphasis on stewardship of the environment, such as reducing global warming and developing renewable energy sources. They also say that to earn their vote, candidates must address protecting immigrants and their families, abortion rights, and issues of race and gender. Moderate and conservative Democrats, on the other hand, place relatively greater importance on job creation and lowering taxes. The somewhat liberal group tends to fall in the middle on these issues.  When it comes to candidate traits, very liberal Democrats prioritize refusing money from big donors, while moderates and conservatives place relatively more importance on executive experience and a shared economic upbringing. Nearly half of very liberal Democrats (49%) say that to earn their support, it's extremely important that a candidate convince them that they have new policy ideas. Moderates and conservatives, by contrast, want to be convinced that a candidate can keep the country safe \u2013 six in ten say this is extremely important.  The liberal and moderate wings of the party also have slightly different preferences about candidates' demographic traits. Across groups, most say a candidate's gender and race do not matter to them, but among Democrats who express a preference, the very liberal are the most likely to express a desire for a woman and for a person of color. Among moderates and conservatives, slightly more voters express a preference for a man than for a woman. The somewhat liberal are closer to the very liberal in this respect.  When it comes to the Democratic Party's messaging in 2020, most very liberal Democrats prefer the party to run on advancing \"a more progressive agenda than the country had under Barack Obama\" (66%). Moderates and conservatives prefer the message to be a return to normalcy, specifically to \"return the country to the way it was before Donald Trump took office\" (56%). Somewhat liberal Democrats are evenly split between these two messages.\u00a0  When it comes to impeachment, the very liberal are the most likely group to say they want to hear candidates talk about impeaching Donald Trump right now, though across all three groups, the more popular position is to focus on beating him in the 2020 election instead.  These group differences in priorities translate to distinct vote preferences. (It's possible that voters' candidate preferences cause them to prioritize particular demographic traits or issues, and vice versa.) According to our latest estimates in June, the top choice among the most liberal group is Elizabeth Warren, who has run on a progressive platform and impeaching the president. The main reason voters select for considering Warren is her policy stances -- nine in ten of those considering her say this is a reason why.\u00a0  Joe Biden was named the top choice among pluralities of both the somewhat liberal and moderate/conservative groups. The main reason given for considering Biden is his time as President Obama's vice president.  This analysis is mainly based on a CBS News/YouGov survey fielded between May 31 and June 12, 2019. A representative sample of 16,624 registered voters was selected in 18 states that were expected to hold early primaries and caucuses: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia. (Georgia's primary has since been rescheduled.) This sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the American Community Survey, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, as well as 2016 presidential vote. The sample includes 7,885 self-identi\ufb01ed Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents, many of whom were previously interviewed online in a CBS News/YouGov survey fielded between April 25 and May 6, 2019 and weighted the same way. The previous survey was used to measure presidential approval and attitudes toward renewable energy sources.  Kabir Khanna is Deputy Director, Elections & Data Analytics at CBS News.

Elizabeth Warren spokesperson Ashley Woolheater says Warren, a Senate Armed Services Committee member, was unaware of domestic violence incidents in Patrick Shanahan's family when she voted against his nomination for deputy defense secretary in 2017, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. This supports Sen. Richard Blumenthal's claim that the committee was not informed of the incidents, which led Shanahan to withdraw from consideration to become defense secretary. \"This raises serious questions about how this administration is conducting its vetting processes and needs to be investigated,\" Warren said in a statement. BOOKER TO TESTIFY ON REPARATIONS:\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman reports New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u00a0is scheduled to\u00a0testify Wednesday\u00a0before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties to discuss a bill proposed by Rep. Sheila Jackson lee that would establish a commission to study and recommend proposals for paying reparations to the descendants of slaves. Booker introduced the Senate version of Jackson Lee's bill in April. In prepared remarks provided to CBS News, Booker is poised to say: \"It's time we seriously examine our collective history, and begin to develop proposals to right these historical wrongs and balance the scales of economic justice.\" COUNTER-PROGRAMMING IN FLORIDA: A Democratic rally on LGBTQ+ rights, immigration, Puerto Rico, gun violence and abortion access is planned for this evening a few blocks away from Mr. Trump's reelection rally in Orlando. Pulse nightclub survivor Brandon Wolf is one of the community organizers of the rally and told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson that even though the Florida Democratic Party promoted the event on their press call Tuesday morning, the event is not officially organized by the committee. Wolf said the rally organizers are even busing in folks from across Florida to attend, with the farthest bus coming from Miami-Dade County. The formal rally will run from 6 to 7 p.m. and feature several women speaking about their choice to have an abortion.\u00a0 BERNIE HOLDS REDDIT AMA:\u00a0Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders held a Reddit AMA (\"Ask Me Anything\") this afternoon on the subreddit r/SandersForPresident, a community of more than 252,000 members. The Sanders campaign announced the AMA an hour before the senator began answering questions. In that time, there were about 3,900 comments and 50,000 people tuned into a live stream, according to the Sanders campaign.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0reports that the campaign was overwhelmed by the response. At the time of this writing, Sanders answered 10 questions, ranging in topic from climate change, to democratic socialism, to healthcare. A word cloud of the responses can be seen below. Some words that stood out most frequently:\u00a0 president, energy, prescription, drugs, entitled. KLOBUCHAR'S FIRST 100 DAYS?\u00a0In an effort to help Democrats picture what\u00a0Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u00a0may do from the Oval Office, the Minnesota senator released a 17-page plan of bullet points this morning on what the first 100 days of a potential Klobuchar administration would involve, per\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. Highlights include: BIDEN VISITS STONEWALL:\u00a0While in New York City on a fundraising swing, former Vice President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to the Stonewall Inn in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots,\u00a0Erickson\u00a0reports. When Biden appeared behind the bar, one afternoon attendee shouted, \"Hey Joe, can I have a beer?\" according to the candidate's Instagram Story. At the end of the video, Biden gave a serious pitch for continued progress for LGBT rights: \"The American people are way ahead \u2014 way ahead \u2014 of the where the political forces are. The idea you can walk \u2014 you can get married one day, now that it's a constitutional right, which we knew it was all along, and the next day walk into your home state and get fired because you are LGBT \u2014 wrong. It's gotta change.\" SECOND TIME'S A CHARM?\u00a0Montana Gov. Steve Bullock\u00a0announced he has qualified for the second DNC debate in Detroit next month. But during the first debate next week, which he did not qualify for, Bullock plans to hold two televised town halls, as\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0reported this morning.\u00a0 On Wednesday, June 26, the first night of the debate, Bullock will instead appear at a town hall in Iowa broadcast by WHO-DT, an NBC affiliate in Des Moines. On June 27, night two, he will make his case at a New Hampshire town hall airing on WMUR, an ABC affiliate in Manchester. NEW CASTRO HOUSING PLAN: Today former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro unveiled part two of his \"People First Housing Plan,\" per\u00a0Perry. Part two focuses on housing discrimination and Castro says he will reinstitute the Fair Housing Rule, prevent displacement of residents from the impacts of gentrification, and establish a $200 billion Green Infrastructure Fund to \"bridge the $2 trillion infrastructure gap in the United States. Additionally, Castro went on MSNBC to respond to news of Shanahan withdrawing his nomination to be defense secretary. Castro said of the number of vacancies within the administration: \"We're not able to be as well represented or as strong as we could be as a country in our diplomatic efforts,\" and added, \"it has been total chaos.\" IN THE MIDDLE: The chairs of the Iowa and New Hampshire Democratic Parties held a call today to discuss Mr. Trump's reelection announcement, per\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. On the call, Iowa Chair Troy Price said the party needs to focus on economic issues and health care to win back some of the Obama/Trump voters in the Hawkeye State. Further, he said Democrats need to have a good rural message, such as promoting health care coverage in rural areas and improving infrastructure. Price also said the party will combat Mr. Trump's message by talking to voters on the ground, adding that was something Democrats didn't do well in the lead up to 2016. He said the party needs to rebuild relationships and trust with voters they lost. Ray Buckley, the New Hampshire party chair, pointed to a significant increase in turnout and said the party honed a lot of skills during the 2018 cycle that they'll be using going into 2020. At a round table hosted by nonpartisan think tank New America on how work-family issues will shape the 2020 election, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren were lauded for having the most comprehensive plans relating to issues like paid family leave and childcare policy,\u00a0CBS News Political Unit intern Julia Cherner\u00a0reports. Emily Martin of the National Women's Law Center noted that Harris' Equal Pay Plan includes pay transparency, which allows for greater potential to close the gender and race pay gap. Katie Hamm of the Center for American Progress said that Warren has been \"front and center\" on the issue of early childhood education on the campaign trail. The discussion featured experts from over a dozen different organizations, including the Institute for Women's Policy Research and the American Enterprise Institute.",

            "article_content": "Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have proposed sweeping gun control legislation. Elizabeth Warren quoted from the Gospel of Matthew during a televised town hall. Pete Buttigieg appeared on the cover of Time magazine with his husband, and has said their relationship brought him \"closer to God.\" In the 2020 presidential primary, candidates are embracing topics that were once considered taboo in politics, and liabilities for the party in a general election. But significant shifts in public opinion combined with rhetoric and policy in the Trump administration have Democrats eager to talk about so-called social issues on the campaign trail. \"The Trump presidency has really put values front and center,\" says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. \"There really is a fight for the soul of the nation in Democrats' minds.\" Democrats say that the significant shifts in public attitudes, particularly on guns and marriage, allow the party to play offense on these issues. \"These are not the third rail issues that they once were and Democrats are now comfortable proactively discussing these topics as voting issues,\" says Democratic strategist Joel Payne. \"LGBT rights and gun control are no longer the 'toxic' culture war issues for Republicans to exploit Democrats with \u2014  Republicans lost the high ground on these issues with voters.\" In 2012, Vice President Joe Biden went off script to voice support for same sex marriage, getting out ahead of President Obama who had not yet gone that far. Seven years later, Buttigieg kissed his husband on stage after announcing his candidacy for president. In April, a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 68 percent of Americans were fine with a gay president. In an interview Thursday with Fox News, Mr. Trump said it was \"great\" to see a gay candidate share the stage with his husband. \"It's something that perhaps some people will have a problem with it,\" he said. \"I have no problem with it whatsoever. I think it's good.\" In February, a year after the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, a CBS News poll found that 56 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be more strict, including 51 percent of independents. Most of the 2020 Democratic candidates support a ban or restrictions on assault-style weapons. Even Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who entered the race this week, said he would support a ban on some semi-automatic weapons. And Harris and Booker have released policy proposals that would restrict gun ownership. \"The politics have fundamentally changed,\" Peter Ambler, executive director of the gun control advocacy group Giffords, told CBS last month. \"It's become a threshold, litmus test issue for Democrats.\" While the issues haven't changed dramatically for Democrats since 2016, party strategists say the difference is that they may be less of a liability in the general election than before. \"It shows more how the American people have evolved,\" says former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who is supporting Biden in the primary. \"Anyone who was going to vote against Pete for kissing his partner wasn't going to vote for a Democrat anyway.\" \"There's not danger on the social issues,\" Rendell said. \"The only thing we have to worry about is over promising, so that the Republicans can say they [Democrats] are turning this country socialist and causing taxes to go up.\" As much as Democrats are becoming more comfortable addressing cultural issues on the campaign trail, party strategists also urge caution. \"The one challenge is that the biggest deficit they have is not on these kinds of issues but on economics,\" says Lake. Democrats \"have to make sure that having this conversation does not get in the way of providing an economic alternative.\" Republicans have been quick to criticize the Democrats' gun policies this cycle, a signal that the issue is still politically fraught. If guns and gay rights have a particular rallying effect among the base of the party, Democrats say that in talking about religion and faith, candidates have an opportunity to reach voters outside their traditional constituency \u2014 particularly by drawing a contrast to Mr. Trump on immigration policy and climate change. \"It's about making sure you're in the best position to make sure Trump doesn't get reelected and an essential piece of that is having a candidate who can reach the diverse faith communities to recapture the losses we saw,\" says Michael Wear, who directed faith outreach for the Obama campaign. \"If Democrats win in 2020, the president is going to have a responsible to bring this country together, to heal from the immortality, and that's going to require the faith community.\" Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, has been among the most outspoken about his faith on the campaign trail. In a televised town hall earlier this year that helped to catapult him to the national stage, Buttigieg called Vice President Mike Pence a \"cheerleader for the porn star presidency.\" When asked about faith and politics in another town hall last month, Buttigieg said \"part of where I'm coming from is a faith tradition that counsels me to be as humble as possible, that counsels me to look after those who need defending. And frankly, it couldn't be more radically different than what I see certainly in this White House.\" Warren said that faith guided her political views. In a televised town hall in April, she quoted scripture. \"And the shepherd, the Lord, answers back by saying, 'I was hungry, and you gave me food. I was thirsty, and you gave me water,'\" she said. \"And what I hear in that is two things that guide me every day...there is God, there is value in every single human being.\" Booker, a New Jersey senator, has often quoted scripture on the campaign trail. In a CNN town hall last month, Booker quoted both the Torah and the Bible. \"Christ is the center of my life,\" he said. \"I believe that the Bible talks more about poverty, about greeting the stranger, about being there for the convicted far more than it talks about the kind of toxic stuff you often hear the president spewing out there. And our immigration policy violates not only American values, but the values of our faith traditions.\" And Joe Biden, a Catholic, has cast the 2020 campaign as \"the battle for the soul of our nation.\" Religion and faith \"may play an even larger role this cycle given the outsized importance of the African-American vote, especially in the South, and the centrality of faith to many older black voters who will be critical to determining the next Democratic nominee,\" says Payne, the Democratic strategist.\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "As the 2020 presidential election approaches, candidates and their supporters are turning to digital advertisers to reach their key audiences. According to a recent report by Axios, the biggest spenders so far are President Trump's campaign and billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer.  But what you see on platforms like Facebook will likely differ from the topics covered in town halls and debates. Axios reporter Sara Fischer told CBSN the biggest issues are ones that are \"emotionally driven,\" like gun control and abortion, which are more likely to resonate on social media.  For example, on the Republican side, Axios found 44 percent of Mr. Trump's Facebook ad budget is being used to target users over 65, which aligns with his key demographic of supporters. His campaign is also likely to focus on immigration. Democrats, on the other hand, are only spending 27 percent of their budget to reach seniors. As the Democratic field gets more crowded, digital ad spending will be key to soliciting donations. Under rules established by the Democratic National Committee, candidates wishing to participate in the initial primary debates must have donations from at least 65,000 people and 200 unique donors from at least 20 states. \"When you're clicking around on your phone or online, it's really easy to just go into a portal where you can send a donation,\" Fisher said. \"That's why you see all these candidates on the Democratic side rushing to spend money online.\" As the primaries get closer, Fisher said candidates will take out \"homepage takeovers\" in which they buy out the homepages of big news sites like The New York Times or The Washington Post. But she warns some of the biggest platforms, like Google and Facebook, don't have vigorous fact checking procedures for evaluating the political ads you see.  \"Bad actors, people trying to manipulate the system, they know how the algorithms work,\" she said. \"So what they'll do is they'll put up something that's inaccurate, or misinformation that's just bad enough, but good enough so that the algorithm won't boot it off the platform.\" The same emotion that helps candidates connect with voters is what Russia\u00a0relied on during the 2016 election, when Russian intelligence operatives posed as Americans to establish social media personas and pages and used specific language designed to deepen divisions.

            "article_content": "Democrats are unsurprisingly livid with New Jersey Representative Jeff Van Drew, who is reportedly planning to defect to the Republican Party. At least six of his aides resigned by Monday morning, and some said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that Van Drew's plan \"to join the ranks of the Republican Party led by Donald Trump does not align with the values we brought to this job when we joined his office.\"\u00a0 Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos tweeted out an invitation for these staffers to work with the Democratic House campaign arm. \"It's right before the holidays and these staffers just quit their jobs to stand up for their Democratic values. We'll bring them and others who leave on with the\u00a0@dccc\u00a0until they land new jobs that align with their values.\" Van Drew, a freshman congressman from a Republican-leaning southern New Jersey district, could have faced a tough primary had he remained a Democrat. His internal polling from earlier this month showed that 60 percent of likely Democratic primary voters wanted someone new to replace him, and that 71 percent would be less likely to support him if he voted against impeaching President Trump. Van Drew was one of only two Democrats to vote against holding an impeachment inquiry.\u00a0 Although no Democrat had announced a challenge to Van Drew his party switch was reported in the press, college professor Brigid Callahan Harrison did so Monday. \"Jeff Van Drew has betrayed our trust. His actions show that he is not working for South Jersey.

Mr. Trump won this district by 5 points in 2016, and it's one of 31 districts he won that Democratic House members are currently representing.\u00a0 Many of these swing-state Democrats announced they'd be voting in favor of the impeachment articles this week. But\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0said at least 10 of the 31 Democrats in Trump districts have not yet taken a firm stand on impeachment.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN Democrats have spent months defending Joe Biden from allegations that his son, Hunter Biden, improperly benefited from his father's time as vice president when he accepted a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. At recent events, the only mention of this saga would sometimes be from Biden himself, who proactively addressed the issue and said the president's \"lies\" about his family were evidence that he was the Democratic candidate whom the White House most feared.\u00a0 But\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0says this topic has re-emerged as a flash point at Biden's recent campaign events, providing moments of chaos and distraction. At his first campaign rally in Texas on Friday, Biden was heckled mid-speech by a man shouting about \"Ukraine.\" The San Antonio crowd quickly chanted \"We want Joe!\" and Biden shouted back, \"This man represents Donald Trump very well.\" While Biden tried to get the crowd's attention back to his immigration-focused speech, the heckler continued until a security officer arrived. \"Let the man go!\" Biden commanded, \"This isn't a Trump rally,\" apparently referring to the sometimes-aggressive tactics used against hecklers at Mr. Trump's past events.\u00a0 On the rope line after his speech awaited another small contingent of additional protestors\u2014several wearing \"Latinos for Trump\" gear\u2014who held signs about Ukraine and screamed while Biden took selfies with attendees. The scene was loud, chaotic and distracting for Biden as he looked to greet supporters while dodging hecklers.\u00a0 The scene came two weeks after an Iowa man confronted Biden about Ukraine and alleged that he had installed Hunter Biden at the energy company. An agitated Biden, wanting to shut down the back-and-forth, dismissed the questioner as a \"damn liar.\"\u00a0 PETE BUTTIGIEG South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg released a\u00a0plan\u00a0Monday morning that his campaign said is aimed at empowering the Latino community by reversing President Trump's administration policies and dismantling the \"institutional barriers that have kept Latinos from feeling like they fully belong in their country.\"\u00a0 In a statement, Buttigieg said, \"The Latino community is an integral force in pushing our nation toward achieving inclusive, progressive ideals. In so many ways, members of the Latino community uphold and embody the values that make us American\u2026Despite these contributions, Latinos have been subjected to relentless and bigoted attacks by this President and his administration.\"\u00a0 He added, \"Whether it is the disenfranchisement of the people of Puerto Rico or Latino neighborhoods denied access to clean air and water, Latinos in the United States have been burdened for too long by a legacy of systemic discrimination. As President, I will put an end to this administration's discriminatory policies and work to dismantle the institutional barriers that have denied Latinos the opportunity to belong in their country.\"\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0reports that Buttigieg says hi administration would invest $10 billion to create a fund for underrepresented entrepreneurs. In the health care sector, Buttigieg's plan calls for fully funding Puerto Rico's Medicaid program, which would end the disparity in funding between Puerto Rico and other states. In addition, Buttigieg would end the five year waiting for Green Card holders to gain access to public health programs.\u00a0 Ahead of a scheduled environmental justice roundtable in California later this week, Buttigieg proposes to triple the EPA's budget to clean contaminated water and Superfund sites. Buttigieg also indicates his support for legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship and would extend temporary DACA and Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The mayor is also advocating to extend Pell Grant eligibility for Dreamers to access higher education opportunities. BERNIE SANDERS At campaign rallies, the Vermont senator has a habit of listing the various people and groups he's tangled with over the years, such as health insurance companies and President Trump. But for many of the crowds that turn out to see him, the entity that garners the most hisses and boos is the Democratic establishment.\u00a0 In a race that's seen quite a lot of volatility in the polls, Sanders' support has remained relatively consistent. An independent who identifies as a democratic socialist, he's widely adored by the left wing of the party, which still resents the Democratic power brokers they blame for Sanders' loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary.\u00a0 Yet Sanders remains something of an ideological outlier among Democrats despite the fact that some of his signature ideas, such as his \"Medicare for All\" plan to replace private health insurance, have become much more mainstream than they were just a few years ago. And he continues to swear off the big-money donors who are helping propel some other candidates for the Democratic nomination, such as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden. \u00a0 In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte, Sanders said the financing of some of his Democratic rivals' campaigns exemplifies the \"rotten\" nature of American politics.\u00a0 Sanders, a fierce critic of 2010 Supreme Court \"Citizens United v. FEC\" decision that allowed for individuals and corporations to give more freely to political campaigns, believes candidates who rely on big-dollar fundraisers are beholden to the interests of wealthy backers. \"Why would many, many billionaires be contributing to candidates if they didn't think they were getting something out of it? They're not doing it through the goodness of their hearts,\" he said. A recent\u00a0Forbes\u00a0list found that Sanders was the only candidate among the field's top tier, which also includes Biden, Buttigieg, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, to not have a single billionaire donor. According to Sanders and his campaign, this means that the senator is the true champion of the working class, relying almost exclusively on small donors while his opponents show open hands to the open wallets of the ultra-wealthy. Biden and Buttigieg have defended themselves from these allegations and say that big donations do not make them beholden to any donors' interests. When asked if that defense showed either naivet\u00e9 or a lack of honesty, Sanders was hesitant to say his opponents were lying but still expressed skepticism. \"[Accepting money from billionaires] doesn't pass, in a sense, the lab test,\" said Sanders. Back on the trail, Sanders mocks his opponents, saying that he does not spend time \"in billionaires' living rooms and walk away with hundreds of thousands of dollars.\" Buttigieg recently came under scrutiny for holding fundraisers that were closed to the press. For the sake of transparency, the campaign reversed that policy last week. CBS News asked Sanders if Buttigieg having media present ensured that no nefarious deals between candidate and donor were taking place.\u00a0 \"No, not really,\" said Sanders, who still acknowledged allowing press into the fundraisers was a step in the right direction.\" He added, \"I think what history tells us is that the big donors, the people who make large contributions, do get access. They get tax breaks, they get deregulated. That's the way the unfortunate system is working.\" TOM STEYER Businessman Tom Steyer took direct aim at some of the leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, saying they lack what makes him the Democrats' best hope for defeating President Donald Trump in 2020: His business track record. \"If Democrats don't nominate someone who can go head-to-head with him on the economy, Donald Trump will win in 2020,\" Steyer said. \"I have a lot of respect for the four leading Democratic candidates in this race. But here's the truth: none of them, not Vice President Biden, not Senator Warren, not Senator Sanders, not Mayor Pete, have built or run a successful, international business. None of them have a private sector track record of creating jobs. None of them have first-hand experience growing wealth and prosperity.\"\u00a0 Steyer said there are massive systemic issues with the economy that need to be addressed, but, without naming his opponents, said \"the answer is not socialism.\" Instead he said, \"The real answer to historic inequality is not a government takeover of huge parts of our economy, but rather, direct investment in the American people.\" And there's a key difference, Steyer insisted, between him and the other billionaire businessman in the Democratic field, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. \"To attack inequality, America needs a wealth tax,\" Steyer said. \"This is where Mike Bloomberg and I disagree.\" CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says Steyer also repeated his calls to tax income and investments the same amount. He also called for \"building up the innovation and competition\" of the private sector to \"create millions of good-paying, union jobs.\"\u00a0 Steyer said that while he expects Trump to tout his economic record, he believes much of the success is \"fake,\" citing things like low wages despite low unemployment. He argued that the election is also a chance to reverse an \"assault on working families\" that has been led by cuts to taxes for wealthier Americans and weakening labor unions. \"(Trump's) biggest and only play is to point to his so-called economic success \u2014 his fake economic success,\" Steyer said. \"And we, as a party, cannot, and must not, give him that chance.\" ELIZABETH WARREN CBS News campaigner reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says California's Latino Legislative Caucus chair, Lorena Gonzalez, crossed the border into Nevada on Sunday to help the Elizabeth Warren campaign inaugurate its\u00a010th office in the state. Gonzalez, who endorsed the Massachusetts Democrat\u00a0back in October, acknowledged the challenges Warren faces among Latino voters. Just 11 percent of Latino likely voters picked Warren in\u00a0a recent California poll, behind Joe Biden at 19 percent and Bernie Sanders at 32 percent.\u00a0 \"The Latino vote hasn't had the chance to learn everything we know about Elizabeth Warren,\"\u00a0said Gonzalez, praising Warren as a \"chingona\" and a \"guerrera.\" \"Our communities elect fighters and they need to hear her plan to fight for our communities,\" she added later. CALIFORNIA The Democratic National Committee says that its chairman, former Obama Labor Secretary Tom Perez, spent the weekend working the phones looking to avert a looming\u00a0Unite Here union local's\u00a0protest at this week's candidates debate.\u00a0Tin\u00a0says all nine candidates have pledged not to cross the union's picket line if they are unable to resolve their dispute with Sodexo, a food service contractor on the campus of debate host Loyola Marymount University.\u00a0 \"We look forward to continuing negotiations with Sodexo this Tuesday or sooner in hopes of reaching an agreement before Thursday's debate,\" Susan Minato, the union local's co-president,\u00a0said in the statement\u00a0on Sunday.\u00a0 SOUTH CAROLINA South Carolina Democratic Congressman Joe Cunningham announced today that he would be voting in favor of impeaching President Trump during the full House vote on the matter this Wednesday. \"I did not come to Congress to impeach the President but after careful consideration of the evidence and testimony delivered to Congress by dedicated public servants\u2014many of whom the President himself appointed\u2014it is clear to me he committed an impeachable abuse of power,\" said Cunningham in a statement. The first-term lawmaker went on to cite abuse of power and obstruction of justice as the reasons that he supports the articles of impeachment.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0says that the state's Republican Party has called for Cunningham to make a decision for weeks. A person with close knowledge of the RNC's strategy to take back the first congressional seat told\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0that in some ways, the committee needed this vote in order to make a clear-cut case to South Carolina Republicans who voted for Cunningham that he's not a moderate.\u00a0 RNC spokesman Joe Jackson said in a statement Monday that Cunningham's move shows that he is \"choosing Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats' unhinged caucus\" over the wishes of his constituents. \"Voters won't forget his cowardice come November 2020,\" said Jackson in a statement. \"Joe Cunningham's political career is over.\"\u00a0 However, a person close to Cunningham insisted that the Democrat has a unique relationship with first congressional district voters that \"folks in DC and the Republican Party\" don't understand. \"They trust him, they believe him, and they know he operates in good faith. They didn't elect a rubberstamp for Donald Trump, they elected someone who would work on a bipartisan basis to get things done and that is exactly what Joe has done,\" said the person. \"Joe has broken with his party a lot. It's funny to me sometimes when Republicans say 'oh you said you were going to put Lowcountry over party as if that meant [he] was going to vote with Republicans 100% of the time.\" Another House member that is still making a decision about how she will vote days before the full vote is congresswoman and presidential contender Tulsi Gabbard, who told CBS News in a gaggle Sunday that she won't be thinking about political implications when she casts her vote.\u00a0 \"It's really important that every member of Congress cast their vote based on what's in the best interest of the country rather than based on political implications,\" said Gabbard. \"I have always done my best to make decisions and cast votes based on what I believe is the right thing to do even when that decision causes political damage to my quote unquote career reelection chances. That is not a factor for me in my decision making process whatsoever.\" IN THE SENATE The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has endorsed veteran MJ Hegar in the Democratic primary to unseat Republican Senator John Cornyn, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Hegar competed for the 31st U.S. House district in Texas in 2018 but lost to incumbent Republican John Carter. She rose to national attention in part because one of her campaigns ads called \"Doors\" went viral. This cycle, she is competing against 12 other candidates who have filed for the Senate primary in Texas.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota entered the 2020 presidential race Sunday with a speech in the middle of a Midwestern snowstorm, joining a record number of women in the most diverse Democratic primary field in U.S. history. \"At a time when we must heal the heart of our democracy and renew our commitment to the common good, I stand before you as the granddaughter of an iron ore miner, as the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman, as the first woman elected to the United States Senate from the state of Minnesota, to announce my candidacy for president of the United States,\" she told supporters braving frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall at an outdoor rally along the Mississippi River in Minneapolis. Klobuchar, who is expected to tout her moderate politics and Midwestern roots on the campaign trail, denounced the polarization in Washington and the divisiveness in political discourse. \"That sense of community is fracturing across our nation right now, worn down by the petty and vicious nature of our politics. We are tired of the shutdowns and the showdowns, of the gridlock and the grandstanding,\" she said. \"Today, on this snow day, on this island, we say, 'Enough is enough.'\" \"Our nation must be governed not from chaos but from opportunity. Not by wallowing over what's wrong, but by marching inexorably toward what's right,\" she added. Although she rebuked his administration's policies and rhetoric on climate change, political campaign spending, immigration and voting rights, Klobuchar never mentioned President Trump by name during her remarks. Her campaign is hoping her candidacy can get traction in battleground Midwestern states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio that Mr. Trump carried in 2016 election.\u00a0 She urged voters to \"rise to the occasion\" and help her thwart the president's reelection bid and become America's first female president. \"It's time to organize. Time to galvanize. Time to take back our democracy. It's time, America!\" she said to a fervent applause. After the speech, she told reporters she would be stumping in Wisconsin \"because there wasn't a lot of campaigning there\" during the 2016 presidential race. \"That ends with me,\" she said. Klobuchar is the fifth major woman candidate to launch a campaign for the Democratic nomination, joining fellow senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, as well as Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.\u00a0 A former county attorney, Klobuchar was first elected to the Senate in 2006 and\u00a0easily won reelection to a third term in 2018 with a 24-point margin. She is known for her willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion, and has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation that have been signed into law. In 2009, Klobuchar voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. She is pro-choice and supports LGBT rights. She is also an outspoken advocate of gun control measures and has an \"F\" rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA). Klobuchar is a member of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, and made a name for herself for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\u00a0during the contentious hearings in September. After telling him about her father's struggles with alcoholism, she asked Kavanaugh   whether he had ever experienced a \"blackout.\" He retorted, \"Have you?\" The moment quickly went viral, and Kavanaugh later apologized. She was the sole senator from Minnesota until the resolution of the contested Senate election from January to July 2009, which Al Franken eventually won. When Franken was accused of sexual harassment in December 2017, Klobuchar did not call for Franken to step down, unlike many other senators. Franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light. \"I felt I was in a different role as his colleague, that I'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and I felt it was best to handle it in that way,\" Klobuchar\u00a0told CNN\u00a0at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. The Republican National Committee (RNC) dismissed her announcement on Sunday, with a spokesman saying she \"has virtually no grassroots backing\" and referencing\u00a0several\u00a0news reports\u00a0detailing a pattern of alleged abusive treatment toward her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. Later Sunday, Mr. Trump mocked his potential 2020 opponent for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change under heavy snowfall. \"Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!\" the president tweeted. Well, it happened again. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! Scientists \u2014  including those working for Mr. Trump's administration \u2014 have repeatedly rebuffed him for suggesting extreme cold weather disapproves the assessment by the scientific community that the planet's changing climate is causing irreparable environmental damage.

            "article_content": "With reporting by Ed O'Keefe California Sen. Kamala Harris is throwing her hat into the Democratic primary for president, bypassing the formal exploratory stage and going all-in. Harris made it official Monday with a social media video that also introduced her campaign slogan: \"For the people.\" \"I'm running for president,\" she said\u00a0in a Twitter post. \"Let's do this together.\" I'm running for president. Let's do this together. Join us: https://t.co/9KwgFlgZHA pic.twitter.com/otf2ez7t1p Harris is the third U.S. senator and the fourth woman to join the 2020 fray. She is also the first African-American candidate to enter the race, and her campaign rollout speaks to that significance: Her announcement comes on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and her campaign logo was inspired by Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to run for president nearly five decades ago. \"Truth. Justice. Decency. Equality. Freedom. Democracy. These aren't just words. They're the values we as Americans cherish. And they're all on the line now,\" Harris says in her campaign video. \"The future of our country depends on you and millions of others lifting our voices to fight for our American values. That's why I'm running for president of the United States. I'm running to lift those voices. To bring our voices together.\"  Harris will host an official campaign kickoff rally Jan. 27 in Oakland, California. Her campaign headquarters will be based in Baltimore, with a second location in Oakland.  Harris is finishing up a book tour where she has been road-testing potential campaign themes. She had said she would make a decision about running after consulting with family during the winter holiday. And her campaign will be family affair: her sister Maya Harris, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and served as the executive director of the ACLU of Northern California, will serve as Harris' campaign chair.  In December, Harris hinted that a campaign could be imminent and acknowledged the challenges ahead. \"Let's be honest. It's going to be ugly,\" Harris said at the Know Your Value conference in San Francisco. \"When you break things, it is painful. And you get cut. And you bleed.\" Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016, Harris has quickly made a name for herself in the upper chamber, seizing her perch on the Judiciary Committee as a national platform for issues related to the Supreme Court, criminal justice reform, and immigration. In October, she unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail. And she spent much of the 2018 midterm election cycle campaigning for colleagues around the country and building a network of candidates.  But her experience as a prosecutor could help set her apart from other candidates and provide a clear contrast with President Trump, whose administration is at the center of multiple investigations. Harris served as district attorney of San Francisco before being elected as California's attorney general--the first African-American and woman to serve in that post. She is expected to invoke her experience in that post on the campaign trail, in particular, pointing to lawsuits she brought against banks in light of the mortgage crisis and against for-profit colleges for predatory practices. Her prosecutorial record, however, will also come under scrutiny as she pursues the nomination. There has already been some criticism of that record, including an op-ed written in the New York Times questioning her credentials as a \"progressive prosecutor.\"  Harris brings additional diversity to the field, as the daughter of immigrants from India (her mother) and Jamaica (her father).\u00a0 Harris also identifies as the first South Asian-American senator in history, according to her Senate website. Harris could also have a geographical advantage, as California is moving its primary up to March 3, 2020. The Golden State figures to play an outsized role in helping to determine the Democratic nominee for president, compared to previous elections in which the state voted much later in the cycle when fewer candidates remained in the running. Harris has won three statewide elections in California, giving her a potential leg up over opponents planning to compete in the vast and expensive state.

            "article_content": "Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report.  Albuquerque, N.M. - Top Republican Party leaders on Wednesday began sensitive discussions over the scope of support the GOP can give now to President Trump's re-election campaign, amid talk of potential primary challenges, fresh evidence of sagging approval ratings and multiple ongoing government investigations.\u00a0 \t\t\t\t Members of a Republican National Committee (RNC) panel responsible for considering formal resolutions and changes to party rules on Wednesday affirmed their support for the president by passing a resolution offered by Oklahoma Committeewoman Carolyn McClarty that stated the party's \"unequivocal support\" of the president \u2014 a step that a president's own party has never before taken. \t\t\t\t But the ongoing special counsel investigation and intra-party squabbles could threaten Mr. Trump's standing as the presumptive nominee. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, former Senators Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, and former Ohio Governor John Kasich have all been mentioned as potential challengers to Trump for the 2020 GOP presidential nomination \u2014 although none of the men have taken formal steps to begin a campaign.\u00a0 \t\t\t\t All 168 members of the RNC will vote on the resolution during its general session here on Friday. The resolution follows a commitment the RNC is already making to share its data, polling, and infrastructure with the Trump-Pence reelection campaign. But members of the RNC resolutions committee decided not to consider another potential resolution that would express support \"for the re-nomination\" of Trump and Vice President Pence. Jevon Williams, an RNC member from the Virgin Islands, said in an email obtained by CBS News that he had submitted the resolution explicitly supporting re-nomination because \"words matter,\" and the party should have no doubts about working for Mr. Trump's reelection. But his resolution did not receive a motion in the committee and was never voted on.\u00a0 No resolution passed during the annual RNC winter meeting will change the rules of the 2020 GOP primary and nomination process, because those rules were finalized in 2016. Also, it's the state parties that mostly set the rules of how they hold their primaries. For example, the New Hampshire GOP had been considering changing its primary rules to prevent a challenger, but a proposed change ultimately wasn't formally submitted for consideration by the deadline. \u00a0 \t\t\t\t On the sidelines of the RNC winter meeting in Albuquerque, members are also performing an autopsy of the 2018 midterm elections with state executive political directors, digital firms, and lobbying groups that are already thinking about the 2020 battle for Congress.\u00a0 Republicans are already closely monitoring developments in upcoming Senate races in Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee. Sen. David Perdue, of Georgia, who is a close Trump ally, could face a challenge from Democrat Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost a bid for governor while amassing a national political network. National Republicans are trying to convince Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former Kansas congressman, to run for the seat of retiring Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Ky., partly in hopes of keeping former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach \u2014 an outspoken proponent of strict immigration controls who upended the state's gubernatorial race last year \u2014 from seeking the seat. And in Tennessee, Republicans are still sorting out who might run to succeed retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander.  Editor's note: An earlier version of this report said that Kris Kobach was Kentucky secretary of state, rather than Kansas secretary of state. The story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Governors are being sworn in several states Monday, after the 2018 midterm elections. In Georgia, Republican Brian Kemp takes the oath of office in Atlanta. The former Georgia secretary of state rose from underdog status to clinch a Republican primary runoff with tough talk on immigration and a nod from President Trump. His general election campaign against Democrat Stacey Abrams was marked by accusations of voter suppression and mismanagement against Kemp, who served as the state's chief election officer during his run. Kansas' new Democratic governor is expected to take office promising a bipartisan administration even as she and her supporters celebrate a sharp break with her conservative Republican predecessors. Gov.-elect Laura Kelly is scheduled to be sworn in Monday, and in her inaugural address, she's likely to stress the broad themes that underpinned her successful campaign last year. A veteran state senator from Topeka, Kelly pitched herself to voters as a no-nonsense problem-solver who could work with Republicans, who control the Legislature. Kelly's victory drew national attention because Kansas is a predominantly Republican state and her opponent, who was Kansas' secretary of state, Kris Kobach, touted his closeness to President Trump. Kobach is a staunch advocate of voter ID laws. He was vice chairman of the Trump administration's election fraud commission, though the commission eventually found no evidence to support Mr. Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election. Kobach won a narrow victory over Gov. Jeff Colyer in the GOP primary after Mr. Trump endorsed Kobach. In Alabama, Kay Ivey, who said she \"steadied the ship of state\" after taking over for a scandal-battled predecessor nearly two years ago, will be sworn in for her first full term Monday. She takes the oath of office during inauguration festivities at the Alabama Capitol. Ivey, 74, is the state's second female governor and the first Republican woman elected to the position. She had been lieutenant governor, and automatically became governor 21 months ago when then-Gov. Robert Bentley suddenly resigned in the midst of an impeachment investigation partly centered on his relationship with an aide. On Sunday, Republican Mike DeWine was sworn in as governor of Ohio. The former U.S. senator took his oath in a private midnight ceremony at his Cedarville home ahead of a public inauguration planned Monday at the Statehouse.

            "article_content": "In a campaign cycle that has been dominated by conversations on domestic issues, some Iowa voters say they want\u00a02020 Democratic presidential candidates to talk more about what their foreign policy would look like. President Trump's decision to remove U.S. forces from Syria earned a rare bipartisan rebuke from top lawmakers on Monday, putting his foreign policy decisions back in the spotlight. And Iowa Democrats and independents say they want their candidates to start getting specific about how they will restore America's standing in the world, deal with China on trade, and wind down military engagements abroad, according to interviews with more than three dozen voters across the Hawkeye State. Foreign policy is a pocketbook issue in Iowa, where the first contest of the Democratic primary calendar will be held next year. The Hawkeye State, which has approximately 13 million acres of corn and 10 million acres of soybeans, is largely dependent on agriculture, an industry particularly vulnerable to trade wars. In nearly every conversation CBS News had with voters, they expressed their apprehension about the ongoing trade disputes with China, a major importer of American agricultural products. In Iowa City, Christine Gust, a Democrat, said she's been disappointed with the lack of specific solutions from candidates on an issue she described as \"especially important when you think about Iowa.\" Before the trade war with China escalated, a bushel of soybeans traded at roughly $11. But as of this week, the price is hovering around $9 a bushel. The average soybean farmer produces about 50,000 bushels each year, so a $2 drop in prices could mean a loss of about $100,000 in revenue.\u00a0 The impact also trickles down to other sectors of the economy. Farmers who have a large supply of unsold produce in storage tend to hire fewer workers, purchase fewer seeds, and repair farming equipment at a lower rate for the following season. \u00a0 \"Farming is a global business,\" Gust said, \"so we need to hear about that.\" She said there was some conversation at the last Democratic primary debate in Houston \"but there wasn't enough substance.\"\u00a0 Trade, however, isn't the only aspect of foreign policy on the minds of Iowa Democrats. Caucus-goers are also criticizing Mr. Trump for what they perceive as a weakening of America's global influence.\u00a0 Matt McDonald, a 29-year-old who has supported independent candidates the last two cycles, said dealing with foreign affairs \"is a big part of being the president and the commander in chief.\" \"You should be talking about this just as much as you talk about immigration and climate change,\" McDonald, whose brother just returned from a deployment in Afghanistan, said. Bill Mauhroff of Rock Island, Iowa said that Mr. Trump \"is destroying the relationships that we have been building as a nation for decades.\" Maurhoff, a retired commercial banker who's voted Democrat his entire life, says America shouldn't be a \"policeman to the world.\"\u00a0 But others, like 55-year-old Chris Lint, are having a hard time imagining a world where America is no longer the world's only superpower. \"We are the world power,\" Lint said. \"To a certain degree, we need to be a police force.\" Lint said he has two big concerns, \"Kim and Putin,\" referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 \"We need to quit coddling dictators,\" Lint said. Foreign policy, however, is still taking a backseat to domestic issues. Grant Woodard, a former Democratic operative who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2008 Iowa campaign, told CBS News \"we're having more of a debate in terms of the economy and how progressive the party really wants to make itself.\"\u00a0 Woodard said voters are \"mostly focused on healthcare issues and economic issues,\" and because of that \"there is only so much time\" that candidates have to present their arguments on foreign policy. According to Woodard, most Democratic voters agree that China is a rising power, Russia is a threat, and the U.S needs to withdraw from foreign engagements like Afghanistan. But, he said, \"I don't think that many caucus goers are necessarily going to have that be the deciding factor in who they're going to support.\" While some Democratic candidates have put out relatively detailed plans on how they would approach foreign policy, most have kept their focus elsewhere. \"I don't think that they feel the need to really distinguish themselves amongst each other,\" Woodard told CBS News about the Democrats' foreign policy plans. \"I think as you get into a general election, you're always going to hear more about it from a Democratic candidate.\" But some Democratic strategists say that talking about foreign policy is a way to attract Democratic voters debating their many options in a crowded field.\u00a0 John Norris, a longtime Iowa political operative who served as chief of staff for Tom Vilsack during his time as governor of Iowa and Secretary of Agriculture, said he understands \"there is a lot of bread-and-butter issues that the candidates want to and need to talk about.\" He cautioned, however, that it could be a mistake for the presidential hopefuls to not highlight their views on foreign policy. \"I think it is going to be an issue that Iowa caucus goers and voters in general are going to ask to see more examples of competency,\" Norris told CBS News. He added that a candidate who can demonstrate \"depth on foreign policy has the capacity to win over some Iowa Democratic caucus goers.\" \"There will be greater expectations of the candidates to share with Iowa Democrats an ability to tackle foreign policy issues,\" Norris said. \"It's just going to be more critical now than it was six months ago.\" CBS News reporter covering the intersection between politics and tech.",

            "article_content": "London\u00a0\u2014 Prime Minister Boris Johnson is threatening to expel from the party any fellow Conservative lawmakers who try to stand in the way of his plans to pull Britain out of the European Union on October 31, with or without a divorce agreement in place. Johnson has been in office for just several months, but believes he has a mandate to deliver Brexit on any terms \u2014 even if it means a potentially damaging \"no deal\" break-up. Many British lawmakers, including from Johnson's own Conservative Party, believe a no-deal Brexit would be calamitous for the U.K. \u00a0As Parliament reconvenes on Tuesday after the summer recess, those opposed to a no-deal exit will try to block that outcome via legal action, legislation or a no-confidence vote in Johnson's government that, if successful, would force a new national election and could unseat him. Johnson has been lambasted as undemocratic for his bold move last week to shrink the remaining term of Parliament down to just a handful of days by having the legislature suspended from early next week.  It effectively gives Members of Parliament just a week to try and thwart his plans. Any successful bid to do so \u2014 most likely a no-confidence vote or legislation to block a no-deal exit \u2014 will rely on Conservative \"rebels\" going against Johnson.  On Monday, British news outlets said Conservative whips, the lawmakers tasked with maintaining party discipline, had warned the rebels that if they vote against Johnson they will be suspended from the party. \"It's obviously a particularly confrontational approach and, I think, designed, frankly, to realign the Conservative Party, to transform the Conservative Party very much in the direction of a Brexit party,\" David Gauke, a Conservative former Justice Secretary, told CBS News partner network BBC News on Monday. At least some of the Conservative rebels appear ready to take the risk of excommunication from their party. Buzzfeed reported Monday that a group of Conservatives is working with opposition lawmakers on legislation that would force Johnson to seek an extension from the EU  on the October 31 Brexit deadline if no deal is agreed by a set date before then. Buzzfeed said the bill was expected to be put forth for a vote within just hours of Parliament reconvening on Tuesday. That report was unconfirmed, as were rumors that Johnson might call a snap national election himself, essentially expecting to notch a clear victory for his party and thus boost his perceived mandate to steer the country out of the EU. Economists, including the government's own, have warned that leaving the European Union without a deal in place with the bloc could severely damage the U.K. economy, lead to shortages of fresh foods and medicines and long delays for people and goods at ports of entry. Johnson's government dismisses that as \"project fear,\" and insists the country is well prepared to crash out of the EU. More ideologically, those who oppose leaving the EU without an agreement argue that the British public wasn't given an honest assessment of its choice in the run-up to the Brexit referendum of 2016. The pro-Brexit campaign, which Johnson himself led, always insisted that agreeing the terms of a divorce with the EU would be a simple task. It has proved to be anything but.  Britons, the pro-remain and anti-no-deal crowd argue, never voted to cut ties with the 28-nation bloc without the new terms of their future relationship being made clear.  Johnson and his close group of hardline Brexit allies in the government argue, however, that the people have spoken; they voted in 2016 to leave the EU, and now that vote must be honored, come hell or high water. There are also complicated implications for the future cohesion of the United Kingdom if a no-deal Brexit comes to pass. Britain is actually four unified nations; England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Support for a second independence referendum in Scotland, where a majority opted to remain in the EU in 2016 is believed to have grown since that original vote. Two years before that Brexit referendum, Scots voted to stay in the U.K. in a separate, national referendum (yes, they seem to have become a trend over here).  The outcome of a potential second independence referendum in Scotland is far from certain, but calls for one to happen are mounting. Then there's Northern Ireland. The British territory is the only U.K. soil that has a land border with the EU, as the Republic of Ireland is an independent nation and EU member state. The Good Friday Agreement of 1999 ended years of bloody sectarian conflict and opened the Irish border up for smooth traffic.  In the 20 years since, many people have built their lives and businesses around their ability, and the ability of goods they buy and sell, to pass between the two countries without friction.  The EU is adamant that any Brexit agreement with Britain must include a so-called \"backstop\" provision, designed to ensure the Irish border stays open even if negotiations between the U.K. and Brussels drag on for years.  Johnson and other Brexiteers say the way the backstop is crafted, it would effectively keep Britain beholden to EU regulations if no broader agreement was reached. That qualm blocked approval in Britain's Parliament of the draft agreement reached by Johnson's predecessor with Brussels.  There's has been no indication yet that the EU is willing to renegotiate the backstop. If Brexit goes ahead with no deal, it would mean re-institution of at least some security checks on the Irish border, as all goods and people would suddenly be subject to customs and immigration inspection. That, many fear, could rekindle tensions still simmering just beneath the surface. Tucker Reals is the CBSNews.com foreign editor, based at the CBS News London bureau.",

            "article_content": "Voters in Iowa will be the first to weigh in on which Democrat should take on Donald Trump. In a \"CBS This Morning\" original series \"Three Meals,\" CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe spoke with the state's voters at the Iowa State Fair, which attracted more than a million people to Des Moines. O'Keefe spoke with voters over breakfast, lunch, and dinner about the issues that matter to them most.\u00a0 A day at the fair begins early, as thousands who camp out overnight go in search of breakfast. We visited Hardenbrook's, where we met Democrats Dennis and Janet Hampton. They've been coming to the fair since they got married half a century ago.\u00a0\"I've got a lot of friends who are Republicans too, and they're saying the same thing: 'We gotta work together now,'\" Dennis said. Both Hamptons said they're concerned about climate change, and turned off by the president's approach to immigration. \"We're all immigrants, bar none,\" Dennis said. Iowans have a reputation for being nice -- so when the Hamptons see fighting in Washington, they offer some home-cooked advice. \"Sit down and talk about it,\" Janet said. \"Communication, don't say Republican and Democrat.\" \"Keep your mouth shut more,\" Dennis added. Most eating at the fair happens on the go. More than 80 food items are available on a stick -- but the fair is also a display of Iowa's farming might. One of the most popular sights is the famous butter cow, which attracts tens of thousands of people each day.\u00a0About 85% of Iowa's land is used for agriculture. It exports about $10 billion worth of goods, but that's been on the decline because of the fight over trade and tariffs. We visited the Rib Shack for lunch, where we caught up with Georgia Gent, a farmer from Wellman, and her friend, Jane Ackerman. The pair were concerned about President Trump's tweets regarding trade with China, which have the potential to sway the market. \"Yeah, tens of thousands of dollars can be lost,\" Gent said. \"If you're looking out for the country, if you're looking out for the family farmer, we don't need to have controversy like that.\" \"And how the farmer does affects us, big time,\" Ackerman said. \"If they don't have a good year, they're not going to be buying, you know, a $10,000 mower in the spring.\" \u00a0Ackerman and her family sell golf carts and lawn mowers in eastern Iowa. And while business is good, they said they're feeling the impact of the president's policies.\u00a0\"Right now we're having huge problems getting parts to fix mowers,\" Ackerman said. \"We can't fix it because we can't get the part, and that's hard, very hard.\"\u00a0Gent, a Democrat, likes former vice president Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but she's keeping an open mind. \"Before the election I want to see everybody that I'm interested in,\" she said. Ackerman said she voted for President Trump in 2016, but doesn't feel he's delivered. \"I am a registered Republican, but I'm just ready for change,\" she said. Max Bertsos and his girlfriend Brette Deaton are young Democrats who support \"Medicare for All.\" They currently get their health care through their employers, but would be willing to part ways with that system.\u00a0\"Through my job I still have a $2,000 deductible,\" Deaton said. \"I'd rather pay some in taxes up front and know that I can go to the doctor whenever I feel like I need to.\"\u00a0Bertsos recently moved to Des Moines from Dayton, Ohio, and was shaken by the recent mass shooting there. \"That was 15 minutes away from my house,\" he said said. Bertsos and Deaton even felt some nervousness coming to the fair because of the shooting. \"It's really terrifying,\" Deaton said. \"I'm fairly firmly pro-gun control. At the end of the day, I think we gotta to try something, though, because doing nothing has just made it worse and worse and worse.\" Fun at the fair continues well after dark, with rides, live music and beer. At a craft beer tent, O'Keefe met conservative Phil Stanislav, who said he wants \"somebody who's going to just tell it like it is -- and you may not like what he tells, but he tells it the way he sees it.\"\u00a0 Another voter, soybean farmer Amy Staudt, said she supports the administration's tariff strategy. \"He's rocking boats right now, Trump is, and I don't know if it's a bad thing, so I'm going to sit back and wait,\" Staudt said. But even though she's a Trump supporter, she said she's open to voting for a Democrat.\u00a0 \"I want to see someone that's going to change what happens in our farm community, our small business community, our health insurance,\" Staudt said.",

            "article_content": "Criticism of former President Obama by Democrats running for president came as a surprise to Joe Biden. In remarks Thursday, Obama's former vice president told reporters that during the primary debate\u00a0Wednesday night, \"I was a little surprised at how much incoming there was about Barack, about the president ... I don't think there's anything that he has to apologize for. It kind of surprised me the degree of the criticism.\" Biden was the most targeted candidate on stage Wednesday night, fending off questions about his health care proposal to build on the Affordable Care Act, and the high number of deportations during the Obama administration. Biden repeatedly defended Obama's record on immigration, noting that he instituted the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \"I hope the next debate we can talk about our answers to fix the things that Trump has broken, not how Barack Obama made all these mistakes. He didn't,\" Biden said Thursday. He added that repeated criticism of the former president was a \"game to make sure that we hand the Republicans the election.\" Biden also said he looked forward to attending a debate with fewer candidates on stage, which would allow for longer responses to questions and rebuttals to direct attacks. The rules to qualify for the next primary debate in September are far more stringent -- candidates need to have 130,000 unique donors and register at least 2% support in four polls. So far, only seven candidates, including Biden, have met those qualifications. \"The idea that we don't actually have a chance to explain our policies, in less than one minute ... that's not a debate,\" Biden said. \"I'm looking forward to getting to a place where we can actually exchange ideas.\" Asked if there was anything he would change about his performance on Wednesday night, Biden brought up his exhortation to debate watchers to \"visit Joe 30330\" during his closing statement, leaving viewers confused. \"I would've said to 'text'\" Joe to 30330, Biden said with a laugh.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump in a torrent of tweets\u00a0dampened already low expectations for revived trade discussions with China that began in Shanghai on Tuesday. The White House had  pushed to revive the talks, stalled since May.  \"My team is negotiating with them now, but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit,\" Mr. Trump said of China in one of his tweets on the topic Tuesday morning.\u00a0 Mr. Trump also suggested that China may be waiting until after the 2020 election to sign a trade deal, adding \"if & when I win, the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now...or no deal at all.\" Mr. Trump later said China is \"praying\" for him to lose the election. \"An alternative explanation for China failing to agree to a deal with Trump is based on his own actions. China asks itself, What's the point?,\" Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said in a tweet following Mr. Trump's postings. Any agreement now is likely to be a \"short-term fix,\" he predicted. Bown pointed to Trump's now withdrawn threat \u00a0to slap tariffs on Mexican imports over a non-trade related matter -- immigration -- as one reason for Chinese negotiators to be wary. \u00a0China, trade agreement, trade, United States, Donald Trump, negotiation\u00a0 \u00a0The White House in May suspended its latest threat to slap tariffs on about $300 billion of imported Chinese goods that aren't already subject to the duties. U.S. businesses and ultimately consumers pay for tariffs, not the exporting countries like China. Mr. Trump's threats aren't working, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a state-sponsored news organization in China, suggested in a tweet on Tuesday.\u00a0 \"Whenever it's time to negotiate, the U.S. side comes up with the trick of piling pressure. Really not a good habit. Americans need to change their negotiating style, show more sincerity, not just wield [a] stick,\" he wrote. \"In general there's not high expectations for these talks in Shanghai,\"\u00a0 David Dollar of the Brookings Institution said at an\u00a0event\u00a0in Washington, D.C., on Monday. Dollar said he was \"hopeful\" for a \"mini-deal\" that includes China resume some agricultural purchases from the U.S. it has stopped or shifted elsewhere after an earlier round of tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump. Chinese state media reported late Sunday that the country is resuming buying some agricultural products from the U.S. But that \"will not lead to a breakthrough,\" analysts at Height Capital wrote ahead of talks this week. The move, instead, likely means China expects the existing stalemate to continue, they wrote. Mr. Trump's \"desire to force a deal\" is likely \"offset by a desire to avoid negative economic data ahead of re-election,\" the Height analysts noted on Monday. That's probably what led to the May \"ceasefire\" in the trade war and \"we expect it will remain a powerful motivator against additional escalation.\"\u00a0 A more sweeping agreement involving technology transfer demands on U.S. companies by China and other major disagreements would take longer than this latest round of talks to negotiate, experts have said. Mr. Trump's tariffs, including those on\u00a0 the import of Chinese goods, are slowing growth in some sectors of the U.S. economy, according to the Federal Reserve's beige book\u00a0released\u00a0earlier this month.\u00a0 U.S. gross domestic product\u00a0slowed in the second quarter\u00a0to 2.1%, slipping from the first quarter, the latest numbers showed last Friday.\u00a0 \"ATTN @realDonaldTrump: Everyone loses in a trade war, including the U.S.! Americans have paid $30 billion in tariffs aka taxes. Farmers are going bankrupt. The trade war is a drag on economic growth. Just look at last quarter GDP\" a political group called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland said in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0pointing to a Wall Street Journal editorial on the topic.\u00a0 So the Trump administration may be cautious about moving forward with the new threatened tariffs. Still, they may also decide it's not in their political interest to pare back those already in place, Brookings' Dollar said.\u00a0 U.S. stocks dipped slightly Tuesday after Mr. Trump's remarks amid the new round of negotiations with China and ahead of tomorrow's widely anticipated Fed decision on interest rates.\u00a0",

And they've already attracted more celebrity, controversy and conflict than many lawmakers see in a lifetime. They are known as \"the Squad\" \u2014 four progressive Democratic congresswomen of color who have become the new face of the Democratic Party, whether you like it or not. All four were elected to the House last year and became part of the most diverse Congress in U.S. history.\u00a0 Since then, the Squad members have won legions of liberal fans with their fiery tweets, their support for ambitious progressive proposals like the Green New Deal, and their calls to impeach President Trump. All of this, of course, has also earned them plenty of critics and made them prominent political bogeymen for Republicans. (They've even received death threats.) Their activist agenda is sometimes at odds with the leaders of their own party. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got into a spat with Squad members\u00a0about that culminated in Pelosi saying in a closed-door caucus meeting that Democrats should stop tweeting their grievances about fellow party members.\u00a0 But those disputes pale in comparison to the battle that erupted when President Trump took aim at the Squad in a series of racist tweets. Trump tweeted that \"'Progressive' Democratic congresswomen\" should \"go back\" to where they came from, even though three of the Squad members were born in the U.S. and the fourth has been a citizen for two decades. Mr. Trump never named any of the congresswomen in his tweets, but made clear in later statement who he had in mind. The Squad members, in turn, hosted a press conference together to push back against the president. A week rarely goes by without one of the Squad members making headlines \u2014 and getting into a political battle. Here's what you need to know about these four freshmen lawmakers. Ocasio-Cortez represents a district covering parts of the Bronx and Queens. She set off the progressive wave in Congress last summer with her stunning primary upset\u00a0over one of the most powerful Democrats in the House. A former bartender and waitress, Ocasio-Cortez defeated Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent. When she won the general election in November at just 29 years old, she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 who is now widely known as \"AOC\" \u2014 has led the charge on some of the most prominent, and most disputed, proposals from the Democrat-controlled House. She co-sponsored the Green New Deal, a legislative package that calls for a massive overhaul of the U.S. economy to combat climate change, and she has supported Medicare for All, free public college and a 70% marginal tax rate for Americans making more than $10 million. She is a leading critic of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and called for the entire agency to be abolished.\u00a0 Ocasio-Cortez has also become a social media icon and often uses Twitter to promote her policies, fight with her critics and cheer her fellow Squad members. She is by far the most popular House member on Twitter, with nearly 4.8 million followers.\u00a0 Omar, 37, represents a district including Minneapolis and its suburbs. She is one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, and previously served in the Minnesota House. Omar was born in Somalia. Her family fled the country to escape civil war and lived for years in a refugee camp in Kenya. She came to the U.S. when she was 10, and became a citizen at 17, in 2000. Omar's election also made her the first Somali-American in Congress, and the first naturalized citizen from Africa. Her victory spurred the House to end its 181-year ban on headwear, and Omar became the first woman to wear a hijab on the House floor. She has been an outspoken critic of U.S. foreign policy and American support for Israel, leading to accusations of anti-Semitism, which she has denied. Omar also attracted widespread criticism for a speech she gave at a Council on American-Islamic Relations meeting, in which she said the Muslim civil rights group \"was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something.\" The backlash over her comment was so severe that Pelosi asked Capitol Police to give Omar extra security. President Trump has been particularly vicious in his criticism of Omar, falsely claiming that she \"hates Jews\" and supports al-Qaeda. On the latter accusation, Omar said she would \"not dignify it with an answer,\" and that Muslims should not constantly be asked to condemn terrorists. Pressley, 45, represents a district including parts of Boston, Cambridge and surrounding towns. She is the first black woman from Massachusetts to serve in Congress, and was previously the first black woman elected to Boston's City Council. She has more years of elected political experience than any other member of the Squad.\u00a0 Like Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley defeated a 10-term incumbent, Michael Capuano, in a surprise primary victory.\u00a0 Pressley has spoken about surviving a sexual assault when she was a student at Boston University. She has been an advocate for sexual assault survivors in Congress, arguing for better protections for victims, and she is also a staunch supporter of abortion rights. Pressley's first amendment introduced on the House floor called for lowering the voting age from 18 to 16, but it did not pass.\u00a0 Along with Omar, Tlaib is one of the first two Muslim women in Congress. She is also the first Palestinian-American woman in Congress. Tlaib, 42, represents a district including parts of Detroit and its suburbs, and she previously served in the Michigan House.\u00a0 Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez are both members of the Democratic Socialists of America, and the first two women of the organization in Congress.\u00a0 \"I think it is a new time,\" Tlaib told \"CBS This Morning\" in November 2018, days before being elected. \"It's a new era of the Civil Rights movement. And it's time for a change.\" Although all of the Squad members have said President Trump should be impeached, Tlaib's call for impeachment attracted the most attention \u2014 because of one particular swear word. Soon after being sworn in, Tlaib told a crowd of supporters, \"We're going to impeach the motherf****er.\" She refused to apologize for the remark, writing on Twitter, \"I will always speak truth to power.\"",

Tim Ryan are all presidential candidates whose campaigns raised less money in the second quarter of the year than that of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In a stunning show for any member of the House, especially a freshman member, Ocasio-Cortez raised over $1.2 million in the second quarter and has over $1.4 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign's filings with the Federal Election Commission. Ocasio-Cortez is likely the best well-known freshman member of Congress because of her outspoken advocacy on progressive issues such as Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It's also made her a punching bag for Republicans and some moderate Democrats who think that she is dragging the Democratic Party too far to the left. She has also formed a partnership with Reps. Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, a group colloquially known as the \"Squad.\" President Trump said on Twitter Sunday that \"'Progressive' Democratic Congresswomen\" should \"go back\" to their countries \u2014 even though three of the four members of the squad he seemed to have in mind were born in the U.S. and all are American citizens. GOP Rep. Devin Nunes raised the most money of any House member in the second quarter with over $1.8 million in contributions.

            "article_content": "SEN. KAMALA HARRIS: CBS News campaign reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0reports that in the hours leading up to the second round of the first 2020 Democratic debate, Harris' congressional office spent the day pumping-out a couple Senate-related actions. In the various press releases, Harris joined New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and several other lawmakers in calling for the president to grant temporary protected status (TPS) to Venezuelans. She and other colleagues also issued a press release introducing what she called \"the first ever bipartisan U.S. Senate resolution to honor the 50th Anniversary of the Stonewall uprising.\" Harris is expected to show her prosecutorial questioning and debating skills on the stage in Miami tonight. GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER: The former Colorado governor spent a few hours before tonight's debate taking questions in an \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Reddit. Some of the questions ranged from igneous rocks (a geologist question) to why he is not running for Senate instead of president.\u00a0Ramirez\u00a0says Hickenlooper also faced online criticism for welcoming the legalization of Marijuana in his run for president. Critics have pointed out that Hickenlooper was originally against legalizing recreational marijuana when the issue came up in Colorado. Hickenlooper, in his answer, also called on the federal government to study marijuana use and update banking laws around marijuana. He wants the criminal justice system to expunge and reduce sentences for those who have been convicted for low-level, non-violent marijuana offenses. Supporters can expect Hickenlooper to call for a rejection of \"democratic socialism\" while on stage against a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. BETO O'ROURKE: CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that South Carolina Rep. Marvin Pendarvis says it was an experience of a lifetime to be invited to the Democratic debate as a guest of candidate Beto O'Rourke. While some reports noted that O'Rourke did not have the breakout moment that some say he needed, surrogate Pendarvis disagreed, saying he thinks he did well on the issues of climate change, health care and immigration policy reform. \"Going into the debate, he needed to stay on message on the issues that he'd always been talking about on the campaign trail,\" said Pendarvis. \"And so if you look at some of his answers to those questions, I think he stayed on message despite some attempts by some of the other candidates to get him off message.\" DOWN SOUTH:\u00a0As the Supreme Court handed down a ruling on gerrymandering, which will leave the issue of drawing congressional districts to the states, South Carolina's state parties weighed in on the decision.\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0says South Carolina GOP chairman Drew McKissick says that politics don't have a place in the courts and that today's ruling is a win for keeping the judiciary out of politics. \"While Democrats will continue to try and win in court because they can't win at the ballot box, I agree with the majority opinion which stated that the solution does not lie with the federal judiciary,\" said McKissick.\u00a0 On the other side of the aisle, South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Trav Robertson Jr. released a statement as well, stating the court's ruling is a slap in the face to American democracy. \"Republicans will continue their shell game by creating super-majority districts to silence communities of color and artificially boost the number of GOP seats,\" said Robertson. \"The fact is that fair redistricting means less seats for Republicans and they are more concerned with winning than with preserving our democracy.\"\u00a0 The Supreme Court ruled on a North Carolina case in which districts were drawn by the state's Republican-controlled legislature. Pendarvis, the Democratic congressman, said today's ruling will likely play to the benefit of the state GOP.\u00a0 \"In a state where Democrats have been in the minority for some time and every election many seats go unchallenged because of the makeup of the maps, I would imagine it's going to continue to embolden our own legislature,\" said Pendarvis. \"It's unfortunate because it doesn't give Democrats any political cover to be able to seek any guidance from the Supreme Court as to exactly how they'd rule on such a thing.\" MONEY MATTERS ON THE $$$:\u00a0Recode\u00a0published figures\u00a0on Wednesday illustrating where donations from employees of tech giants ended up in the last quarter.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says some are no surprise, like Washington Gov. Jay Inslee leading among Washington-based Amazon and Microsoft. Harris ranks towards the top among California-based Facebook and Twitter. But New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker also received a significant amount of donations, whose Stanford credentials and (sometimes fraught) Silicon Valley ties\u00a0are well-documented. And over at Google, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders far outstrip their West Coast 2020 competitors.\u00a0 Joe Biden may give these candidates a race for their money this Friday when he heads to the Bay Area\u00a0for a fundraising sweep. But\u00a0with some events reportedly\u00a0hosted by former tech company executives and investors, the former vice president could be competing for donors who run in different circles than the engineers and designers donating to Warren and Sanders. Most of the top\u00a0Warren\u00a0and\u00a0Sanders\u00a0donors are infrequent political contributors at best, some with little to no donations on record from the 2016 presidential race.",

            "article_content": "Supporters of President Trump lined up outside of the Orlando, Florida, arena where Mr. Trump will be officially launching his presidential campaign with a rally Tuesday night. The crowd began to assemble more than 24 hours before the doors to the arena opened. By Monday evening, there were already several hundred people lined up for the president's Orlando re-election announcement. One man at the head of the line told CBS News he arrived at 2 a.m. on Monday morning, a day and a half before the doors open at 3 p.m. on Tuesday. Another  man told CBS News: \"[Trump] gave up his life for us, we can give up two days for him.\" Many of those waiting had camping tents, event tents, and lawn chairs pitched along two long blocks, and most planned to stay through the night. Some have hotel rooms nearby they planned not to use for fear of losing their spot in line, or took turns switching between the hotel and their spot in line with friends. Many of the Trump supporters in line said the most pressing issues for them were the economy, immigration and security. Asked about their thoughts on the Democratic candidates, several said they do not want the U.S. to become a socialist country. One woman told CBS News: \"Socialism is not my thing. I don't want to be a socialist country and that's one of the biggest things with Trump. He says we'll never be a socialist country and I hope that we never will be.\" Another woman said, \"I don't think socialism is the best thing for America. I don't see why people want socialism.\" No one expressed concern about Mr. Trump's willingness to accept opposition research from foreign nations, but several mentioned Hillary Clinton and Christopher Steele, the former British operative who compiled the infamous Trump dossier. Meanwhile, opponents of Mr. Trump's reelection announcement on Tuesday are launching their protests at a nearby gay bar where a mariachi band and a drag queen will perform in what they say is a juxtaposition of the president's policies. Organizers of the \"Win With Love Rally\" said Mr. Trump's announcement in Orlando Tuesday night is an affront to a city with a large Puerto Rican population and a visible gay community. Orlando is at the center of the Interstate 4 corridor, stretching from Tampa to Daytona Beach, which is considered one of the most politically unpredictable parts of the nation's largest swing state. Opponents in Orlando blame the Republican president for holding up disaster aid to Puerto Rico over a feud with Democratic leaders on the island. The Trump administration also has moved to revoke newly won health care protections for transgender people, restrict their presence in the military, and withdraw federal guidance that trans students should be able to use bathrooms of their choice. The president's campaign kickoff comes a week after the third anniversary of the massacre of 49 people at the gay Pulse club, a turning point for Orlando community leaders in embracing ideas of diversity and tolerance, said Ida Eskamani, a protest organizer. \"Orlando is such a bastion of hope and love and solidarity of marginalized people since Pulse and we have embraced that identity of who we are as a community,\" Eskamani said. \"We want to show the country that Trump's brand of politics doesn't work along the I-4 corridor. We are ready to win with love.\" The chairman of the local Republican Party said Mr. Trump is fighting for all Americans. \"For them to say Donald Trump doesn't like gay people is wrong. For them to say Donald Trump doesn't like Hispanics is wrong,\" said Charles Hart, chairman of the Orange County Republican Executive Committee. Organizers of the Trump announcement on Tuesday were hosting an all-day festival - dubbed \"45 Fest\" - outside the Amway Center where the president will speak at night.\u00a0 Others planned to be in Orlando to highlight Mr. Trump's track record. An attorney who said he represented dozens of former illegal workers at Trump properties planned a news conference with seven of the workers, along with union members to show \"Trump's hypocrisy toward immigrants and his economic policies that hurt all workers,\" according to a statement. Protest organizers also were promising an appearance by the \"Baby Trump\" blimp at the bar after they raised money to bring it from South Florida. However, the blimp will stay at the bar, located about three blocks from the arena, due to presidential airspace restrictions, Eskamani said. Sara Cook contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Davenport, Iowa\u00a0- Nearly 20 Democratic presidential candidates fanned out across Iowa over the past couple of days. But when Joe Biden landed in the Hawkeye State Tuesday, he had his eye on only one competitor: Donald Trump. The two 70-something rivals fanned across the state on the same day, offering a split screen moment that could, if Biden has his way, serve as a preview of a general election campaign -- never mind that the Iowa caucuses are still more than 230 days away.  Each had the other on his mind. In a new addition to his stump speech, Biden called the president \"a fundamental threat to America.\" And before boarding Air Force Once to travel to Iowa, Mr. Trump called the current Democratic frontrunner \"the weakest mentally\" and said the other candidates have \"much more energy.\"  Both revelled in occupying the other's attention. \"He was someplace in Iowa today and he said my name so many times people couldn't stand it anymore,\" Mr. Trump said of Biden during a speech in Des Moines.  \"I guess he's really fascinated with me,\" Biden told a gathering in Mount Pleasant after he learned his speech in Ottumwa earlier in the day was carried live by Fox News, which the presidential candidate watched aboard his plane. \"I hope Donald Trump's presence here is making a clarifying moment for us all,\" he said in Davenport. Biden couldn't have scripted the day better himself, particularly as he garnered criticism for the slow pace of his campaign schedule and after his rivals seized upon his absence from Iowa over the weekend to try gain momentum. The former vice president has so far paid little attention to the other Democrats in the race. In Davenport, he told the crowd he missed the weekend events with the other 2020 contenders to attend his granddaughter's graduation, and revealed he and his family spent the afternoon celebrating with the Obamas. The story had an intended purpose, reminding voters here of his closeness to the former president, whose surprise caucus victory here in 2008 supercharged his campaign.  Biden told reporters in Mount Pleasant that intraparty fighting is \"only going to make it easier for Trump to win.\" And asked about his debate prep, he downplayed the stakes. \"This will be an appearance more than a debate. I am told we have one minute. I will go out there and say why I'm running and what I stand for.\" The dueling visits came as a new Quinnipiac University poll shows Biden leading Mr. Trump nationally in a hypothetical matchup by the widest margin of the other contenders, and a CNN-Des Moines Register poll finds Biden leading the Democratic pack.\u00a0 Additionally, internal polling from the Trump campaign found the president trailing Biden in some key battleground states. Two of the three counties Biden visited Tuesday were won by Mr. Trump in 2016. In Henry County, for example, he focused his pitch on ways he believed Trump's economic policies failed them.  But conversations with voters throughout the state over the past several days and underlying polling data reveal support for the vice president is soft, and that while the race is beginning to gel, it is far from set.  Many voters who came to various events had not yet committed to a candidate, telling CBS News they were still in the listening phase. And some acknowledged that while they would support Biden if he were to become the nominee, they were drawn to the other contenders. \"My problem with Joe, he's just an old pair of shoes to me. He's comfortable but I want youth. I think Joe is too old. I think Trump's too old. And I think Bernie is too old. I'm looking for someone young,\" said Chris Johnson, a 69-year-old retiree who attended a Kamala Harris event in Dubuque, but has not settled on a candidate.  \"I love Joe. I think 2016 would have been a really great year for Joe. I'm not looking for an old man over the age of sixty that has had their chance to do things, and that to kind of not be the generic old white man that you always see in our politics,\" said Hannah Simpson, a 28-year-old pre-school teacher, who said she liked Elizabeth Warren and Steve Bullock. \"I think he is a great person and I respect everything he's done. But I don't think that's what we need right now for our country.\"  Others weighed Biden's vulnerabilities. \"I like that he's very authentic, I feel like his values represent my values,\" said Lynn Ellsworth, a retired archivist from Mount Pleasant. But she said she was concerned about \"his age and whether he's going to be in tune with younger people. I think it's time for younger people to make their voices heard, because they are coming up.\" \"He's probably the best chance we've got, but there's a lot of really good people,\" said May Swarm, another Mount Pleasant resident. \"He's been around for a long time -- that's an advantage and a disadvantage.\" Swarm continued, \"But we need to somebody who knows how to be presidential, that's for sure. And he does that.\"  Electability against Mr. Trump and restoring \"dignity\" to the office is central to Biden's campaign pitch. And it helped to convert at least one uncommitted voter. Susan Simmons, a customer service representative from Bettendorf told CBS that after seeing Biden in Davenport, \"he rose to the top, way above the rest.\" Simmons grew teary-eyed, saying \"I could just cry for the fact he understands we need to bring dignity back to the office.\"  And his visit to the state attracted at least some interest from Trump supporters like Darren Willson, a Danville resident who works at a distribution center. Wilson said he voted for Barack Obama in 2008 but chose Trump in 2016, and that he came to Mount Pleasant to hear what Biden had to say. \"I think Joe is a good guy. I don't think there is anything wrong with him,\" Wilson told CBS. \"If he is here to represent all people, that's awesome.\" But Wilson wasn't yet ready to leave the president. \"When the Democrats were in office, I had better benefits, I had better pay. But, I like the way Trump is handling immigration. I like the way he is handling other things.\"\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

Though in the past, some Democrats have contemplated skipping over the South, where it's been notoriously difficult for a Democrat to win, the former vice president claimed that wouldn't be his strategy. \"I plan on campaigning in the South,\" Biden said at the Moral Action Congress of the Poor People's Campaign, in Washington, D.C. Monday. \"I plan on, if I'm your nominee, winning Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, believe it or not, and I believe we can win Texas and Florida, if you look at the polling data now.\"\u00a0 The question to Biden came at an event focused on poverty and the economy. It took note of the fact that many of the country's poorer economies are in the South -- not just mostly minority communities, but also largely white communities. The ten candidates appearing before the forum were asked whether they'd campaign in these parts of the country, where poverty crosses racial and gender divides. \u00a0 \"I have no intention of walking away,\" Biden said.\u00a0 A University of Texas / Texas Tribune poll released Monday found President Trump's reelection support evenly split --\u00a0half of registered voters in Texas would vote for Mr. Trump in 2020, and half would not. Though his Republican support there is strong, with 73% saying they'd \"definitely\" vote for Mr. Trump, 60% of independents said they would not vote for Mr. Trump if the election were held today. However, if history is any predictor, Biden -- should he win the Democratic nomination -- would face a steep climb on fulfilling the promise of winning all the southern states he named at the forum. Neither Texas nor South Carolina has voted to send a Democrat to the White House since Jimmy Carter ran in 1976. Georgia, meanwhile, hasn't voted for the Democrat in a presidential election since it went for Bill Clinton in 1992.\u00a0 Biden also warned against those who would use immigration as a wedge issue, and he took a swipe at the president in the process. \"Stop letting these guys use the divisions in the country as a means -- like charlatans always do -- to divide the country. 'Well, the reason why that black man doesn't have a job in your county is because of that white immigrant coming across the border here, or that Hispanic, or that Muslim or whatever,'\" he said.\u00a0 \"It's used by charlatans all the time.

            "article_content": "Just as global markets had recovered from the last round of tariffs on Chinese imports, they are tumbling again after President Trump announced by tweet on Thursday that the U.S. will impose a 5% tariff on all imports from Mexico - which could increase to 25% - unless the Mexican government \"substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory.\" On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied,.. In a statement issued on Friday, the president said Mexico's \"passive cooperation in allowing this mass incursion constitutes an emergency and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\" \"To address the emergency at the Southern Border, I am invoking the authorities granted to me by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act,\" he added. According to the Congressional Research Service, the law has never been used to impose tariffs. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called the move \"a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent.\" Virginia Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine condemned the decision for the effect tariffs will have on Virginians in a statement: \"What this Administration fails to understand is that, just as Trump's family separation policy failed, hiking tariffs on Mexico won't deter families escaping violence and instability in their native countries from crossing our border.\"  Acting secretary for Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan, said on Thursday that the situation at the border has become a national emergency, with a record number of \"over 80,000 people in custody\" -- a dramatic increase from just two weeks ago, when he told Face the Nation's Margaret Brennan that there were 16,000 in custody. Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador defended his country's efforts to stop the flow of Central American migrants traveling through Mexico to the U.S., and added that \"social problems are not solved with duties or coercive measures.\" L\u00f3pez Obrador also announced he was sending his foreign minister to Washington to negotiate with U.S. officials ahead of the June 10 deadline set by President Trump. CBS News has confirmed through several Trump administration officials that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer were initially against the tariffs, arguing they could affect markets and jeopardize ratification of the USMCA, the president's U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in Congress-- which is already facing obstacles in the Democratic controlled House. The economic team eventually came to a consensus and now agree with the president's decision. Earlier this week, Special counsel Robert Mueller, in his first public statement about his two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, explained why his office did not indict President Trump for obstruction of justice \u2013 and why they could not exonerate the president. \"As set forth in the report, after the investigation, if we had confidence that the president did not clearly commit a crime, we would have said so,\" Mueller stated. Citing Justice Department policy prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president, Mueller said, \"charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.\" While the special counsel's office did not make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime, Mueller added that the Constitution requires a \"process other than the criminal justice system\" to address wrongdoing by a president. President Trump reiterated on Thursday that no charges against him proves him \"innocent,\" while critics have taken Mueller's comment to mean it is now up to Congress to take up the issue of obstruction. However, in an exclusive interview with CBS News' Chief Legal Correspondent Jan Crawford, Attorney General William Barr said he \"personally felt\" special counsel Robert Mueller \"could have reached a decision\" on obstruction of justice. \"The [OLC] opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office, but he could've reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity,\" Barr said. Barr also said he believes government interference into a U.S. election is equally concerning as foreign interference, and that's why he sought the authority to declassify information as part of his review of the origins of the Russia investigation. But Democrats argue the effort is politically driven to feed the president's claim that the FBI was attempting to mount a \"coup\" against him.  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, sent letters to the heads of the top intelligence agencies on Friday asking to be briefed on what requests Barr has made to declassify national security secrets. Last week, Sen. Warner, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman, sent a similar letter using intelligence community leaders to inform the House and Senate Intelligence Committees if Barr's efforts threatened their agencies, and expressed concern that the review could \"chill the willingness of sources to work with the United States.\" With the latest news and analysis from Washington, don't miss Margaret Brennan (@margbrennan) this Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" (@FaceTheNation).

Beto O'Rourke introduced a sweeping voting rights proposal on Wednesday that aims to increase registration by 50 million, with the goal of boosting voter turnout to 65 percent.  The plan also calls for term limits for some federal offices, including an 18-year term limit for Supreme Court justices. Several 2020 candidates have called for reforming the high court in response to recent federal and local decisions, and vacancies that have shifted the ideological makeup of the judiciary.  The former Texas congressman will discuss the new plan and his standing in the 2020 presidential primary in an exclusive interview with Elaine Quijano on CBSN Wednesday evening.  O'Rourke's plan would establish Election Day as a national holiday and implement same-day and automatic voter registration, including pre-registration for 15- and 16-year-olds. His proposal also includes these initiatives: O'Rourke would also call on Congress to pass legislation that allows people without identification to vote. He's also proposing a constitutional amendment to institute a 12-year term limit for both the House and Senate, in an effort to inspire more people to run for office. The proposal comes as O'Rourke has sought to reboot his campaign, after he faced criticism early on for a lack of policy plans. Recently, O'Rourke introduced other proposals related to immigration and climate change.\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "In a spirited campaign rally Monday night, a bullish President Trump called on his fervent supporters in rural Pennsylvania to mobilize for his reelection bid, telling them he could potentially serve a fifth term in the White House with their help. \"We ran one time and we're '1-and-0' \u2014 but it was for the big one. Now we're going to have a second time. And we're going to have another one. And then we'll drive them crazy,\" the president told the raucous crowd in the small town of Montoursville in central Pennsylvania.\u00a0 \"Maybe if we really like it a lot \u2014 and if things keep going like they're going \u2014 we'll go and we'll do what we have to do: we'll do a three and a four and a five,\" he added, presumably referring to subsequent terms in office. The 22nd Amendment of the Constitution bars individuals from serving as president for more than two terms. Before the amendment was ratified in 1951, Franklin D. Roosevelt was the only president to stay in office for more than two terms. Mr. Trump also slammed Democrats in Congress and those running for the nomination to challenge him next year, calling them \"socialist wackos\" and accusing them of having a fringe agenda antithetical to the values and economic interests of rural communities. He claimed Democrats support lax immigration enforcement, late-term abortion, the destruction of the Second Amendment, expensive initiatives to mitigate climate change and unfair trade deals.\u00a0 Before Mr. Trump's poll-defying victory in 2016, the last Republican to carry Pennsylvania   was President George. H. W. Bush in 1988. Knowing that its coveted 20 electoral votes will be key to thwarting the president's reelection, some Democratic presidential candidates have also made flipping Pennsylvania a priority. Last week, former Vice President Joe Biden, the early front-runner in the Democratic primary race, officially\u00a0kicked off his campaign\u00a0in Philadelphia, where his campaign headquarters is located. Speaking on stage, Pennsylvania state Rep. Fred Keller, who Mr. Trump is backing in a special election Tuesday for the 12th Congressional District, underscored the importance of the state for the\u00a0president's electoral prospects. \u00a0 \"In 2016, Pennsylvania put President Trump over the top. In 2020, we're going to do it again,\" Keller told the crowd, provoking chants of \"USA!\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey that aired Sunday, April 21, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" BOB SCHIEFFER: You may have noticed \u2013 we hope you noticed \u2013 that last week Face the Nation was off the air due to the Masters golf tournament. But here at the broadcast, we did not stop working. After New Jersey Senator Cory Booker officially announced he was running for the Democratic nomination last Saturday, Margaret Brennan caught up with him in Newark. MARGARET BRENNAN: You think there's too much infighting in the Democratic Party right now? SEN. CORY BOOKER: I think that we have - and saw in the last election - people- a lot of infighting that- that undermined our ability to win that election. I plan on being the nominee, but if I'm not, I'm going to make sure that we unify behind whoever is there. Because again, we can't fight each other, and as opposed to unifying each other, which was going to make us stronger. And so in this election- this is why I talk about things like grace. Why I start talking about things about a more courageous empathy for one another. Because there are definitely a politics in this country that believes that they will do better if they can divide us against each other. I'm going to run a race, not getting down into the gutter, not trying to fight darkness with darkness. I'm calling to a more courageous empathy, a more - a revival of civic grace, for us to get us back to what I think patriotism is. MARGARET BRENNAN: New Jersey is a pharmaceutical hub. SEN. BOOKER: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've signed on to Bernie Sanders' proposal of this \"Medicare for All\" bill. What happens to all those companies and people employed by those touching the insurance or drug industries? SEN. BOOKER: We share a value in America, and that's where we should always start, our common values, that nobody in this country should go bankrupt because they get sick or put aside lifesaving drugs because they can't afford them. That's a value I think all Americans share. So now the question is how do we get there? I think the best way to get there is \"Medicare for all.\" But there are a lot of pathways to get to that end, and we've got to start now. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what happens though to the private insurance companies and to the private pharmaceutical companies under your vision of this-- SEN. BOOKER: Under my presidency-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --plan. SEN. BOOKER: --well hopefully in my first hundred days we're going to put forward having a public option for Americans. That means doing things like lowering Medicare eligibility down to 55, which by the way would actually lower costs for even the private insurance because you'd see more older people moving out. Number two, one of the biggest drivers to health care costs in this country is the price of those pharmaceutical drugs. It's unacceptable. So we would use the power of Medicare to negotiate down costs. MARGARET BRENNAN: But this doesn't mean doing away with private health insurance. This doesn't mean the government's setting drug prices. SEN. BOOKER: Listen, we live in a country where-- of 180 million Americans have private insurance and are satisfied with their insurance, and we have unions who have negotiated for their insurance rates. Anybody that's going to come forward with a bold health care plan has to show what the pathway to getting there is. And the first way we can start to earn trust on that way is to create a viable public option. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is Cory Booker's immigration plan? Do you accept that there's a humanitarian crisis? SEN. BOOKER: I- I accept that there's a humanitarian crisis that is being caused by this president. There is a humanitarian crisis when you throw children into cages and separate families. That's a human rights violation. We can keep our country safe and strong and honor human rights as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you do with the record number of family units that are crossing? SEN. BOOKER: Well, first of all, Donald Trump's not even listening to his own people. You- you have-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well what does Cory Booker do? SEN. BOOKER: Well, I'll tell you what Cory Booker does- the exact opposite of what he's doing. You have a president that is not supporting those places where it's sourcing the immigration in the first place. We do lots of foreign aid from Africa to- to- to th- the- the Middle East. We should be making sure that those countries that are going through crises that are causing all this immigration that we're doing more to intervene, to support human rights and basic dignity in those countries. That's a lower cost way to do- to deal with it than to have the horrors of these families with small children trying to make thousands of miles journey to come through our borders. And at our border, we need to make sure that we have an asylum system that actually works as Republicans and Democrats designed that asylum system to work. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is your view on how the attorney general has described what he has said was spying on the Trump campaign? SEN. BOOKER: For the attorney general of the United States of America to make such a claim, back it up with no evidence whatsoever, de-legitimized his position as an independent- he's not the president's attorney general. He's the attorney general for the United States of America. The highest law enforcement officer in the land. I think what he did was unfortunate and eroded even more of the trust the American people should have in their attorney general.

            "article_content": "Beto O'Rourke formally kicked off his presidential campaign with three rallies across his home state of Texas, where he came close enough to upsetting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz to generate the national buzz now buoying his 2020 White House bid. The Democratic ex-congressman held a Saturday rally mere blocks from the U.S.-Mexico border in his native El Paso, then traveling to historically black Texas Southern University in Houston before an evening event in the shadow of Austin's state Capitol. He stood on a dais surrounded by supporters holding signs and flags, who would occasionally break out in chants of \"Beto, Beto!\" O'Rourke emphasized the multicultural nature of El Paso, calling it a \"city of asylum seekers and immigrants.\" His speech was in direct contradiction to rallies with President Trump, who has made building a wall on the southern border the signature promise of his administration. O'Rourke promised to help Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children. However, he also indicated support for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which some Democrats have called for abolishing. O'Rourke also pointed to his Senate campaign as evidence that Texas was becoming a more Democratic-leaning state. \"This state and its 38 electoral votes count like they have never counted before,\" O'Rourke said, his voice raspy from strain. He also outlined his platform from that of Mr. Trump's. \"For too long in this country, the powerful have maintained their privilege at the expense of the powerless,\" O'Rourke said, accusing the president of campaigning on \"fear and division\" in order to make Americans \"angry and afraid.\" \"Let's agree: before we are anything else, we are Americans first,\" O'Rourke said. He listed policy priorities like universal health care, although he indicated that he does not support eliminating private health insurance, distinguishing himself from candidates who support Medicare-for-All like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. He called for improving education and paying teachers better wages, as well as strengthening unions. O'Rourke also addressed racial discrimination, and called for legalizing recreational marijuana, ending cash bail, and \"confronting the legacy of slavery and segregation.\" O'Rourke did not explicitly voice support for reparations. He compared addressing climate change to Americans rising to the challenge of World War II. \"We have to once again reassert our role on the world stage,\" O'Rourke said. He also briefly spoke in Spanish, to cheers. In his second rally at Texas Southern University in Houston, O'Rourke focused on lowering the cost of tuition and student loan debt. He also highlighted increasing teacher salaries and overall national wages, including increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. \"People from all communities who are struggling, when I talk about those kids who are 10-12 months back, it's kids whose moms cant read to them because of their jobs,\" O'Rourke said. \"We must win fight for $15 an hour. Must make sure, instead of allowing unions to be diminished, that we strengthen them. Make sure they're college ready, and career ready to allow them to have dignity and purpose and real paycheck. \" O'Rourke only mentioned Mr. Trump's name at the very end, when he said the election is not solely about defeating Mr. Trump but also uniting the country.\u00a0 O'Rourke held his third rally in Austin, with the state Capitol building as a backdrop, and where O'Rourke nearly 74 percent of the vote in his losing campaign for Senate against Ted Cruz.\u00a0 In Austin, O'Rourke highlighted some of his policy positions, including debt-free college, universal background checks for guns, legalizing marijuana and reinstating the Voting Rights Act.\u00a0 O'Rourke has visited nine states since joining the race on March 14, though he promised to head home for an official launch. As O'Rourke lost his Senate race, albeit narrowly, and currently holds no political position, some Democrats have questioned whether he has the experience to run for president. He addressed the concerns in an interview with Gayle King on \"CBS This Morning\" earlier this month. \"I guess it depends on what kind of experience you're looking for,\" he said. \"I've got experience hiring people, creating jobs, developing the economy of the community in which I live. Serving in local government, with Amy helping to raise a family and finding ways to work across the aisle, to get legislation passed even when I'm in the minority party.\" A recent poll of Iowa Democrats put O'Rourke in fifth place, behind former Vice President Joe Biden -- expected to join the race in the near future -- and three senators. In a national Quinnipiac poll of Democratic voters released on Thursday, O'Rourke placed third, behind Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Texas is America's largest red state, but Democrats aren't writing it off in 2020. Another presidential candidate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, drew large crowds at a rally at Texas Southern University last weekend.",

            "article_content": "President Trump addressed the Jewish Republican Coalition's Annual Leadership Meeting on Saturday, delivering a speech after recently accusing Democrats of being \"anti-Jewish\" and \"anti-Israel.\" He spoke at the Venetian Resort, owned by Sheldon Adelson, a prominent Republican donor and strong Trump supporter, who received a standing ovation at the meeting. Mr. Trump began his speech by jokingly thanking Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. Omar was criticized for making comments about Israel, which some called anti-Semitic. She later apologized for her comments.\u00a0 \"I almost forgot, she doesn't like Israel. I'm so sorry!\" Mr. Trump said, as her name was booed. He also talked about Republican electoral wins, praising their moderate gains in the Senate and maintaining several governorships. He also touted wins in the House, although Democrats gained an overwhelming majority in 2018. \"We get no credit. Fake news. We get no credit, let's keep winning,\" he said. He later claimed that the Democrats had allowed the \"scourge\" of anti-Semitism to enter the party. Mr. Trump quickly pivoted to talking about his support for Israel, and his dissolution of the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor. \"How the hell did you support President Obama? How the hell did you support the Democrats? Well, you guys didn't,\" Mr. Trump joked, alluding to how the majority of Jewish Americans support Democratic candidates. \"The incredible bond between the United States and Israel has never been stronger than it is right now.\" Trump spent most of the speech touting his administration's accomplishments, and in particular the confirmation of conservative justices to the federal bench. He also discussed his administration's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and the decision to\u00a0move the American embassy\u00a0there from Tel Aviv. Mr. Trump joked that world leaders would call him about the move, which was globally unpopular, and he said he waited to reply to their calls until after he had announced it. The president also raised his administration's decision last month to recognize the Golan Heights as Israeli territory, a controversial move that has not been backed by other countries.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has made his support for Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a key part of his appeal to Jewish voters. Several attendees at the meeting Saturday were wearing red yarmulkes emblazoned with \"Trump\" and \"RJC.\" Netanyahu -- who has been indicted on corruption charges -- is running for his third term, and the election is on Tuesday. Trump jokingly asked the audience at the meeting how the election was going, and who they thought would win. The crowd replied with cheers of \"Bibi,\" Netanyahu's nickname. The president's trip to Las Vegas comes after he toured a stretch of the southern border in California on Friday and made controversial comments about asylum seekers, disparaging asylum as a \"scam\" and a \"hoax.\" \"I look at some of these asylum people, they're gang members,\" he said. \"They're not afraid of anything. They have lawyers greeting them. They read what lawyers tell them to read.\" \"The system is full. We can't take you anymore. Whether it's asylum. Whether it's anything you want. It's illegal immigration,\" he continued, warning migrants away from seeking asylum. Mr. Trump reiterated this message in an interview with Griff Jenkins on \"Fox and Friends\" Saturday morning. \"There's never been so many people coming up and that's because they're gaming the system and the system is changed for the worse because of what happened with Democrats and what they've done in terms of Congress,\" Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump repeated these allegations during his speech Saturday. He also accused the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras of not doing enough to stop people from migrating to the U.S. -- which is why he directed the State Department to cut off aid to the three countries. Critics argue that cutting off aid would worsen the situation in these countries, driving more people to seek asylum. \"I've taken a lot of heat from the stupid people,\" about the decision to cut off aid, Mr. Trump said. \"What about building our own country for a change?\"\u00a0 He also reiterated threats to close down the border, which could be economically catastrophic for the country. \"I'll do whatever is necessary to stop an invasion of our country,\" he said.

            "article_content": "He may be the most polarizing figure in politics that no one votes for or against. As the executive chairman of Breitbart Media, and later the CEO for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Steve Bannon was the behind-the-scenes orchestrator for his chosen candidate's populist agenda, promoting divisive red-meat issues like immigration and demonizing the Democrats and centrist Republicans for the GOP base. His uncompromising win-at-any-cost attitude succeeded in burning the D.C. establishment by landing a political newbie in the White House. But he also burned bridges \u2013 the president was miffed when Time Magazine credited Bannon as \"The Great Manipulator,\" and Michael Wolff made prodigious use of his access to Bannon's criticisms of key administration figures in his book \"Fire and Fury.\" Bannon would depart the White House in January 2018, seeking new worlds to conquer.  For the engrossing new fly-on-the-wall documentary \"The Brink\" (which recently premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and opens in select cities Friday), filmmaker Alison Klayman obtained remarkable access to Bannon and his inner circle, trailing the political maestro for more than a year as he embarked on a new international initiative to bring the same fire and fury to populist political organizations in Europe, with mixed results.  Bannon is also seen trying to repeat the Republicans' 2016 wins in the 2018 midterms (which he called President Trump's first re-election bid), when a brewing \"blue wave\" threatened to recapture control of the House for the Democrats. We see him auditioning populist candidates to run as standard-bearers of Trump in GOP primaries, bestowing his blessing upon those deemed the most media-savvy. We also see Bannon as a debater pleased with his standing as a GOP star demonstrably taking credit for the 45th president's victory, and as a dispenser of realpolitik to access journalists hovering within view or within easy reach via speed dial.  In \"The Brink\" he is remarkably unfiltered when discussing his motives and strategies, as is nearly everyone. (Only Erik Prince, the Blackwater founder and Trump advisor, comments that he has to watch what he says before Klayman's microphones.) Despite his characterization among late-night comedians as a racist firebreather who wears too many shirts, Bannon comes across as a jovial and inviting raconteur, eager to pull his audience into an exclusive club. He is adept (and maybe a little greedy) in taking the spotlight at Republican fundraisers, where he skewers Democrats and the \"liberal elites\" while portraying conservative elites (businesspeople, philanthropists) and their down-market followers (working and middle classes) as the real owners of American values.  He invokes Lincoln and speaks in lofty tomes of \"the battle,\" or of being a fighter on the ropes, relishing the honor of being a political pugilist who makes headlines, and for whom there is no bad PR. But from what we hear during Klayman's whirlwind tour, Bannon's worldview beyond the transactional tactics of winning and maintaining power at all costs is fairly blurry, given how possessed he is of the rules of engagement in inter- and intra-party fighting as compared to the implementation and long-term ramifications of social policy. He doesn't seem to care for the intricacies of fiscal policy, while he can find himself in the weeds with a web designer over the layout of an internet site (being so cognizant of its value as a media and marketing tool), or massaging a message that might shift the percentages of a focus group's feedback. Klayman's previous documentaries include \"Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry,\" about the Chinese artist-activist, and \"Take Your Pills,\" about the rising dependency upon cognitive-enhancing drugs like Adderall.\u00a0 With \"The Brink,\" she (not entirely dispassionately) observes Bannon operating the levers of media manipulation and sometimes (but not often) being challenged over his views and tactics.  She tails Bannon as he criss-crosses Europe to promote an amalgam of far-right populist politicians and parties, dubbed The Movement. He is heard proselytizing for a common agenda, casting refugees and immigrants as threats to the social order (which critics describe as white nationalist and neo-fascistic). To Bannon, he is \"doing the Lord's work\" by pushing nationalism as the antithesis of globalism, and selling \"euro-skepticism\" to attack the EU \"elites,\" but at times you almost wonder if he believes in it beyond the talking points, as long as the foot soldiers are riled up to take over electoral territory. He has no qualms about smashing the bonds forged by countries following World War II and the end of the Cold War, if it means forming new bonds that uphold a more narrow, exclusionary world view. His success in the United States at elevating a man espousing anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric attracted some far-right figures who see Bannon as a visionary. But while The Movement gained adherents (like Britain's Nigel Farage and Italy's Matteo Salvini), Bannon also received pushback from players who did not want American influence in European politics, and he discovered that campaign finance laws in Europe are wildly inconsistent with regards to money from foreign sources, tying his hands in some cases. (And just who is funding The Movement? When queried, the on-camera subjects suddenly become mousey quiet. Huh.) When The Guardian reporter Paul Lewis takes Bannon to task over allying his operations with neo-fascists in Italy with the goal of normalizing them, their discussion devolves over the definition of neo-fascism. Words, of course, have power, and Bannon knows better than most how the choice and inflection of words can move the dial from blue to red and back again.  The film makes clear that Bannon relishes the fight. After a contentious appearance on a British morning chat show in which interviewer Susanna Reid rakes him over the coals on the Muslim ban and President Trump's remarks following the violence in Charlottesville, he can't stop talking about how tough she was, admiring her tenacity. Even though he may not have come off looking well, he realizes it was riveting television. The disruptor had done his duty.  For her part, Klayman keeps her editorial distance \u2013 she rarely interjects questions or comments upon the proceedings that her camera documents \u2013 though she does parry with Bannon on a few occasions when his comments seem to cross the boundary of constitutional ideals. And while he is at first resistant to Klayman labeling his movie about the president's 2016 campaign (\"Trump@War\") as \"propaganda,\" recognizing it as a pejorative, he later eagerly uses the term himself when describing the film and its purpose, even raising the name of Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl when discussing its merits. And it was obviously effective for its intended audience; one woman who attends a GOP fundraiser glowingly praises it, admiring how \"un-propaganda\" it is.  Bannon therefore turns the war of social principles into a war of propaganda, in which one woman's nihilistic screed is another's affirmation of moral attitudes. And on that emotional (rather than intellectual) battleground, the Disruptor in Chief finds a fertile field for dividing and conquering.  There has been a large number of recent documentaries and series (including \"The Final Year,\" \"The Circus,\" \"Get Me Roger Stone\" and \"The Fourth Estate\") that show the backroom dealings, media manipulation and gamesmanship in contemporary politics. As informative as these films may be, watching how the partisan sausages get made has perhaps never been so distressingly taxing. Yet, \"The Brink\" is a very effective example of the genre in part because the character of Steve Bannon appears as both protagonist and antagonist. He's a field marshal offensively directing flanks of troops to conquer territory, and also welcoming incoming fire if it means using up his opponents' ammunition.  And Klayman can claim a great measure of success; she spent more than a year with Steve Bannon, and survived! And out of her marathon came a document that helps explain how the bloody cudgel of political ideas is often wielded nowadays, sometimes effectively and successfully, but always leaving decorum and comity tied up and gagged. The film also offers a lesson in how, come Election Night 2018, such strong-arm tactics, even in the hands of a master, could fail spectacularly.  \"The Brink,\" distributed by Magnolia Pictures, opens in select theatres in New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., on March 29, and expands to Chicago, San Francisco and other cities beginning in April. The film is not rated. 92 mins.  To watch a trailer for \"The Brink\" click on the video player below. See also:  David Morgan is a senior editor at CBSNews.com and cbssundaymorning.com.",

            "article_content": "President Trump's attorney Jay Sekulow says that Congress needs to move on from its ongoing probes into the president's alleged ties to the Russian government in light of Special counsel Robert Mueller concluding that the Trump campaign did not \"conspire or coordinate\" with the Russian government in its interference of the 2016 presidential election. Sekulow told \"CBS This Morning\" on Monday that while the special counsel's probe has ended, ongoing congressional investigations are a \"waste of money\" and slammed their inquiries as \"political.\"\u00a0 \"Let's get on with the people's business,\" Sekulow said, highlighting the need for unresolved legislative issues like immigration reform to take precedence over the Russia investigation.  \"There's lot of good things that can happen in Congress...the idea that there's going to be these ongoing congressional oversight hearings on something that's been delved into,\" said Sekulow, citing the numerous subpoenas and search warrants carried out over the 22 month-long investigation.\u00a0 Currently, House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff has expanded the parameters of his committee's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Rep. Jerry Nadler, chair of House Judiciary, has launched an extensive investigation into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey. In early March, the Judiciary Committee\u00a0requested documents\u00a0from 81 entities and individuals, from the White House to Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. The U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York has also launched investigations into Mr. Trump and the Trump organization. Meanwhile, Sekulow, who has been a member of the president's legal team throughout the nearly two-year long investigation, said he was \"glad\" Mueller concluded his investigation, saying \"we can move forward as a country.\" The special counsel's office did not come to a conclusion on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, instead leaving it to the attorney general to determine whether Mr. Trump's actions constituted a crime. \"While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\" Mueller's report read.In light of those findings, Sekulow said that the Department of Justice appropriately \"looked at the facts and the law\" present in the case.  \"They reviewed these difficult questions of law and facts...and made the conclusion there was no obstruction of justice, there was no underlying crime being obstructed and there was not sufficient evidence \u00a0for an obstruction claim,\" Sekulow explained.\u00a0 Sekulow said the administration is now urging \"as much transparency\" as the attorney general feels he can provide. He said he trusted Barr to \"do the right thing\" in disclosing as much as he can \"without compromising national security.\" Barr said in a letter to lawmakers on Sunday that his intent is to release \"as much\" of report as consistent with law.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke announced he is running for president, making it official with an online video released Thursday morning. Seated on a couch next to his wife, O'Rourke announced, \"Amy and I are happy to share with you that I am running to serve you as the next president of the United States of America.\"  He said that the crises in our economy, democracy and climate \"will either consume us or they will afford us the greatest opportunity to unleash the genius of the United States of America.\" O'Rourke went through a list of Democratic priorities, including health care, climate change, family separation and criminal justice reform, gesturing or chopping with his hands to emphasize each point.  O'Rourke said he plans to travel the country and \"listen to those who I seek to serve, to understand from your perspective how we can best meet these challenges.\"  And he finished the 3 1/2-minute video by saying, \"The only way for us to live up to the promise of America is to give it our all and give it for all of us. We are truly now, more than ever, the last great hope of Earth.  \"At this moment of maximum peril and maximum potential let's show ourselves and those who will succeed us in this great country just who we are and what we can do.\"  I am running to serve you as the next president. The challenges we face are the greatest in living memory. No one person can meet them on their own. Only this country can do that, and only if we build a movement that includes all of us. Say you're in: https://t.co/EKLdkVET2u pic.twitter.com/lainXyvG2n The bid comes 3 1/2 months after a narrow loss for Senate in Texas, a campaign that catapulted the 46-year-old, three-term lawmaker from El Paso to national prominence.  O'Rourke is heading to Iowa for several campaign events, including a stop at Northern Iowa University to stump for Eric Giddens, who is running for a special election for a state Senate seat. At the end of the month, on March 30, O'Rourke plans to return to El Paso to kick off his campaign.\u00a0  The former congressman had been testing the waters for a presidential run in unconventional ways. He took a solo road trip through the Southwest earlier this year, documenting his travels in a series of Medium posts reminiscent of Jack Kerouac. He used Instagram and Facebook to stream conversations with people in his neighborhood and life, including a now famous stop at the dentist.   On the day of President Trump's State of the Union address to Congress in February, O'Rourke sat down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey, and said he was thinking about running for president.  And when Mr. Trump visited El Paso last month to talk about border security, O'Rourke held a dueling rally that captured the attention of the current commander in chief.  O'Rourke has an influential social media presence and demonstrated a grassroots fundraising prowess in his unsuccessful Senate bid, raising a whopping $80 million. He collected endorsements in that race from the likes of Beyonce and Lebron James, fueling interest from the national media and drawing comparisons to John F. Kennedy. He has the potential to tap into various constituencies and, as the El Paso rally demonstrated, a willingness to take on the president.  The nominating process will test whether O'Rourke can translate that kind of support and star power to a different kind of campaign, one in which he'll be competing against other popular Democrats, not an opponent like Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.   The White House run will also prompt greater scrutiny of his policy proposals and track record in Congress. In an interview with the Washington Post in January, O'Rourke struggled to define his solutions for key immigration issues, even though he represented a district along the border. In an interview with MSNBC last month, he said he would support taking down an existing border wall in El Paso.  On Wednesday, just hours before his presidential announcement, Vanity Fair published a cover story profile of O'Rourke, complete with photos by legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz. In an interview for the piece, the former congressman talked about his presidential ambitions. \"I want to be in it.\" he told the magazine. \"Man, I'm just born to be in it, and want to do everything I humanly can for this country at this moment.\"  The \"born to be in it\" comment has already garnered some backlash on social media, as issues of inequality and privilege are being debated in what is already the most crowded and diverse Democratic primary field in recent history.  O'Rourke addressed criticism he would likely face as a white male in a field that already comprises women, African Americans, a latino and a gay millennial. \"The government at all levels is overly represented by white men,\" he told Vanity Fair. \"That's part of the problem, and I'm a white man. So if I were to run, I think it's just so important that those who would comprise my team looked like this country.\"  He continued: \"But I totally understand people who will make a decision based on the fact that almost every single one of our presidents has been a white man, and they want something different for this country. And I think that's a very legitimate basis upon which to make a decision. Especially in the fact that there are some really great candidates out there right now.\"  \"CBS This Morning\" co-anchor Gayle King will speak with O'Rourke for his only national TV interview following his 2020 announcement, Friday on \"CBS This Morning\" (7 to 9 a.m. ET/PT) Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Caracas, Venezuela \u2014 Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 shrouded the route and timing of his return in secrecy amid concerns he might be detained by Venezuela's government. Yet he breezed through airport immigration checks and brazenly called for the downfall of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro at a rally where the presence of security forces was minimal. Guaid\u00f3's homecoming Monday was the latest chapter in his struggle with Maduro, who has been warned by the United States and other countries not to move against his adversary and possibly realized arresting his foe could generate more street protests. And, while Guaid\u00f3's presence is likely to add at least short-term momentum to his campaign for political change, Maduro has proven resilient and still commands the critical loyalty of top military officers. Venezuela is gripped by a humanitarian crisis that is expected to worsen as U.S. oil sanctions designed to put more pressure on Maduro take their toll. With both political factions holding firm amid increasing deprivation for Venezuelans, some analysts speculate that they might be considering negotiations on an end to the standoff. The fact that Guaid\u00f3 was not detained, at least so far, reflects the pressure Maduro faces not to intervene, said Luis Vicente Leon, head of the Caracas-based polling firm Datanalisis. \"But it seems to indicate the beginning of a negotiation, local and international, whose details are not yet clear,\" Leon said in a tweet. For now, Guaid\u00f3, leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, seems intent on probing Maduro's socialist government for vulnerabilities, saying he would meet Tuesday with public employee unions in an attempt to secure their cooperation. He also called for big protests on Saturday, a tactic that has sometimes been countered by Maduro loyalists with flag-waving rallies of their own. On Monday, Guaid\u00f3 showed off his passport before climbing onto scaffolding and pumping his fist during the demonstration in Caracas, delighting euphoric followers. There was no immediate comment from Maduro's government, which sought to focus the public's attention on Carnival festivities Monday and Tuesday. Still, while thousands of Venezuelans heeded Guaid\u00f3's call for protests coinciding with his return, many worry the government might crack down on the opposition as it has in the past, jailing or driving into exile top opposition leaders. \"We know the risks that we face. That's never stopped us,\" Guaid\u00f3 said. He was greeted at the country's main airport by top diplomats from the United States, Germany, Spain and other countries who possibly hoped to head off any move to detain Guaid\u00f3 by bearing witness to his return. \"We hope there won't be any escalation and that parliamentary immunity is respected,\" said Spanish Ambassador Jesus Silva Fernandez. The United States and some 50 other countries have recognized Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, arguing that Maduro's re-election last year was invalid because popular opposition candidates were barred from running. Maduro has accused those nations of participating in a U.S.-backed coup plot against him. Guaid\u00f3, who left Venezuela last month despite a court order banning him from foreign travel, visited Colombia, Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and Ecuador. The governments of those countries support his claim to be Venezuela's interim president and have urged Maduro to resign so the country can prepare for free and fair elections. The United States congratulated the opposition leader on his return home. \"The international community must unite and push for the end of Maduro's brutal regime and the peaceful restoration of democracy in Venezuela,\" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.",

With the anticipated upcoming release of special counsel Robert Mueller's final report, ongoing probes by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York into President Trump's businesses and Democrats in control of the House, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon predicts 2019 will be a \"vitriolic\" and \"nasty\" year in American politics.\u00a0 \"I think that 2019 is going to be the most vitriolic year in American politics since before the Civil War,\" Bannon said in an interview with CBS News correspondent Seth Doane on Saturday. \"And I include Vietnam in that. I think we're in, I think we're in for a very nasty 2019.\" Bannon, who helped the president mount an unexpectedly successful populist White House bid during the 2016 campaign cycle before tapped for a White House post, said the president will face increased scrutiny this year, both from federal investigators and Democrats seeking to thwart his reelection. \"I think the next 90 days to four months is going to be a real meat grinder ... I mean, the pressure on the president is coming from many different angles,\" he said, adding later, \"I think you've already seen it from what the Democrats, some of these reports they've been dropping here without telling anybody. I think that now they control the House they can weaponize this, they could weaponize the Mueller report.\" Bannon said he also expects the president to face primary challenges from more centrist and moderate Republicans. Some high-profile Republicans, including Maryland's popular Gov. Larry Hogan, are mulling bids to mount insurgent campaigns against the incumbent president. Still, Bannon said Mr. Trump will be \"in a much more battle-hardened position\" as result of the political challenges he expects to besiege the White House in the coming months.\u00a0 After being pushed out of the administration in the summer of 2017 by former White House chief of staff John Kelly \u2014 reportedly for influencing Mr. Trump's decision to denounce \"many sides\" for the deadly Charlottesville rally by white supremacists \u2014 Bannon has been advising far-right political campaigns in the U.S. and Europe. \"I think what people like myself and others, and maybe to the right of the president and more China hawks, is to say, 'It's imperative, we think, on March 1 to go to the next round of tariffs, to increase the tariffs. You will put additional pressure on the Chinese.' The president, as a negotiator, I think essentially has said, 'Hey, I think we can get there. I think we can get the six different areas we can move them forward. We're not going to have deals on March 1. But I'm prepared to work with President Xi.' It's just a different negotiating style. [...] \"Remember, China has gamed the system over 25 years. I mean, if you look at this, there's a book out there, 'Unrestricted Warfare,' that I know you're familiar with, that lays out the Chinese plan over 25 years about information war, economic war and kinetic war. They said, 'We can take the West on economically.' The Chinese have tremendous levers. I mean, listen, essentially as a country, right, as a great power, our elites had given up.\u00a0 \"Not Democrats and Republicans, but the elites combined had kind of given up on us ever getting our manufacturing base back from China. In fact, they shipped it over there. Donald Trump's pivot and I think this is why the new NAFTA deal is so important, to set up North America both Mexico, Canada and the United States as a geo-strategic manufacturing arm to bring the supply chain, the high value, add a supply chain back from Asia.\" \"I think the most interesting thing that's happening right now in politics is how far to the left some of these candidates that are running for president of the Democrat Party are being pulled on some of the policies you're talking about. I think it's, I think how that plays in the general election is to be seen but I'm pretty shocked about how far they are being pulled. [...] \"I've always said I think there will be someone that comes forward, whether it's Schultz or Bloomberg, and says, 'Hey, Trump is too far to the right with this kind of,' they'll argue he has a nativist, xenophobic, you know, America-first isolationist attitude. In the left is democratic socialism: 'I will be the one-time savior of the country and try to pull together something in the middle.'\u00a0 \"I think it's interesting that the attacks immediately didn't come from the right, didn't come from Trump, but that you really saw a wall of lead come down on Schultz who's a pretty, I think, liberal Democrat.\" Doane:\u00a0\"Ann Coulter called the president an idiot over his stance on the wall. How do you think this plays with his base?\" Bannon: \"I think the base is bifurcated into two. I think there is a section of the base that's quite concerned about what was signed in this appropriations bill. You know, you have this thing about the unaccompanied minors that is going to be quite controversial, about whether there was an amnesty grant or not. There's also these issues about what local authorities, what types of power they have over, to actually stop or what types of consultation they have, rights they have with the chief executive over actually building the wall. So I think we'll have to see all that.\u00a0 \"You know, look, Ann provides a function. She is actually out there as kind of the spokesman or someone, you know, and she doesn't play by the Marquis of Queensbury rules. She's very, you know, she's very pointed in how she says it. I know she supports the president, but in this regard I think she brings up some good points that the president \u2014 and particularly the staff around him, I'm not so sure he was that well-served in these negotiations about the details of what was actually in the immigration part of this.\u00a0 \"And I think Ann has done a good job of trying to bring those up so people can understand it. It's not that, people, the base, don't support the president. But remember, the president came with an agenda. That agenda was dealing with massive illegal immigration and also dealing with legal immigration. That's what his supporters want to see and want to make sure that he's focused on it to the degree they can help him for that agenda.\u00a0 \"So I wouldn't take this personally from Ann Coulter. I actually think the president should look at that as something as trying to be constructive in trying to help further his agenda.\" Correction: Due to an editing error, a previous headline on this article incorrectly stated Bannon said he expects 2019 to be the most vitriolic year in politics \"since the Civil War,\" not \"since before the Civil War.\"\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "A Belarusian model who claimed last year that she had evidence of Russian involvement in helping elect Donald Trump president was deported from Thailand on Thursday, police said. Anastasia Vashukevich along with seven co-defendants pleaded guilty this week in a case related to holding a sex training seminar in Thailand. They were arrested almost a year ago in the seaside resort town of Pattaya, which is especially popular with Russian tourists. Thailand's immigration police chief Lt. Gen. Surachate Hakparn said most of the group left on flights shortly after noon, those going to Russia on one flight and those headed to Belarus on another. Vashukevich and at least one of the other deportees hold passports from Belarus. While in custody, Vashukevich claimed to have recordings of Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska talking about interference in the 2016 U.S. election, but never released them. Deripaska is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and also had a working relationship with Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign manager who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller and convicted last year of tax and bank fraud. Earlier this month, Manafort's lawyers accidentally revealed in a court filing that Mueller has evidence Manafort shared polling data with an associate linked to Russian intelligence during the 2016 campaign. The associate is Konstantin Kilimnik, who worked closely with Manafort for years promoting Russian-backed Ukrainian interests. As CBS News Washington correspondent Paula Reid reported, it was the first time a Trump official had been accused of sharing campaign information with Russian interests. Vashukevich \u2014 also known on social media as Nastya Rybka \u2014 and her co-defendants were convicted of soliciting and conspiracy and given suspended 18-month prison terms. The group had said that they were conducting a class on sexual relationships. Surachate said Russian self-styled sex guru Alexander Kirillov, Vashukevich's mentor in the sex training business, would take a Thursday night flight because no more seats were available earlier. In the early stages of their detention, the sex training group sent a note to the U.S. Embassy via an intermediary seeking help and political asylum. Vashukevich indicated she would turn over the recordings she claimed to have if the U.S. could help secure her release, but later withdrew the offer, suggesting that she and Deripaska had reached an agreement. A public scandal erupted in early February last year when Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny published an investigation drawing on Vashukevich's social media posts suggesting corrupt links between Deripaska and a top Kremlin official, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Prikhodko. The investigative report featured video from Deripaska's yacht in 2016, when Vashukevich, who has also worked as an escort, was aboard. On Wednesday in Washington, the U.S. Senate narrowly upheld a Treasury Department decision to lift sanctions from three companies connected to Deripaska. The Treasury Department said the Russian companies have committed to separating from Deripaska, who will remain blacklisted as part of an array of measures announced in early April that targeted tycoons close to the Kremlin. Deripaska was one of 24 Russian officials and tycoons faced with sanctions imposed by the United States last year as Washington stepped up its condemnation of Russia's actions in recent years, including its 2014 annexation of Crimea, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, hacking attacks and meddling in Western elections. The metals tycoon controls a business empire with assets in aluminum, energy and construction and is worth $5.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine.",

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to this Washington Post report before we talk about the shutdown. It- it says that the president has tried to conceal the substance of his conversations with Vladimir Putin, even taking away the notes from his translator who sat in- the interpreter in the room during their talks. Does it concern you that there's no public record of what the president discussed with Vladimir Putin, the leader of the country that interfered in the 2016 elections? LEADER McCARTHY: Well Margret, what I do know is what this administration, this Congress has done. We've been very tough on Russia. Look at the sanctions that we have taken. With this administration: one, on the election meddling that Russia has done, the movement of Russia with inside Ukraine as well. And I just listened to the president last night. He's more than willing to have an open to what that discussion was about he said on a news show last night. But I know what the president likes to do. He likes to create a personal relationship, build that relationship, even rebuild that relationship like he does with other world leaders around-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But this was keeping the record of the conversation from the national security adviser. The person who is supposed to be the top adviser to the president. LEADER McCARTHY: Well in hearing the president last night on the show, he says he was more than willing to let that information go out. So that's what I know right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does congress want to see any of this? Or speak to the interpreter? LEADER McCARTHY: I'd like to the president to be able to build these relationships. I know this administration. I know this Congress is very tough on Russia. And we will continue to be so. But I want this president to be able to build a relationship, even on a personal level with all the world leaders as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you speak to the President, have you ever asked him about this? LEADER McCARTHY: I haven't asked about this situation yet because it just came out. But I did talk to the president yesterday about the shutdown. I know this president is focused on giving this government open. That's why the president is here. That's why I'm here in Washington. The challenge has been from the very beginning. The president has made numerous offers about this shutdown. Reasonable too, moving further to the Democratic side. And there has not been one offer coming back from the Democrats. It is unacceptable that 800,000 U.S. employees are not being paid. You know what we're arguing over? One-tenth of one percent of the federal budget. And it's not as though we're asking Democrats to do something they haven't done before. They voted for border wall and fencing. We have Democrats, even the new progressives from California. Katie Hill, said she would vote for a wall. You had the chairman-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I think the barrier- defining the barrier is the point that you're kind of stuck on right now. LEADER McCARTHY: I would take the language we had voted on before. The president even said he would add in no concrete-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fencing Act from 2006? LEADER McCARTHY: No. Just the appropriations bills that we've taken prior. That would allow us to do the job that needs to be done. You know the chairman of Armed Services, he actually says, \"Walls work\" and he was supportive of it. We had our own former president, President Obama in 2014 said there was a crisis on the border. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. LEADER McCARTHY: The new governor of California Gavin Newsom used it in his - in his inaugural address said there is a crisis along the border. The only people who believe there is not is Nancy- Speaker Pelosi-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well they agree-- LEADER McCARTHY: --and Senator Schumer. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in- in border security funding and offered one point three billion for that. It's the how it's spent that it seems to be you're disagreeing on-- LEADER McCARTHY: Well who-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- Let me-- LEADER McCARTHY: Well who in America believes in border security, doesn't have some form of a barrier? Because I've heard Democrats say they want a form of a barrier. The president has moved from a concrete to a steel barrier. So I've watched this president look for compromise. There just has been no compromise on the other side. MARGARET BRENNAN: But should you reopen the government while you have this argument? LEADER McCARTHY: We can have this government reopened. The president is correct. Less than 45 minutes-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would have-- LEADER McCARTHY: You know what. MARGARET BRENNAN: some sort of C.R. to open the government-- LEADER McCARTHY: I've been in- MARGARET BRENNAN: and then continue the immigration argument? LEADER McCARTHY: I've been in every single one of those meetings. I watched the president turn to Nancy Pelosi and say, \"OK if I reopen the government right now, in 30 days, could we have border security?\" She said, \"No. Not at all.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: You have-- LEADER McCARTHY: So that is the real challenge. Who is holding this government up? It's Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the- the federal government workers are the people paying the price right now. LEADER McCARTHY: They are. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have about 10,000 of them in your district-- LEADER McCARTHY: And that is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you tell them? LEADER McCARTHY: And that is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: When are they going to get paid? LEADER McCARTHY: That is unacceptable. That's why I'm here right now. I'm- I'm not in Puerto Rico. I'm here because I want to solve this problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you-- LEADER McCARTHY: And you know what-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you-- LEADER McCARTHY: Do you know what is happening- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a way to pay those workers while you continue-- LEADER McCARTHY: We have- MARGARET BRENNAN: --arguing over immigration? LEADER McCARTHY: We just voted- We just voted on Friday and sent it to the president. A law to make sure they are being paid when this is done. What we need to happen-- MARGARET BRENNAN: For those living paycheck to paycheck now matters. LEADER McCARTHY: Yeah, that's unacceptable. And where has the president been this whole time? What- what those constituents and what your viewers need to understand, before we ever got to this point when the Republicans had the House, they moved a bill to the Senate. In the Senate, it takes sixty votes. Senator Schumer would not come to a compromise. He would not even come for a vote. He left. When we sat during that break-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So should the president-- LEADER McCARTHY: --before the new swearing in-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you oppose the president declaring a national emergency? Since what you're describing sounds like you're not going anywhere. LEADER McCARTHY: You know what? MARGARET BRENNAN: Because he- he's-- LEADER McCARTHY: The Emergency Act exists-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --talked about possibly using money that would be allocated to California for disaster relief. LEADER McCARTHY: The-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's your home state. LEADER McCARTHY: The Emergency Act exists for these type of circumstances. But one thing I will tell you, we should solve this legislatively. I- I agree with what the president said on Friday, we need to solve this legislatively. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it sounds like-- LEADER McCARTHY: Because-- \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --you don't want-- LEADER McCARTHY: Listen, it's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --him to declare an emergency? LEADER McCARTHY: It's one tenth of one percent of the federal budget. If we cannot do this together, what else can we not do in the future? This is not that big of a problem. Democrats in the past have voted for fencing and for wall. Why, now, do they disagree? Because it's President Trump? I think the American public understands this. We can solve this in minutes and these- these workers should be able to be paid. It only takes a few minutes inside the meetings, but when the Democrats will not even make a counteroffer, it's unacceptable. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Iowa Republican Congressman Steve King. You called some of his language reckless when he, in an interview with the\u00a0New York Times, said the term, \"white nationalists\" and \"white supremacists,\" he didn't know when they became offensive. Some Republicans have come out very strongly here. Jeb Bush-- LEADER McCARTHY: As have- as have I. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Jeb Bush said it's not enough to condemn him, that party leaders actually have to do something. Either support a primary opponent to challenge him, others have said he should be at least censured. Should there be action against Congressman King? LEADER McCARTHY: First, and foremost, I came out at the very moment- that language has no place in America. That is not the America I know and it's most definitely not the party of Lincoln. MARGARET BRENNAN: Should he be-- LEADER McCARTHY: I have-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --punished for it? LEADER McCARTHY: I have a scheduled meeting with him on Monday, and I will tell you this: I've watched on the other side that they do not take action when their members say something like this. Action will be taken. I'm having a serious conversation with Congressman Steve King on his future and role in this Republican Party, because-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? LEADER McCARTHY: As a leader. There is a number of things you'll see that is taking place, but I will not stand back as a leader of this party, believing in this nation that all are created equal, that that stands or continues to stand and have any role with us. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, congressman.",

            "article_content": "The House on Tuesday passed a $1.4 trillion spending package that would fund federal agencies through September 2020 and avoid a government shutdown. The sweeping measure, which is divided into two legislative packages, now heads to the Senate to clear before government funding runs out at midnight on Friday. The package is the result of months of negotiations between Democrats, Republicans and the Trump administration. President Trump is expected to sign it.\u00a0 The first package, which is primarily focused on domestic spending, passed 297-120. The second package, which funds the Defense Department, passed 280-138.\u00a0 The $632 billion domestic measure provides more than Mr. Trump requested for the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. Meanwhile, it provides $738 billion in defense spending, which is less than the $750 billion the president proposed. The vote comes as Congress is wrapping up unfinished business before lawmakers head out of town for the holidays. The House is also expected to vote this week to impeach Mr. Trump and to approve his renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement, which makes good on one of his campaign promises. The last government shutdown, which lasted 35 days, began last December and was triggered by the president's push for Congress to provide him with $5 billion to fund construction of the border wall. The $1.4 trillion spending measure passed on Tuesday keeps funding for the barrier unchanged at $1.375 billion. Negotiators also agreed to provide $7.6 billion for the 2020 Census, which is $1.4 billion more than Mr. Trump's requested amount. Still, the Hispanic and progressive caucuses of Congress oppose the spending deal. The Hispanic Caucus had pushed for restrictions on how the Department of Homeland Security can transfer funds between agencies for immigration enforcement.\u00a0 \"Without transferability restrictions, this spending bill is effectively a blank check that will allow the Administration to continue redirecting billions from real national security priorities to instead inflict cruelty and militarize our border,\" said the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in a statement. Tucked into the spending package is the permanent repeal of Obama-era taxes that were implemented under the Affordable Care Act, including the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance plans and a tax on medical devices.\u00a0 A provision was also included that would raise the legal age to purchase tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, from 18 to 21.\u00a0 Democrats, who control the House, are cheering several of their priorities in the mammoth legislation, including $25 million for gun violence research \u2014 the first time money has been provided for this kind of research in more than two decades \u2014 and $425 million for election security grants. They also touted a 3.1% pay raise for federal civilian employees and reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which provides financing to foreign companies and governments for the purchase of U.S. products, until the end of 2026. The spending package re-ups the federal flood insurance and terrorism risk insurance programs, and it secures health care and pension benefits for roughly 100,000 retired coal miners \u2014 a provision that was championed by Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia.",

            "article_content": "While the House of Representatives is set to vote on articles of impeachment against President Trump in the coming days, CBS News' campaign reporters say they aren't seeing impeachment come up as a main topic of interest for Democratic voters in early-voting states. \"I've heard a grand total of two questions [about impeachment], and I've probably heard hundreds upon hundreds of questions from voters,\" CBS News' New Hampshire campaign reporter Nicole Sganga said on \"The Takeout\" this week.   Musadiq Bidar and LaCrai Mitchell, who have spent months covering the 2020 Democratic candidates for CBS News in Iowa and South Carolina, respectively, agreed with Sganga.  \"In the past three months, I can think of one town hall where impeachment has come up,\" Mitchell said. The reporters said that based on their conversations with voters across the three states, the biggest issues for voters in the early-voting states are access to healthcare, immigration and criminal justice reform, as well as the opioid epidemic. Mitchell, Sganga, and Badir joined CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" to discuss what they have heard from voters thus far in the Democratic primary process. With the Iowa caucuses less than two months away on February 3, 2020, Bidar said that many Iowans are just now beginning to decide which candidates to support.  \"We are seeing a bit of a change in the top tier of candidates,\" Bidar said. \"Senator Elizabeth Warren was at the top of the polls all summer long. She has seen a bit of a dip [in her polling numbers] and Mayor Pete Buttigieg is starting to take over.\" Bidar added that Iowa is different because rather than casting ballots in a primary, registered voters go to local caucus meetings to discuss their candidates. He said that supporters stand with like-minded supporters and if the candidate is viable and has over 15 percent of the room's support, they can stay with their chosen candidate. But should a candidate not meet the 15-percent threshold, Bidar said, supporters must move to their second, and sometimes third choice. \"What becomes interesting then is all the candidates, all their supporters try to encourage others to come to their corner,\" Bidar said. Sganga said over 40 percent of New Hampshire voters are undeclared and can vote in either the Democrat and Republican primaries next year.  \"This cycle, the bottom line is that voters are still undecided,\" Sganga said. \"Overall, this is a battle of sort of the top four candidates [Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg].\"\u00a0 Sganga said that the addition of businessman Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has opened up the race even further.  In South Carolina, Mitchell said that voters still voice strong support for former Vice President Biden.  \"He's had a commanding double-digit lead in the state since the summer, and what you see is that he has a really strong hold among African-American voters,\" Mitchell said. \"When you talk to his supporters, they may not be as excited about him, but they think that he's the person who can take on President Trump.\" For more of Major's conversation with Sganga, Mitchell and Bidar, download \"The Takeout\" podcast on\u00a0\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0GooglePlay,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher.

            "article_content": "2020 Democratic hopeful Pete Buttigieg on Friday night released the most detailed timeline yet of his work at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, after facing pressure from the public and the media\u00a0to disclose the nature of his work for the company. The South Bend, Indiana, mayor also called on McKinsey to release him from the non-disclosure agreement that he said prevents him from speaking further.\u00a0 The timeline, provided in a statement from the Buttigieg campaign, covers the two-and-a-half years he spent at the company between 2007 and 2010. According to the campaign, Buttigieg worked in Michigan, Toronto, Chicago, Connecticut, California, Washington, Iraq and Afghanistan, serving companies including a health insurance provider, a grocery and retail chain, and a U.S. government department.\u00a0 \"As an associate, I was assigned to months-long stints on 'teams' of typically three or four people working on a study for a client,\" Buttigieg said in the statement. \"The bulk of my work on these teams consisted of doing mathematical analysis, conducting research, and preparing presentations. I never worked on a project inconsistent with my values, and if asked to do so, I would have left the firm rather than participate.\"\u00a0 \"To the best of my recollection, these are all of my client engagements during my time with the firm, but a full release from McKinsey will allow the American public to see the full scope of my work,\" he added. Buttigieg said that his client list is covered under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that bars him from publicly releasing it \u2014 and that despite multiple requests from his campaign, McKinsey has not released him from the agreement.\u00a0 \"I believe transparency is particularly important under the present circumstances in our country, which is one of the reasons why I have released all tax returns from my time in the private sector and since,\" he said. \"I am today reiterating my request that McKinsey release me from this agreement, and I again make clear that I authorize them to release the full list of clients I was assigned to serve.\"\u00a0 Buttigieg also said that he does not plan to break the NDA. \"It's important to me to keep my word and commitments,\" he wrote. \"I know the American people also want a president who they can trust to do the same.\"\u00a0 Buttigieg's work with McKinsey has been in the spotlight this week. He's been asked questions about his time there at several town halls, and The New York Times on Friday published an investigation into his time at McKinsey.\u00a0 Earlier this week, the Times and ProPublica reported\u00a0that starting in 2017, McKinsey helped Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \"accelerate the deportation process.\" The report alleged that McKinsey consultants suggested cuts to spending on food and medical care for migrants, so much so that some ICE agents grew concerned that the cuts would run afoul of migrants' due process rights. \u00a0 Two days after the report, The New York Times Editorial Board slammed Buttigieg for his \"untenable\" silence on the details of his work with the company. The editorial said that the candidate \"owes voters a more complete account of his time at the company,\" and that it's his responsibility to \"find a way to give voters a more complete accounting of his time at the company.\"\u00a0 At a campaign event in Birmingham, Alabama, on Wednesday, Buttigieg called what was reported in the Times \"disgusting,\" but insisted it was \"separate\" from the campaign. \"And as somebody who I left the firm a decade ago, seeing what certain people in that firm have decided to do is extremely frustrating and extremely disappointing,\" Buttigieg said. \"I don't believe that anybody involved in that effort has had anything to do with our campaign.\" On Friday evening, Buttigieg told reporters in Waterloo, Iowa, that he would give \"(McKinsey) a chance to do the right thing\" before he would potentially consider breaking his NDA with the company. Buttigieg also said he will \"check\" to see if he can release the contents of the agreement. When pressed what will happen if the company refuses to waive the NDA, Buttigieg answered, \"Well, then they're putting me in a difficult position because it's important to me to keep my word, and it's also very important to me to offer as much transparency as possible.\" Read the full timeline provided by Buttigieg's campaign below:\u00a0 2007 2008 2008-09 2009 2009-2010 Victoria Albert is a Sr. News Editor at CBS News.

And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.\" However, Mr. Obama also praised Democrats who offer bold ideas, noting that social programs in the United States have started \"modestly\" and then were built upon. \"I want proposals that are bolder with respect to reducing inequality and giving people more opportunity and allowing us to make more investments in our infrastructure and our education systems and others,\" Mr. Obama said. \"Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds. Or the activist wing of our party,\" Mr. Obama said. \"That's not a criticism to the activist wing. Their job is to poke and prod and test and inspire and motivate. But the candidate's job, whoever it ends up being, is to get elected.\" \u00a0 Mr. Obama did not name any candidates in his remarks, which he made in an interview with former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams at an event with Democratic donors in Washington D.C. But he mentioned issues including immigration and health care.\u00a0 His comments came hours after 2020 candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0introduced her plan\u00a0to \"fight to pass legislation that would complete the transition to full Medicare for All\" by her third year in office. Warren's \"Medicare for All\" plan calls for eliminating private insurance and would completely overhaul the health care system. Bernie Sanders has also called for a complete health care overhaul with his \"Medicare for All\" plan, which also would eliminate private insurance and would require raising taxes. Several Democratic candidates, including Mr. Obama's former vice president, Joe Biden, have advocated for building upon the Affordable Care Act \u2013 signed into law by Mr. Obama \u2013 by adding a public option. Mr. Obama said in his interview with Abrams that Democratic donors should not be afraid of \"robust\" primaries. \"For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you that I had a very robust primary,\" Mr. Obama said. \"And I actually think it makes you a better candidate ultimately.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

Pressley's endorsement came after the rest of a grouping of progressive congresswomen colloquially known as \"the Squad\" announced they were supporting Senator Bernie Sanders' bid for the presidency.\u00a0 In a video posted to Twitter on Wednesday, Pressley said she was supporting Warren because the senator is a \"consistent\" advocate for progressive change who \"never loses sight of the people.\"\u00a0 \"You've all heard about the senator's plans, but here's the thing \u2014 the plans are about power. Who has it, who refuses to let it go, and who deserves more of it,\" Pressley said, referring to Warren's various policy proposals, which have become a central plank of her campaign. \"For Elizabeth and for me, power belongs in the hands of the people. That's why she's fighting for fundamental change that restores power to those who've been left behind and centers those who've never had access to it in the first place.\" \"I'm proud to call her my senator, and I can't wait to call her our president,\" Pressley said. Big structural change can\u2019t wait. pic.twitter.com/8Sanof9COD The rest of the Squad \u2014 which is made up of Pressley and congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib \u2014 have endorsed Sanders. Although Pressley has consistently supported left-wing policies like Medicare for All, she has at times broken with other Squad members, such as when she voted for a resolution condemning the anti-Israel \"Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions\" (BDS) movement. Ocasio-Cortez joined Sanders for a rally in Queens, New York, last month that drew 25,000 attendees \u2014 the largest crowd of the Democratic primary campaign so far. Omar and Tlaib have also appeared at Sanders' campaign events. Pressley will appear with Warren at a campaign event at North Carolina State University on Thursday. In a July interview with \"CBS This Morning,\" Pressley said the Squad did not represent a new progressive insurgency overtaking Congress, and noted that she and her colleagues hailed from \"very different districts.\" \"Each of us bring our unique and our authentic voice to this body. We govern in our own way. What we are, are four women who have an alignment of values, shared policy priorities, who have repeatedly happen to land in the same place on the issue of immigration.

Karen Yourish, a New York Times editor who worked on the project, spoke with CBSN about some of the key findings. 5,889 tweets are an attack on a person or thing\u00a0 The president has tweeted more attacks this year than in the previous two years combined, The Times' analysis found. More than half of President Trump's tweets are attacks on either Democrats (2,405 times), investigations such as the special counsel probe (2,065 times), or news organizations (1,308 times). He called the media the \"enemy of the people\" in 36 tweets and attacked immigrants in 570 tweets. But he also takes aim at members of his own administration. \"He rails against his own Federal Reserve and other officials, Jeff Sessions famously, as well as pushing immigration policy and basically threatening at times to tweet out something that he wants his aides to do, if they are refusing to do it,\" Yourish said.\u00a0 4,876 tweets praised a person or thing\u00a0 Interestingly, the person President Trump complimented the most in his tweets is himself (2,026 times). , According to The Times' analysis, he referred himself as everyone's \"favorite president\" on 26 occasions, and bragged about the size of his crowd or applause at events 183 times. He also praised dictators 132 times. 1,710 tweets promoted conspiracy theories During his first week in office, President Trump claimed in a tweet that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election, costing him the popular vote majority \u2014 though there is no such evidence. The Times reports he tweeted about the electoral system being \"rigged\" 40 times. He has also retweeted posts and shared hashtags associated with notorious conspiracy theories. Trump's staff tried to impose a 15-minute delay on his tweets But that didn't work. Yourish said that in the beginning of his administration, White House staff attempted to institute a regular process where communications aide Hope Hicks and others would review each message before he tweeted it out. \"I think that lasted about 72 hours,\" Yourish said, \"and [he] decided that that also wasn't going to work.\" Natacha Larnaud is a social media producer and trending content writer for CBS News.",

Lamberth said in his opinion on Thursday that Joe Arpaio's lawuit against three national media outlets failed to prove malice. The suit claimed that CNN, the Huffington Post and Rolling Stone published inaccurate references to Arpaio's criminal case, in turn hurting his chances at possibly running for the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by the late John McCain. The former Maricopa County sheriff is best known for his tough-on-immigration policies and for being pardoned by President Trump. He was convicted of contempt of court in 2017 after ignoring orders to stop traffic patrols targeting immigrants because they amounted to racial profiling. After losing reelection in 2016, Arpaio is\u00a0running to reclaim his role as sheriff.\u00a0 Arpaio's lawyer, Larry Klayman, told The Arizona Republic he's certain Lamberth will allow the complaint to be amended so the case can move forward to discovery and a jury trial. Arpaio filed a similar lawsuit\u00a0against the New York Times, which has also been dismissed.",

            "article_content": "Orlando, Florida \u2014 An effort by the U.S. Census Bureau to collect state driver's license records as part of President Trump's order to gather citizenship information has been a bust so far. As of Wednesday, the vast majority of state motor vehicle agencies had not agreed to share their records with the bureau, according to an Associated Press survey of the 50 states. The effort over the past couple of months has alarmed civil rights groups, which see it as part of a backdoor move by the Trump administration to reduce the political power of minorities. In August, the bureau began requesting five years' worth of driver's license records, promising the information would be kept confidential. The effort began after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the Trump's administration plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, and the president instead ordered citizenship data compiled through administrative records. At least 13 states have refused to share the driver's license data, 17 are still deciding what to do, and 17 haven't yet received a request, according to the AP survey. Three states didn't respond to multiple AP queries. Republican and Democratic states alike have said no, citing privacy concerns and prohibitions in state law. \"Philosophically, we believe the information in the database doesn't belong to us. It belongs to the people who it pertains to,\" Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said. \"It's not ours to give away.\" Two of the biggest states, California and New York, haven't received requests yet. Three more of the top five most populous states \u2014 Texas, Florida and Pennsylvania \u2014 are deciding how to respond. Census Bureau officials had no immediate comment. The requests started in August and have continued through this month. Many states got calls or emails similar to one from a Census Bureau official asking an Arkansas Driver Services official if she had time to discuss the bureau's \"new and exciting project.\" Scott Hardin, a spokesman for the Arkansas agency, said: \"We are currently working to determine whether the requested information is eligible for release.\" Utah officials turned down the request because state law says personal data can be shared only for public safety reasons, said Marissa Cote, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Safety in the Republican-leaning state. Democratic-leaning Nevada also declined. \"We value our residents' privacy and hesitate to release records in bulk,\" said Kevin Malone, a spokesman for the motor vehicle agency. States that haven't decided how to respond said they were researching the legal and privacy implications. In issuing driver's licenses, most states require documents such as a birth certificate that would reflect citizenship or require that recipients be either citizens or in the U.S. legally. The American Civil Liberties Union has urged states to turn the Census Bureau down. The ACLU and other civil rights groups say the requests are part of an overall strategy by the Trump administration to encourage states to use counts of citizens only, as opposed to total population, when redrawing state and local electoral districts. Such a move could make districts older, whiter and more Republican. \"This endeavor appears to be part of a scheme motivated by an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose to dilute the political power of communities of color,\" said Dale Ho, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project. The Census Bureau said in its requests that the driver's license records would be used, in part, to help build a statistical model for calculating the number of citizens and noncitizens in the U.S. Civil rights groups say driver's license records do a poor job of showing if a person is a citizen. They point to what happened earlier this year when Texas' election chief gave prosecutors a list of 95,000 potential noncitizens on the state's voter rolls. The list was drawn up with the help of motor vehicle records. But it turned out that many of those people had become citizens before casting their ballots. The battle over whether citizen-only counts can be used for congressional reapportionment or redistricting at the state and local levels is being waged in federal courtrooms in Alabama and Maryland. It has been longstanding practice in the U.S. to include immigrants living in the country illegally in census counts, which are also used to allocate billions of dollars in federal spending.",

            "article_content": "Hong Kong \u2014 Thousands of people gathered Saturday for a rally in downtown Hong Kong, belting out songs, speeches and slogans. The rally marked the fifth anniversary of the 2014 protest movement that called for democratic reforms in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. The rally at Tamar Park by the Civil Human Rights Front was approved by police but security was tight, with barriers blocking access to government offices and the Legislative Council building, which was stormed by protesters in July. Demonstrators unfurled a big banner that read \"We are back\" on a footbridge to the government office. A staircase leading to the bridge was turned into a veritable art gallery of protest art, with posters stuck on every available surface of the walkway. One read \"Persevere until final victory.\" Some protesters trampled on pictures of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam that were glued to the floor. At one of the gates to Lam's office, the Chinese word for \"hell\" and an arrow pointing to the building were spray-painted on the sidewalk. \"We think we will lose because their force is so strong,\" said one demonstrator, 22-year-old Sang Chan. \"But if we don't do anything now, we'll have no other chance.\" A 32-year-old protester who would give only his surname, Chau, said they hope to wear down the government. \"It's like a marathon to see who gets tired first,\" he said. Just before the rally started, a small group of black-clad protesters wearing goggles and masks attempted to scale barricades outside the government offices, prompting riot police behind the barriers to fire pepper spray. The protesters retreated but returned, heckling police and thumping metal fencing. Police used pepper spray again, and the scene repeated several times. Some journalists were hit by the spray.\u00a0 Police said in a statement that a large group of protesters blocked the main road nearby, paralyzing traffic and that some damaged property outside the government offices. \"We are back with even stronger determination,\" activist Joshua Wong, who played a key role as a youth leader in the 2014 movement, when protesters occupied key thoroughfares in the same area for 79 days beginning Sept. 28, told thousands at the rally. The 2014 protests ended without winning any government concessions. Earlier Saturday, Wong, 22, announced plans to contest district council elections in November. He said the vote is crucial to send a message to Beijing that the people are more determined than ever to win the battle for more rights. Wong, who has been arrested and jailed repeatedly, said he is aware that he could be disqualified but warned it would just generate more support for the protest movement. Members of the Demosisto party that he co-founded in 2016 have in the past been disqualified from serving and running for office because they advocated self-determination. Wong is out on bail after he was rearrested with several other people last month and charged with organizing an illegal rally. It didn't stop him from going to the U.S., Germany and Taiwan to drum up support for the current protest movement, which started in June over an extradition bill but has since snowballed into an anti-China campaign. The now-shelved bill, which would have sent some criminal suspects for trial in mainland China, is seen as a jarring example of China's intrusion into the city's autonomy. Apart from Saturday's rally in the city center, protesters are also planning global \"anti-totalitarianism\" rallies on Sunday in Hong Kong and over 60 other cities worldwide to denounce what they called \"Chinese tyranny.\" But the biggest worry for the government is on Tuesday. Protesters plan a major march downtown, sparking fears of a bloody showdown that could embarrass China's ruling Communist Party as it marks its 70th year in power with grand festivities in Beijing. Pro-Beijing groups have also vowed to come out. Police have banned the march, but in the past, that has not stopped protesters from showing up anyway. Hong Kong's government has toned down National Day celebrations, canceling an annual firework display and moving a reception indoors. Separately, American academic Dan Garrett, who testified at a U.S. congressional hearing with Wong on September 18, said Saturday that he was denied entry into Hong Kong on Thursday due to \"unspecified immigration reasons.\" He tweeted that it was the first time he was barred after having visited and lived in Hong Kong for two decades. Garrett and other speakers spoke about the weakening of Hong Kong's autonomy as some U.S. congressmen sought to push through a bill to support the democracy movement. The Chinese government accused the U.S. and other foreign powers of fomenting the unrest.",

            "article_content": "With next year's presidential election looming, many Americans say climate change will be a factor in their vote, but it will be more of a factor for Democrats than Republicans. Compared to other issues, Democrats rate the climate change issue more importantly than Republicans do. Seventy-two percent of Democrats call climate change very important \u2014 ranking it just below health care on a list of issues. But just 20% of Republicans say climate change is very important. Instead, they are more likely to describe immigration (62%), the economy (58%), health care (54%) and gun policy (51%) as very important. About 4 in 10 independents say climate change is a very important issue to them personally. For just under a quarter of Americans (22%), a candidate's stance on climate change is a make-or-break matter: They say a candidate must share their own views on the issue in order to earn their vote. For another half of Americans, climate change will be among many factors they consider in a candidate. Another third won't be considering the issue.\u00a0 Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their views on climate change. By contrast, nearly half of Republicans say they won't be considering the issue much. \u00a0 These partisan splits are also related to views on the impact and causes of climate change. Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to think climate change is caused by natural patterns, and just over a third of Republicans consider climate change to be a serious problem or a crisis. Americans who think human activity is causing climate change are more likely to say they'll weigh the issue in their vote. Most who think climate change is a result of natural patterns in the Earth's cycles say they won't be considering climate change much in their vote. Americans overall have relatively more confidence in the Democratic Party than the Republican Party on the issue of the environment. Americans don't give President Trump particularly high marks for handling the environment. Views of how Mr. Trump is handling the environment are related to partisanship. Most Republicans give the president at least a good rating on the environment (though just a third say he is doing an excellent job), while 8 in 10 Democrats say he is doing a poor job. Americans are divided over the Trump administration's response to Hurricane Dorian (50% approve, while 49% disapprove) with a large majority of Democrats disapproving (78%) and a large majority of Republicans approving (86%). Most independents approve of the administration's response. Despite the overall edge the Democratic Party has on handling the environment, one particular plan being advanced by some Democratic leaders \u2014 the \"Green New Deal\" \u2014 is met with skepticism from many Americans. Just 15% of Americans describe the Green New Deal as a good plan that encompasses what's needed to address climate change. Another 26% say it is has both good and bad things in it, but they believe it could start discussions on climate change. Twenty-four percent say it is a bad plan and not what is needed to address climate change, while about a third haven't heard enough about it to form an opinion yet. Even among Democrats, few endorse the plan completely. Just 25% say the Green New Deal is what's needed to address climate change, while 36% think it is a mix of good and bad, even if it could start discussions. Many haven't heard enough about it yet to form an opinion. The plan finds the greatest support from the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party. This CBS News Poll is being released as part of Covering Climate Now, a collaboration of more than 250 news outlets around the world providing in-depth coverage of the climate story. The CBS News survey is conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 2,143 U.S. residents interviewed between September 6 and 10, 2019. This sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the American Community Survey, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, as well as 2016 presidential vote and registration status.

            "article_content": "On the campaign trail, Elizabeth Warren often tells voters, \"Whatever issue brought you here today, I guarantee if there is a decision to be made in Washington, it has been touched by money.\" Warren may feel that the nation's ethics laws needed work long before Donald Trump was elected president, but as far as she's concerned, he's the poster boy for the problem. In a revamped version of her Senate anti-corruption plan published on Medium, Warren called Mr. Trump \"a walking conflict of interest\" and pointed out examples illustrating his and his family's conflicts and offered a corresponding solution to shut them down. Warren wants, for instance, to end the practice of ending misconduct investigations into federal judges who step down. She cited an investigation into whether President Trump's older sister Maryanne Trump Barry had violated judicial conduct rules by taking part in potentially fraudulent tax schemes with her family, which came to an abrupt end this year when she resigned as a Third Circuit Appeals Court judge.\u00a0   The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has seen the value of one of his companies skyrocket since he took a job as one of Mr. Trump's top White House advisers. This strikes Warren as a prime example of why top government officials should be forced to divest from their privately-owned assets that could create conflicts. \"The goal of these measures is straightforward,\" Warren wrote in the post, which outlined nearly 100 ways she wants to take corporate power out of the government. \"To take power away from the wealthy and the well-connected in Washington and put it back where it belongs \u2014 in the hands of the people.\" Warren's Senate office said she plans to reintroduce her 2018 bill, the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, in the coming months with updated provisions similar to those in the plan she released Monday morning. The country's problems with climate change, gun safety, immigration and nearly every issue facing regular people, Warren says, are the result of corporate influence in Washington. She kicked off her campaign last year with a speech in Lawrence, Massachusetts, where the 1912 Bread and Roses immigrant textile workers strike began. Warren plans to discuss the plan Monday at the Washington Square Park speech, which the campaign said is significant because it is near the site of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, where a 1911 fire sparked a labor movement led largely by immigrant women.\u00a0 The event, held in deep-blue Manhattan, is likely to attract a massive audience, estimated to be 8,000 to 10,000, according to a spokesperson for NYC Parks. Warren has already drawn the largest crowd of the Democratic field so far, with 15,000 attending a town hall in Seattle last month, according to the campaign.\u00a0 Last week at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, Warren's crowded buses from throughout the state and from Massachusetts dwarfed the fan clubs of other candidates.\u00a0 This is the fourth plan Warren has released aimed at tackling corruption, and it's the broadest, covering government from the White House to the Supreme Court. Although this proposal offers nearly 100 individual measures to fight corruption, many of them echo points Warren has made on the campaign trail. Warren draws loud applause when she says she wants to \"end lobbying as we know it.\" In this latest plan, she proposes banning lobbying for foreign entities and lobbyists from participating in fundraising events. It would additionally impose a tax on excessive lobbying, force lobbyists to disclose their meetings with officials and expand the definition of lobbyists to include everyone lawmakers. Warren's plan also aims to \"close and padlock the revolving door between government and industry.\" She would go as far as making it illegal for elected officials to become lobbyists at any point in their lives. Warren also proposes holding the Supreme Court to a code of conduct and establishing a new U.S. Office of Public Integrity to strengthen ethics enforcement.\u00a0 She would also clarify the definition of \"in-kind\" campaign contributions to keep candidates from getting assistance from foreign countries or receiving hush money payments. \"I believe that we can root out corruption in Washington,\" Warren wrote. \"I believe we must make big, structural changes that will once again restore our trust in government by showing that it can work for all of us. And when I'm President, that's exactly what I'll do.\" As promised, Warren's anti-corruption plans are more extensive than any other candidate's. But like many of her other plans, they would require not only a Warren victory in the presidential race, but also Democratic control of the House and Senate. House Democrats have passed their own anti-corruption bill, HR 1, in March, but it hasn't reached the Senate floor, and Republicans are unlikely to let it have a vote. Even so, several of the provisions would be likely to face legal challenges. But when Warren talks about changing campaign finance law, it's clear she's ready to go to war. \"Reforming the money game in Washington isn't enough,\" she wrote. \"We also need to comprehensively clean up our campaign finance system. That's why I've also called for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.\" CBS News reporter covering the House.",

            "article_content": "Visiting a black church bombed by the Ku Klux Klan during the civil rights era,\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u00a0framed current racial tensions as part of an enduring struggle that is older than the nation. \"In a centuries long campaign of violence, fear, trauma, brought upon black people in this country, the domestic terrorism of white supremacy has been the antagonist of our highest ideals since before the founding of this country,\" Biden told the 16th Street Baptist Church congregation in downtown Birmingham on Sunday as they commemorated the 56th anniversary of the bombing that killed four black girls in 1963. \"It's in the wake of these before-and-after moments,\" Biden added, \"when the choice between good and evil is starkest.\" Biden's speech to congregants matched much of what Biden stumps on the trail already about how hatred still lurks in this country, and he linked the church bombing to the Charlottesville white supremacist rally in 2017, an event he says inspired him to run for president.\u00a0 Biden's appearance comes at an inflection point for Democrats' 2020 leader in the polls. He is trying to capitalize on his strength among older black voters while navigating criticism from some African American and other nonwhite leaders, particularly younger ones, who take a skeptical view of the 76-year-old white man's willingness and ability to address systemic racism. During his 20 minutes at the pulpit, Biden condemned institutional racism as the direct legacy of slavery and lamented that the nation has \"never lived up to\" the ideals of equality written into its founding documents. But then he added a more personal note \u2014 perhaps the closest he would come to addressing his detractors. \"Those who are white try,\" Biden said, \"but we can never fully understand.\" The former vice president called out the names of the bombing victims \u2014 Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley \u2014 and he drew nods of affirmation as he warned that \"the same poisonous ideology that lit the fuse on 16th Street\" has yielded more recent tragedies, including in 2015 at a , South Carolina, in 2018\u00a0at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh\u00a0and in August\u00a0at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart\u00a0frequented by Latino immigrants. The Birmingham church, Biden said, offers an example to those communities and a nation he said must recommit itself to \"giving hate no safe harbor \u2014 demonizing no one, not the poor, the powerless, the immigrant or the 'other.'\" From his long time in government, first as a senator and then vice president to Barack Obama, the first black president, Biden has deep ties in the black community. Though Biden didn't mention President Donald Trump in his remarks, he has made withering critiques of the\u00a0president's rhetoric and policies on race and immigration\u00a0a central feature of his candidacy. Yet Biden sometimes draws searing appraisals from younger nonwhite activists who point to complexities in his record. That includes his references to working productively alongside segregationist senators in the 1970s to distrust over his lead role in a 1994 crime law that critics frame as partially responsible for mass incarceration, especially black men. The dynamics flared up again Thursday after Biden, during a Democratic debate, offered a sometimes incoherent answer when asked how the nation should confront the legacy of slavery. At one point, Biden suggested nonwhite parents use a play a record player to help their children with verbal and cognitive development. That led to a social media firestorm and commentary that Biden takes a paternalistic view of black and brown America even as he hammers Trump for emboldening more obvious forms of racism. Author Anand Giridharadas called Biden's answer \"appalling \u2014 and disqualifying\" for \"implying that black parents don't know how to raise their own children.\" Biden's audience Sunday seemed more to reflect his relative popularity with black voters. Parishioners wielded their cellphones when he arrived with Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, a white politician beloved in the church for his role as the lead prosecutor who secured convictions decades after the bombing occurred. The congregation gave Biden a standing ovation when he completed his remarks. Alvin Lewis, a 67-year-old usher at 16th Street Baptist, said the welcome doesn't necessarily translate to votes. But as Lewis and other congregants offered their assessment of race relations in the United States under Trump, they tracked almost flawlessly the arguments Biden has used to anchor his campaign. \"Racism has reared its head in a way that's frightening for those of us who lived through it before,\" Lewis said, recalling that he was at home, about \"20 blocks from here\" when the Klan bomb went off at 10:22 a.m. on Sept. 15, 1963. \"No matter what anyone says, what comes out of the president of the United States' mouth means more than anything,\" Lewis added, saying Trump \"has brought out some nastier times in this country's history.\" Antoinette Plump, a 60-year-old who took in the service alongside lifelong member Doris Coke, 92, said racism \"was on the back burner\" until Trump \"brought out all the people who are so angry.\" Coke, who was at the church on that Sunday in 1963, said, \"We've come a long way.\" But she nodded her head as Plump denounced Trump. Nearby sat Fay Gaines, a Birmingham resident who was in elementary school in 1963 \u2014 just a few years younger than the girls who died. Gaines said she's heard and read criticisms about Biden. Asked whether she'd seen his \"record players\" answer in the debate, she laughed and said she did. But he remains on her \"short list\" of preferred candidates. \"I think there may just be a generational divide,\" she said of the reaction. \"People who lived through all these struggles maybe can understand how to deal with the current situation a little better.\" That means, she said, recognizing a politician's core values. \"I trust Joe Biden,\" she said. \"History matters. His history matters.\"",

            "article_content": "The latest CBS Battleground Tracker\u00a0poll tells a story of Elizabeth Warren rising. But not Joe Biden falling. The former vice president now clings to a narrow lead over Warren in our CBS News/YouGov Tracker estimate of convention delegates \u2014 the only count that ultimately matters \u2014 with an estimated 600 delegates of all delegates available through Super Tuesday, to Warren's 545. Warren has gained delegate share as supporters of other, lower-tier candidates have been switching their preferences toward her. Bernie Sanders rounds out the top tier of candidates with 286 delegates in a race that has tightened substantially over the summer. Biden's position is helped by amassing enough delegates from South Carolina and other Southern states, as well as consistently strong showings elsewhere to keep him up in the overall delegate standings \u2014 albeit not by much. State by state in vote preference, New Hampshire now sees Warren just slightly up over Biden and Sanders in first-choice preference there, effectively making the primary there a three-way contest. Biden holds onto a small edge over Sanders in first-choice preference in Iowa to go with that still-sizable advantage in South Carolina. Meanwhile, Sanders has a narrow edge over Biden in Nevada. (Note: Only candidates with more than 2% support are shown in the graphics below.) More broadly, in aggregate vote preference across the early-state contests through Super Tuesday 2020 \u2014 the most important contests up front \u2014 Warren has risen and holds a one-point edge over Biden. These figures capture the impact of campaigns that are focusing on the earliest states, in contrast to other national polls that include states that won't vote until late spring. Biden's support has largely held and even risen in some places like in Iowa, so the movement toward Warren is not attrition from Biden, but of lower-tier candidates losing supporters who have gone to Warren or, in lesser numbers, to Sanders.\u00a0 For instance, Warren has benefited most from former Kamala Harris supporters switching their allegiance. Twenty-nine percent who were backing Harris in July, whom we re-interviewed for this study, have switched to Warren. Biden picked up 15% of former Harris backers. Partly as a result, Harris has fallen behind in the delegate estimate from her position earlier this summer, when she was closer to the upper tier of contenders. Warren is also under consideration by more Democrats (60%) than Biden is (50%) \u2014 suggesting her campaign could have even more room to gain. Biden does better than Warren in being named the first choice among those currently considering him. For Warren, among those voters not currently picking her as their first choice now, almost half (47%) are nonetheless considering her, so she may have potential room to increase her standing if she can convert those voters. And the Democratic field has consolidated a bit, not just on the debate stage, but in the minds of voters. Biden's strong suit continues to be perceived electability. About three in four of those considering Biden think he probably would beat President Trump, similar to last month, but still a higher number for Biden than for the other top three candidates. But Warren has made strong gains on electability. Among those considering supporting her, the percentage who think she would probably beat Mr. Trump has jumped 16 points since June, from 39% then to 55% now. Sanders has also made some gains on electability. More of his potential supporters now think he would probably beat Mr. Trump (58%) than said that in June (51%) or July (50%). Overall, most Democrats in these early states are at least somewhat confident the party will nominate someone who will defeat Mr. Trump, but only about a quarter are very confident. And a third are very or somewhat uneasy. Across the states, descriptions of the candidates are related to vote choice. The candidates are closely grouped by who's seen as most \"easy to relate to,\" with Biden having a slight edge. Biden is described by a plurality as being the most \"presidential\" so far, usually by his current supporters, and most of those who consider him that way are picking him. Warren has a similar edge on being seen as most \"knowledgeable\" on the issues and she wins most of the voters who consider her so. But on the measure of \"inspiring,\" Warren also comes out at the top of the field, though that characteristic isn't as closely associated with vote. Of those who pick her as most inspiring, one in six nonetheless support Biden. The top three leaders would each be the oldest elected president in U.S. history, were they to assume the presidency. Most Democrats say age is not a concern for any of these candidates.\u00a0 But relative to each other, there are some differences. A mere 5% of Democrats say Warren is too old; 37% think Sanders would be too old to serve effectively as president, while 31% say the same of Biden. And the relatively few who do say those candidates are too old aren't voting for them. More Democrats say they would be enthusiastic if Warren became the nominee than say that about either Sanders or Biden.\u00a0 As might be expected, each candidate's backers would be enthusiastic if their own candidate won the nomination. But Democrats whose first choice is not one of the top three contenders are more enthusiastic about Warren as the nominee than they are about Biden or Sanders, helping give Warren that enthusiasm edge. Overall, large majorities of Democrats in early voting states say they would be at least satisfied with any of the top tier candidates as the party's nominee. But Sanders' supporters would be relatively less happy with Biden. If Biden won, half of Sanders supporters say they would be disappointed or angry about that. Sanders supporters would feel OK about Warren as the nominee: eight in 10 of them say they would be enthusiastic or satisfied if she won. And a similar percentage of Warren backers say they would feel that way if Sanders was the nominee. Unlike Sanders supporters, more than half of Warren's supporters say they would be enthusiastic or satisfied if Biden won the nomination. Warren does a little better than Biden and Sanders among those who rank climate change as a \"very important\" issue, as opposed to \"somewhat important.\" Sanders and Warren both do relatively better among those ranking income inequality as very important, compared with those for whom it is somewhat important. While most Democrats are concerned about every issue tested, there are intensity differences within the party on matters like climate change and social justice. The very liberal are more concerned about climate change (91% ranking it very important) than the moderates are (70%). Social justice is very important to 79% of very liberal Democrats, compared to 58% of moderates. Concerns about health care stand out because they unite all Democrats, regardless of ideology: nine in 10 across the ideological spectrum say it is \"very important.\" None of the other issues tested \u2014 including guns, education, abortion and immigration \u2014 match those levels across liberals and moderates. Warren and Sanders do much better among voters who favor a single-payer healthcare system than among those who say it depends on the details, or oppose it. Biden does far better with the latter groups.\u00a0 Overall, policy stances loom as a top reason for those considering Warren, cited by 90% of those doing so. This figure is similar among those considering Sanders. By contrast, those considering Biden cite his time as vice president by a similarly overwhelming amount (87%) and fewer, 59%, cite Biden's policy stances. (Voters in the survey could select more than one reason for backing a candidate.) Democrats split over the party's general message, whether they should advocate a return to how things were before Mr. Trump's presidency or whether to advance an even more progressive agenda than the Democrats had under President Obama.\u00a0 Among those who want a more progressive message, Warren has gained. She had 23% of their votes in June and has 32% now. Sanders has gained a little with these voters, too. We continue to see divisions in the Democratic Party along lines of activism and engagement \u2014 and as is typical, higher engagement comes from more ideological (in the case of Democrats, more liberal) voters. Those posting online about candidates or following them on social media are more for Warren and Sanders. Those who are not doing so are more for Biden, and they're also older. Three in four Democrats are at least somewhat likely to watch the next debate on September 12, including nearly half who say they are very likely to watch it. Most want to hear what the candidates would do as president, rather than how they can beat Mr. Trump or how they differ from their Democratic opponents. Among those who have an opinion, Democrats tend to say the process for selecting candidates for debates has been fair. This is true even of those whose first choice didn't qualify for the third debate. In New Hampshire, 9% of those considering Warren say they've seen her in person, and that's a reason they're considering her. She has been been drawing large crowds, but the fact that only 9% of those considering her have attended one of her events is a reminder that those crowds still constitute a relatively small slice of the population.\u00a0 Among those considering Sanders, 18% say one reason they're considering him is that they've seen him in person. Sanders is also familiar to New Hampshire voters. He hails from the neighboring state and has run in the New Hampshire primary before. Sanders and Warren supporters are more likely than those backing Biden or Harris to say they would definitely donate to their candidate's campaign. They are also more likely to tweet or post about their candidate on social media. Forty-four percent of Sanders backers say they will definitely try to persuade friends or family to vote for him \u2014 the highest of any of the top three candidates. This CBS News survey was conducted by YouGov between August 28 and September 4, 2019. A representative sample of 16,525 registered voters was selected in 18 states expected to hold early primaries and caucuses (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia). This sample includes 7,804 self-identi\ufb01ed Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents. This sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the American Community Survey, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, as well as 2016 presidential vote. The margin of error is +/- 1.8 points. Early states results New Hampshire Iowa Nevada South Carolina",

            "article_content": "Pope Francis on Wednesday said it's an \"honor\" to be criticized by Catholic conservatives in the United States. He made the comments while on a 10-and-a-half hour flight from Rome to Maputo, Mozambique, where he begins a week-long tour of three African nations. It's customary for the pope to come to the back of the plane to greet journalists traveling with him. Roughly 60 journalists are accompanying Francis on the journey and generally each one has a few moments to have an informal conversation with the pope. Usually the conversations are innocuous small talk and don't make headlines. But, on this flight, a French journalist who covers the Vatican, handed Pope Francis a book he'd written titled, \"Comment L'Am\u00e9rique Veut Changer de Pape\" or \"How America Wants to Change the Pope.\" The book includes criticism from conservative American Catholics who dislike Francis for issues ranging from immigration to climate change, and would like to see a new pope elected. Seneze covers the Vatican for the French Catholic newspaper La Croix. The pope acknowledged to the reporter, Nicolas Sen\u00e8ze, that he had read about the book in a Rome newspaper, but that he had not been able to get a copy. Sen\u00e8ze, the author, told CBS News that Pope Francis said to him, \"For me it's an honor they attack me, the Americans.\" He was referring to the critics in the book. The comment made a stir among journalists and a bit later in the flight, the Holy See Press Office clarified that the conversation was in an \"informal context\" and elaborated that the pope feels it is an honor to be criticized by anyone he respects and from a country he respects. Sometimes these informal discussions can be amplified simply because dozens of journalists from around the world are sitting in close proximity on a 10-hour flight and each is looking for a chance to catch a glimpse of an unscripted pope. These papal voyages are closely choreographed and Francis is likely to stay on script. Ahead of the departure, the Vatican underlined that the topics of \"hope\" and \"reconciliation\" will be themes throughout this journey. Those themes are particularly relevant on his first stop, in Mozambique, a country which has been scarred by civil war. Pope Saint John Paul II was the last pontiff to visit Mozambique and the Vatican had been involved in brokering a peace deal which was ultimately shattered by more violence. Now, a new peace deal has been inked and an election will soon be held. Pope Francis is expected to discuss the need for dialogue and the importance of peace. This tour of Africa is Francis' fourth visit to this continent. In addition to Mozambique, the pope will be visiting Madagascar and Mauritius.",

            "article_content": "Joe Walsh, the former congressman who's challenging President Trump in the Republican Party's presidential primary, said in a Monday night CNN interview that he lost his popular radio show and had just received notice before arriving to the studio for the sit-down. Walsh told CNN's John Berman that he expected the move because nearly \"80 to 90%\" of his audience supports the president. \"I am running for president. I oppose this president. Most of my listeners support the president,\" said Walsh. \"It's not an easy thing to do to be in conservative talk radio and oppose this president.\" The conservative had broadcast his show through Salem Radio Network. He also has a podcast connected to \"AM560 The Answer\" in Chicago. Salem told CBS in a statement on Tuesday that affiliates can continue to receive Walsh's program from a different syndicator \"to be selected by Joe Walsh\" after 30 days.\u00a0 \"This announcement does not affect Joe Walsh's local program airing on AM 560 The Answer in Chicago, however Walsh's program will have to be removed as soon as he becomes a viable and legal candidate for President,\" Salem added.\u00a0 While he argued that that the 2020 race isn't about \"the issues,\" Walsh contended that he's running to the right of Mr. Trump and believes in strong immigration policies. Walsh said he does not agree with Mr. Trump's tax cut and would have given a greater tax cut to the middle class. When asked about the lack of policy plans on his campaign website, Walsh focused on the president. \"I'm running against Trump because he's morally unfit. Period. It's about Trump. It's not about the issues. It's about Trump,\" Walsh said. \"But on the issues, I believe in a wall. Trump hasn't built a wall. I believe in border security. Trump has botched the border. The border's a bigger mess now than it was when he got elected.\" Walsh announced his candidacy for president during an\u00a0interview on ABC's \"This Week'\"\u00a0on Sunday. Also in the race against Mr. Trump is Bill Weld, a former Massachusetts governor. Walsh won a House seat from suburban Chicago in the 2010 tea party wave but lost reelection in 2012 and has since hosted his talk show. Walsh attempted to distance himself from past incendiary comments and make the case that he's not Mr. Trump. Walsh instead said some of his past controversial statements were made because he believes in free speech and \"abhors\" political correctness. He admitted to saying racist comments and added: \"I think we're all a little bit racist. We've all said racist things. I bet if you and I went through everybody's Twitter feeds, we're going to find things that are objectionable and offensive.\" Walsh said that with the lack of a radio show, he now intends to campaign \"full time\" against Mr. Trump.

Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from visiting next week, with some criticizing President Trump for\u00a0tweeting\u00a0that the Israeli government \"would show great weakness\" if it allowed the trips.\u00a0 \"They hate Israel & all Jewish people, & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds,\" the president tweeted about the two lawmakers, who he has clashed with before. In Iowa, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg said the ban was a \"bad approach\" for Israel, the U.S. and Palestine, and that America needs \"to get to the point where we can be critical of policies we disagree with and also support the U.S.-Israeli alliance.\" Omar and Tlaib are vocal critics of the U.S.-Israel alliance, and support Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), a movement that looks to sever economic ties between Israel and the rest of the world.\u00a0 Both Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0of California and billionaire\u00a0Tom Steyer\u00a0called the ban an \"affront\" to America, while Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted, \"It is disgusting that a bigot like Trump is attacking [Tlaib] and [Omar] in this way. Opposing [Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu's policies is not 'hating the Jewish people.'\" Some candidates said while they they support the Israel-U.S. alliance and disagree with the two lawmakers' views, Tlaib and Omar still should not have been banned. \"While I strongly disagree with Rep Tlaib and Rep Omar's support of BDS, I strongly agree that vibrant democracies and great leaders must lift up and put the long term strength of the alliance above partisan talking points,\" former Rep.

Cory Booker released a\u00a0plan\u00a0to address and combat hate crimes and white supremacist violence Thursday morning, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Jack Turman.\u00a0 Booker proposes the creation of a White House Office on Hate Crimes and White Supremacist Violence, which calls for federal agencies and community organizations to work together to coordinate the appropriate federal and local response to communities that are impacted.\u00a0 Booker introduced this plan after he addressed Emanuel AME church in South Carolina on hate crimes and white nationalism last week. \"White supremacy has always been a problem in our American story -- if not always at the surface, then lurking not so far beneath it,\" Booker said in his speech.\u00a0 Booker's plan would also create an external advisory group, consisted of community members and groups affected by hate crimes, to advise the White House and other government agencies in their investigations of hate crimes. Booker also indicated he would work with social media companies to curb hate on social media and online platforms through civil rights audits to promote transparency that are \"consistent with the First Amendment.\"\u00a0 The plan also aims to improve the data collection and recording process of hate crimes and mandates the FBI and the Department of Justice to prioritize violent acts \"motivated by white supremacy in the same way that they prioritize international terrorism.\"\u00a0 \"Dr. King once said that 'It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me.' So in my administration, we will use the full force of the presidency to combat hate crimes and root out white supremacist threats wherever they arise,\" Booker said in a statement. JULI\u00c1N CASTRO:\u00a0Former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro on Thursday unveiled his\u00a0\"People's First\" Economic Plan for Working Families, which the campaign says would \"support working families and ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.\" \u00a0 Per\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry, the plan includes the creation of a new inherited wealth tax that would \"replace the estate and gift taxes with a federal tax on inherited incomes of more than $2 million,\" the repeal of the 2017 tax cuts, the expansion of the child tax credit to provide $3,000 per child for every family. It would also implement a $15 minimum wage and guarantee \"at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.\"\u00a0 KAMALA HARRIS:\u00a0California Sen. Kamala Harris on Thursday snagged her tenth Congressional Black Caucus endorsement from Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge. Fudge said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" she believes there's \"no one better to make the case against #45.\" She added, \"African American women are the biggest and best voting bloc in the Democratic party. African Americans people of color are going to determine who our nominee is going to be. We are the base. If we support her and we come out, she will win.\"\u00a0 The Harris campaign tells\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0that the California senator now has more CBC endorsements than any other candidate in the 2020 presidential race. BETO O'ROURKE:\u00a0Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke announced plans to return to the campaign trail today after temporarily suspending his campaign in the wake of the El Paso shootings on August 3rd.\u00a0 In his hometown of El Paso on Thursday, O'Rourke said he would prioritize the communities where Mr. Trump has been \"terrorizing, and terrifying and demeaning our fellow Americans.\"\u00a0 CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry\u00a0says\u00a0O'Rourke also announced plans to visit Mississippi in the wake of the ICE raids that detained 680 people last week. O'Rourke said, \"Anyone that this president puts down, we're going to do our best to lift up.\"\u00a0 O'Rourke also doubled down on his calls for a mandatory buyback of assault-style weapons. He said that he had been late to this position because it was not a \"politically safe\" position to take. BERNIE SANDERS:\u00a0Sanders and singer Cardi B\u00a0sat down at The TEN Nail Bar, a Black women-owned nail salon, in Detroit. Last month, Cardi, 26, reached out to her nearly 50 million Instagram followers asking them for the questions they had for Democratic candidates.\u00a0 She asked Sanders, 77, about criminal justice, immigration, \"Medicare for All,\" free college, wages, and more. A video of the event was posted to Sanders social media accounts, If Cardi publishes the video under her name on the same platforms, it could reach a combined 73,932,550 accounts.\u00a0 That audience is what Sanders has his eyes on. According to the campaign, Cardi's fans represent the kind of voter Sanders appeals to: young, working-class persons of color. They also believe that the rapper speaks to her audience the same way the senator does. Her blunt, plain spoken demeanor, they say, overlaps with Sanders. Time will tell what the partnership will reap for Sanders, but\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Cara Korte\u00a0is told there are intentions for the duo to continue to collaborate in the future. BILL WELD:\u00a0Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who is the only candidate challenging the [resident in the 2020 Republican primary, has spent most of his time campaigning in New Hampshire.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0says he's hoping to make a dent in Trump support in the Granite State. With the President in town Thursday, Weld\u00a0tweeted, \"What does @realDonaldTrump do when 52% of Granite Staters disapprove of the job he's doing? He takes a break from golfing and has a rally. Don't think he understands cameo appearances don't cut it in NH.\" UP NORTH:\u00a0President Trump is in New Hampshire on Thursday for his first 2020 campaign stop in the state. Mr. Trump lost New Hampshire in 2016 by fewer than 3,000 votes, a slim 0.4% margin of votes cast. The GOP hopes they can flip the state next year, and the Republican National Committee has told\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0it has already recruited over 300 volunteers here.\u00a0 But even as popular Republican Gov. Chris Sununu won reelection in last year's midterms, both houses of the state's legislature were taken over by Democrats. Mr. Trump's approval rating is also underwater in the state. According to a University of New Hampshire poll released Tuesday, forty-two percent of New Hampshire residents approve of his performance as president, while 53% disapprove.\u00a0 Despite Mr. Trump's low approval rating in the state, Republicans points to the state's economy as a cause for optimism. New Hampshire is currently home to the nation's fourth lowest rate of unemployment, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.\u00a0 Republicans are focusing on the state as a presidential battleground as well as a senate pick-up opportunity, according to\u00a0CBS News Political Unit AP Eleanor Watson. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen narrowly won her race in 2014, but a 2020 race could look different because she currently has the second highest approval rating of senators up for reelection, according to\u00a0Morning Consult.\u00a0 A potential candidate will be in attendance at the rally in Manchester Thursday night. Corey Lewandowski, who managed Mr. Trump's campaign until he was fired after the Republican primaries,\u00a0has told CBS News\u00a0that he is \"seriously considering\" a run for Senate. Two Republican candidates have already jumped in \u2013 former New Hampshire House Speaker Bill O'Brien and retired Brigadier Gen. Don Bolduc. AND THEN THERE WERE 23:\u00a0In a three minute online video, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper\u00a0announced\u00a0on Thursday that he is ending his 2020 bid for president.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0says he thanked all those who supported and worked on the campaign.\u00a0 \"I've heard from so many Coloradans who want me to run for the United States Senate. They remind me how much is at stake for our country and our state. I intend to give that some serious thought,\" said Hickenlooper. The former Denver mayor failed to have a break-out moment in the race and has been facing mounting pressure to run for U.S. Senate in Colorado against Republican incumbent Cory Gardner. Sources close to the campaign confirm Hickenlooper will spend some time mulling his next move.",

It is great to have you on the show. And most importantly it's great to see you again.\tJUAN CRUZ:Thank you, Michael. Good morning.\tMICHAEL MORELL:I remember having the best mojito of my life (LAUGH) with you in a Bogot\u00e1 restaurant, I don't know, probably six or seven years ago. It was served in a bowl.\tJUAN CRUZ:Yes, I remember.\tMICHAEL MORELL:But I don't think we can talk about the rest of the story. (LAUGH)\tJUAN CRUZ:No, no. Yeah, it's Andres D.C. I remember that place, yeah. A large gourd. It was--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yes. Yes, yes, yes--\tJUAN CRUZ:--a large gourd.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Juan, you've retired from government.\tJUAN CRUZ:Yes, sir.\tMICHAEL MORELL:You spent the last part of your career at the National Security Council -- in the early days of the Trump administration. How did you end up at the NSC?\tJUAN CRUZ:Fortuitously. The front office of the State Department was looking for somebody. As was the White House. The predecessor in the position had departed after a very brief time there, less than a month. And I had been interviewed previously for the job. And General McMaster had heard of me. I thought I was going in for an interview. And instead he pitched me. And I ended up there in less than 30 days.\tMICHAEL MORELL:He's a great guy isn't he?\tJUAN CRUZ:Yeah, I respect him a lot. General McMaster didn't know me from Adam. Gave me a great opportunity. And in his style he recognizes talent, and brings it in, and lets it flourish.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So let's dig into Venezuela which is the issue that I really want to talk to you about. Venezuela was not a high priority for the Obama administration.\tJUAN CRUZ:Yes.\tMICHAEL MORELL:I was there. I know. But it became one for the Trump administration. Why did that happen? How did that happen? How did it go from fairly low priority to high priority?\tJUAN CRUZ:You know, that's an interesting question. I would say that we almost went almost two decades of uneven attention to Venezuela. Even before the Obama administration. But I have no idea why President Trump chose Venezuela as an issue. It's authentic. It comes from him. It was not something that was briefed or coached to him by a member of his foreign policy staff. It's something he believed in. There are some issues like that that he absolutely is tied to and is authentic. Immigration. Drugs. And Venezuela.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Is it the humanitarian piece do you think? I was struck when Syrian President Assad used sarin gas and the president was so taken with the pictures of the dead children. If it was the humanitarian piece in Venezuela. Or if somebody had talked to him about it. It's just interesting to me that it almost came out of nowhere.\tJUAN CRUZ:I don't want to be trite, but he did know Venezuela before through his connections to the Miss Universe pageantry. And Venezuela of course being a producer of Miss Universe's takes pride in the pageantry. And so he had been there before and had a connection through that. Maybe he saw the slow deterioration of the conditions of Venezuela.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Juan, how would you describe U.S. interests in Venezuela? Why should Americans care? Is this just a humanitarian issue or is this a national security issue as well? And I'll tell you, I was at a dinner last night where we were talking about Venezuela. And one of the people there said -- and I disagree with this so I'm interested to know what you're going to say -- that this is not a national security issue. That this is only a humanitarian issue. What's your sense?\tJUAN CRUZ:Well, I'd say there's what I call the trifecta of interest in Venezuela by the U.S. First, it very much is a human rights issue. It goes to the heart of what we believe in. And these issues of human rights violations, or the violation of democracy, is what drives a lot of the U.S. interest. And then finally it is a national security issue. It is a national security issue from the point of view of stability in the region. And inviting those actors from outside of the region who have been involved in issues in Venezuela for a long time-- Russia, China, Iran come to mind. And so it's very much of interest to us. As a student of democracy, I'd point out that when I started in the region in the '80s most of the countries were dictatorships. Mostly right wing dictatorships. Except tellingly Venezuela. Venezuela was a very stable democracy and had dedicated itself for a better part of a decade of two to help other countries reach democracy. So to see Venezuela slip back into a dictatorship is particularly hurtful.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Can you kind of describe the situation inside Venezuela today?\tJUAN CRUZ:Absolutely. It's a failed state. That's the best way to put it. It's a place where nothing functions. And what little functions does so through corruption. It's a place where almost everything you can point to is failing. That means the banking system. Employment. Pollution, if you want to talk about something that most people haven't focused on, but tremendous environmental effects of what's taking place in Venezuela. The shortage of drinking water. Of course energy. Security. Public security. Almost everything you can point to, Venezuela is an example of the collapse of that.\tMICHAEL MORELL:One of the things you hear about is the shortage of medicine and the impact that that has as well. What about refugees? Talk about refugees a little bit.\tJUAN CRUZ:I'm really pained to see the number of Venezuelans that have left over a period of time. Not only the recent migration issue of Venezuelans, but it actually predates that. About four years back. We have a little over four million Venezuelans living outside of Venezuela as a result of that initial movement.\u00a0 And in Colombia in particular we have almost 1.8 million Venezuelans in Colombia. If you want to talk about what kind of stress that places on a neighboring country just think that's about three times the population of Washington, D.C. And that's not to speak of the population of the Venezuelans in Panama, and of course Brazil, and Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina primarily. And those who departed earlier to places like Italy and Spain. Portugal.\tMICHAEL MORELL:It's those refugees in the immediate neighborhood that creates risks to those other countries, right?\tJUAN CRUZ:And a stress on their ability to respond. Imagine if you're Colombia. It's already tough for you to provide education and medical services to your own population just coming out of a 60 year civil war. And then have to extend that even more to an additional 1.8 million people.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Juan, let's keep the discussion going on the current situation. Why do you think Maduro has survived? You know, when you have an economy that's cratered. People fleeing the country by the millions as you noted. And what seems like a vast majority of the country actually despising him. Why has he been able to hang on?\tJUAN CRUZ:I think that's the definition of a dictatorship there. Through an abuse of power and the use of might to stay in power. And of course using the instruments of government to suppress democratic expression. Interestingly enough, Maduro comes to power tapped by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, to replace him. Handpicked successor. Here's an individual who did not have the grassroots support for a position like that. And certainly not within the leadership of Chavismo. So it's a little bit of an aberration. And his inner circle is quite small and tight. And so part of the reason he's remained in power is because others permit him to remain in power. He's got a number of rivals. And there's this very delicate balance that allows an individual like Maduro to stay in there. And let's not forget of course that Maduro has a very close relationship to the Cuban government. That allows him of course an instant area of support and legitimacy that substitutes the lack of support within his own party.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And how much does that Cuban support matter to him? How important is that?\tJUAN CRUZ:I think it's invaluable to him. It's just not giving him advice. He takes advice from the Cubans and a little bit of a security blanket. And of course their critical members of his security team. Bodyguard force and palace security. If it weren't for the Cubans I think Maduro would be further weakened. And it's not just him. It's him and his inner circle have been born of Cuban influence. Maduro studied in Cuba. Ideological studies if you will. And he does have a base of support. Curious because while he is very tight with the Cubans he's not especially close to Raul Castro. I don't think they personally like each other.\tMICHAEL MORELL:But as you know there's a big split in Cuba, right? And he's more aligned with the further hardliners, correct?\tJUAN CRUZ:That's right, old school.\tMICHAEL MORELL:What about the Russians? What role do the Russians play?\tJUAN CRUZ:You know, that's a curious role that the Russians play in Venezuela. There are no historical ties between Venezuela and Russia. This is a relatively recent phenomenon invited through Chavez's desire to have a counter-balance to the U.S. influence. So he invites the Russians. He invites the use and the purchase of Russian military equipment. Communications equipment. Doctrine. Something that is really a foreign import into Venezuela. He does that also as a way to provide some regional balance. And the Russians love it, right? The Russians come in and they get to put their thumb in the eye on the United States. A little bit of a counter-balance to the U.S.'s interest and involvement in issues like the Crimea for example. Or even Syria.\tMICHAEL MORELL:I want to ask you about Juan Guaido, the opposition leader. What can you tell us about him, and his movement, and where that stands today?\tJUAN CRUZ:Juan Guaido is a recent phenomenon in politics in Venezuela. And a welcome one. Here's an individual that's the opposite of a lot of other Venezuelan figures. He's not a tired figure. He represents a youthful outlook. I would say that even socio-economically and culturally he reflects more of the typical Venezuelan. And he's got a great story behind him. So he's selected to be the president of the National Assembly. And he shows up. And all of a sudden he takes all that energy, youth, enthusiasm, and commitment and he turns it into something. And between that and the support of the other opposition parties he's able to really change things around. We were in a low point in trying to encourage the regime to change its ways, its behavior, and to move towards democracy. And he rather quickly moved in there, got the support of the other parties, became a tremendous natural leader, and galvanized the country. And so what we have here is a surprise. I don't think anyone expected this sort of thing. He's come through strong. And he's gotten the support of I guess it's 54 countries now. And that's not an insignificant thing.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Juan, we seem to be stuck at the moment. The kind of picture I have is that both Maduro and Guaido are sort of hanging by their fingernails. How does this standoff end? And what role do you think the U.S. should be playing?\tJUAN CRUZ:Well, there are few options. And even fewer options after the failed let's call it coup attempt of 30 April. I think most everyone was a loser as a result of that event. And now we have these incipient talks promoted by Norway taking place in Barbados. I think that there are only a few ways out. It's got to be either a negotiated way out -- And I don't think conditions are ready for something like that. The regime has become quite good at using talks, and mediation, negotiation, to simply kick the can down the road and perpetuate themselves in power. And in the case of the opposition, quite frankly in these negotiations they've gotten the short end of the stick time and time again. So the regime is pretty practiced at abusing the issue of negotiation. Now thankfully Norwegians have a long experience in this. But I don't think the conditions are there yet. You've got to provide the right confidence-building measures. So that this time the regime really is serious and will abide by negotiations. Things they haven't proven to do in the past. And that the Norwegians can nudge them in the right direction. So one option is negotiations. The second of course is something that is unstated largely. Which is the international community would probably would prefer some sort of coup. Something like the failed 30 April event. Something that allows a faction of the military to, in a bloodless effort, push away the toughest aspects of the regime. And create a transitional government where everyone gets to sit at the table and move the country back into democracy. The problem is that 30 April, the fact that it's a failed event probably makes that less likely. And what makes it more likely is probably a palace coup. The only winners on 30 April are the military. And they're problem now in a position to stage a coup where they could remain in power without inviting important members of the opposition. Or really only the ones that they would like to co-op. And then thirdly, something that's had a lot less talk lately, and is a topic for a lot of division, is a military option. And a military option, whether multinational or largely by the U.S., is a serious matter. I think that most people who react poorly to that probably haven't properly defined what military option is. If you think of military option as a full-scale invasion then I can understand why you would be against it. If you thought a military option could be something other than that -- nuanced options, maybe even non-violent ones, non-kinetic -- then I think that you could probably convince people that some sort of quote, \"military option\" is an option.\tMICHAEL MORELL:It's that latter type that the Trump administration means when it says all options are on the table?\tJUAN CRUZ:I think the president likes to believe that if you're the United States and you have a whole menu of options, why would you voluntarily discard them? So for the president, when he says that all options are on the table, it's not a rhetorical claim. I think that he really believes that these are instruments that could be applied under the right conditions. And I don't think that he'd be in favor of a full-scale invasion. If you know the president he's allergic to military adventurism overseas. But, however, in Venezuela that's not the case. But it's not totally an opposite position, a contrary position. It's actually one that's a little bit modified. Yes, I think it's something that might even be something non-kinetic. But still involving the U.S. military--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Is there a regional military option? A Colombia-Brazil kind of thing? Or not?\tJUAN CRUZ:You know, there are a number of countries now that are stakeholders, right? They have skin in the game. And so for the U.S. to look for an option that excluded allies would be even tougher. And in the past, both the Brazilian and Colombian governments have spoken about possible participation. Long since, however, they've discarded that. Now the question to ask yourself is whether that's a position you hold publicly or a position you continue to hold behind closed doors.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Juan, I know that one of the things that you care deeply about is the day after. The day after Maduro falls and a new transitional government is in place. Why are you so concerned about that? Why are you so focused on that?\tJUAN CRUZ:I'm very optimistic on Venezuela. I would say that right off the bat. And to talk about day-after scenarios really is the talk about more positive things. Regardless of how we reach day after, we are in a day after scenario. So something good happened. And now we're about rebuilding the country. And the challenges are huge. They're enormous. I think a lot more challenging than most people even assume. You have a failed state where most of anything that used to function is broken, outdated, non-functional, and not economically viable. So the opportunities are endless. For example, just to pick something critical to the rebuilding of Venezuela which is its energy and electric infrastructure, to do something like that we could leapfrog into technology that could help Venezuela not restore what it had, but actually create tech that would make it among the most modern in Latin America. But quite honestly I end up gravitating to my strengths, the issue of security. And the security threats of Venezuela are a long list. And would probably get longer on a day after scenario. Because you'd have a dissident military, dissident Chavistas, and others anxious to make any transitional government fail and step in instead of them. And in that list of security matters I think are issues that we could quickly get to and resolve. These include everything from counter-narcotics, FARC dissidents, prison gangs-- known as pranes in the country. Thuggery in the form of motorcycle gangs that have been deputized by the Venezuelan regime to do its dirty work, these so called collectivos. Territorial militias. Colombian guerilla. ELN. (LAUGH) I mean the list is endless. And that's why I think we need to quickly devise a plan and a strategy to address those security threats before they have a chance to neuter any new government or transition government in Venezuela.\tMICHAEL MORELL:What would a plan look like?\tJUAN CRUZ:I think a plan starts with prioritizing the threat. Most of these threats exist today and are ignored by the government. So it's not like all of these threats have to be addressed at the same time. So prioritization of the threat is number one. And I said number two is a good security system. Right now I don't think we can say that about Venezuela. You'd need to train or retrain security services. You'd also have to give them new capabilities. And you would benefit from using lessons learned that we've had in the region from past examples like this. I think that's where you could get a multilateral approach on Venezuela. Several countries could come in with their expertise or best practices. Partner up with Venezuela and counterparts. And accelerate their move into a more modern, responsible, and democratic security service that can address this list of security challenges.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Is Plan Colombia a model?\tJUAN CRUZ:I think vast aspect of Plan Colombia could be a model.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Plan Colombia was? Just for our listeners.\tJUAN CRUZ:Oh, yes. It was a partnership between the United States and Colombia. A partnership of effort, of resources, to address a whole litany of security and other issues that were threatening Colombian security. And help Colombia recover from everything from drug violence and guerillas. And to do so in a methodical, strategy-based fashion. A Plan Colombia in an amended form for Venezuela would be actually a fantastic idea. And if nothing else we do need a strategy.\tMICHAEL MORELL:But it would almost need to be, right, a Plan Colombia on steroids given the significance and the degree of the problems in Venezuela wouldn't it?\tJUAN CRUZ:It would. And the amount of money we're talking about is daunting I think. And it would have to rely on more than the United States. A number of countries to come forward, and participate, and invest in a Plan Colombia. There are a lot of scary numbers out there on how much money would be needed to help Venezuela recover. It's in the billions. Some say $80 billion, $85 billion. I think that number's probably a little low. And I also think that if you look at the numbers on how to rebuild Venezuela's oil industry, which a new Venezuelan government would require to help fund its recovery, then that also tends to be some scary number in the billions. And also a long timeline. Folk who are experts in the oil industry tell me that it could take up to ten years.\tMICHAEL MORELL:My fear is that once Maduro is gone that the international community will say, \"We won, it's time to move on.\" And that there is not a focus on the day after. That's my concern. Do you share that?\tJUAN CRUZ:Michael, you've hit the nail on the head. First, if your measure of success is Maduro's departure, that alone doesn't necessarily mean that there'll be a significant change in the regime. Or even how business is conducted in Venezuela. It might not even mean anything in terms of moving the needle on redemocratization. And quite frankly Maduro, as I said earlier, is not an individual who's particularly a strong leader. Or has a strong following. He simply represents the party. So someone else could step in and be worse than Maduro.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So I know you're not in government anymore. But do you have a sense to what extent there are discussions going on about day after? Not only in our government but between our government and other governments? Is this something that people are actually focused on?\tJUAN CRUZ:I haven't been in government in these discussions recently. But I do know from various forum-- mostly think tanks that have taken this on who have invited foreign governments and members of this administration to sit down and talk about day after scenarios-- I know at that level some discussions have taken place. I'm comforted by the thought of some really serious countries having deep thoughts and conversations on this issue. The Netherlands comes to mind, believe it or not. You have to remember that the Netherlands has territory in the Caribbean just north of Venezuela in the form of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao. So they have some interest. And then of course places out that you wouldn't normally associate with something like this. The Japanese have had very serious considerations. The South Koreans. The Taiwanese. You know, it gives you just a snapshot on some of the countries that you wouldn't immediately think of who have had some deep thought about day after contributions of Venezuela. And given the enormity of the challenge of a recover of Venezuela, we'll need every single country we can count on.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Juan, just a couple more questions on Venezuela. And then I wanna ask a question about Colombia. On Venezuela though, I don't hear senior administration officials, Trump administration officials, talking about Venezuela as much as they used to talk about it. And I'm wondering if it's still a priority it was at the beginning of the administration, or whether it's slipped a bit. Either because there's a lot of other pressing stuff out there, from Iran, to North Korea, to China, et cetera. Or because this is really hard. And making progress on this is really hard. And people have kind of moved on. What's your sense on that?\tJUAN CRUZ:You know, 30 April was significant. A number of top advisors on these issues had their fingers singed on that failure on 30 April. The president was supremely unhappy on the developments that day. I think that he probably put a lot more optimism into the outcome. And so when it didn't happen that way folks had to take a step back. Part of the silence is probably due to regrouping. Taking a quick inventory of where we are and what still can be done. And also it gives everybody a chance to take a deep breath. You'll read in the press that the president is maybe losing interest in Venezuela. I personally don't believe it. I think that much like everyone else he's trying to take an inventory on where we are on this thing. And what our options are moving forward. Maduro's proven a lot more resilient than anybody expected. And I think this is one of those opportunities where the president just wants to make sure the next time he sticks his neck out it's going to have the kind of ending that he would prefer.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Two questions here. What's the best outcome that you think we can hope for in the short to medium term here? And then what's the worst outcome that you fear?\tJUAN CRUZ:The best outcome would be something akin to what 30 April had in mind. The future of Venezuela will be one where everyone will have to be a participant, whether you're a Chavista, or whether you're in the opposition. It's something where we're going to have to forgive some sins. Where there'll be people sitting around the table negotiating who perhaps are not the folk that you would want there. But in the best interest of peace and a resolution of Venezuela, you'll have to permit them to express themselves. And at the end of this there'll be some sort of government that in cooperation, in transition, governs jointly for a period of let's say nine to 12 months. With the objective of moving this into a fair, free, monitorable election where you get an opportunity for democracy to help make choices in Venezuela. That would be, I think, the best case scenario. And worst case scenario is status quo. Because what you have in Venezuela is an economic vortex, right? I don't think anybody sits around the table and believes that things are going to get better in Venezuela. It's not a bet you want to make. And between the sanctions of the international community, and the incompetence of the regime, and poor economic policy-- it's a bad economic system-- I think that pretty soon you'll see a bad situation get even worse. And if for some reason the international community can't coax the regime into doing the right thing I think that what we'll have is the regime just holding on indefinitely. And then unfortunately, Venezuela's a domestic and electoral issue for the U.S. as well. And so as we roll into some pretty critical dates at the beginning of 2020 I think it'll be harder and harder for the administration to do something really seminal in Venezuela. And by the way, conditions will change also with Juan Guaido. He's only president of this national assembly because there's an agreement among the opposition parties to rotate that position. He'll be rotating out of that.\tMICHAEL MORELL:When's that?\tJUAN CRUZ:It'll be in December, January timeframe as well. It coincides with some other timelines.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And do you think there's a risk of a bloodbath in Venezuela? That guns might be turned on the protestors in a significant way? Or do you not worry about that?\tJUAN CRUZ:I do worry about it. I worry about it from the point of view more of a generalized civil unrest. What happens if you don't actually get a coup but you get armed factions within the military? Or the security services turning weapons on each other? Getting some sort of standoff. Or the population gets cut between those who hold the weapons. Just short of the civil war but some sort of civil unrest is a scenario that keeps me awake at night. It's also the case of where if they did turn their weapons on the population, on the average Venezuelan citizen, we have to think of a Rwanda-style catastrophe. And what we and the world community would be prepared to do about it.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So this difference between best outcome-- which is a transitional government that begins to try to solve some of Venezuela's problems, get back to democracy-- and the status quo, do you think that turns on what the international community does? That internally there's nothing to break the log jam? And is going to take something from the outside?\tJUAN CRUZ:I think it would take something from the outside. But it would have to work in conjunction with something happening inside the country. So right now Maduro can stay in power because he's able to pay off a number of factions. Whether these are corrupt members of the military and security services, or of his own civilian government. But if you had a number of factors come into play all at once. For example, gasoline shortages and people demonstrating about that. A return to the serious blackouts in the country. And huge demonstrations. And an inability to pay off, you know, corrupt officials. I think all those factors coming together could be the kinda catalyst that makes for a change inside the country. And allows for international foreign actors to assist them.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Juan, let me just finish up here by asking you about the situation in Colombia. And I'm wondering if you're concerned or not. Seems that the peace plan is beginning to unravel a bit. Cocaine production is on the rise again. Are you concerned about what's going on in Colombia? And is there any link to the situation in Venezuela?\tJUAN CRUZ:Unfortunately, the situation in Colombia's gotten a little messy. And it'll be hard for the government to uphold its commitments for the accords. But it's made worse by the fact that you have just alarming rates of coca production. And of course consequent cocaine production. Something like that makes it harder for the government to respond. Some of these conditions are taking place in areas where the FARC has dominated. Or you have recidivism by members of the FARC. Or you have FARC members who are dissidents and never agreed. Or rather never complied with the agreements. So those kind of conditions make it tougher for President Duque of Colombia to respond to the needs of the country. And then if you superimpose on that, as we discussed earlier, just 1.8 million Venezuelans and the needs of those people, then I think it makes for a pretty hard country to govern and conditions to be met.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Juan, thank you so much for being with us.\tJUAN CRUZ:Thank you, Michael.\t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

Elizabeth Warren\u00a0answered \"yes\" to the same question, and she explained her decision to do so yesterday in Iowa to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster, saying, he \"cozies up to the white supremacists, he calls them 'fine fellows,' he's talked about trying to get brown people and black people out of this country.\" At the National Association of Black Journalists Presidential Forum on Thursday,\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u00a0answered \"I do\" when asked if President Trump is a white supremacist and added, \"at best he's emboldening and empowering people with that ideology.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0told CNN's Jake Tapper \"yes\" when Tapper asked him if Trump was a white supremacist on Sunday. And in a Friday appearance on the network, businessman\u00a0Andrew Yang\u00a0also said Mr. Trump is a white supremacist. \"If someone acts and speaks in a certain way, then you have no choice but to say that's what he is,\" Yang said. Billionaire\u00a0Tom Steyer, the latest candidate to enter the race,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0Thursday that Mr. Trump is a \"racist and a white supremacist.\" On Friday,\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0said that Democrats calling him racist are \"desperate\" and that \"they call anybody a racist when they run out of cards.\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee\u00a0prompted the conversation when he called the president a white nationalist during the second Democratic Debate on July 31. \"We can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House,\" Inslee stated in response to a moderator question about immigration reform. Former Vice President Joe Biden, former\u00a0Rep. John Delaney,\u00a0and\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris\u00a0have all recently accused Trump of enabling white supremacy, but did not go so far as to actually call him one. When asked at the Iowa State Fair on Thursday, Biden said he believes \"everything the president does encourages white supremacists.\" Delaney said on Friday that Trump \"loves the support\" of white supremacist groups and he is \"messaging to them all the time and that's enabling them.\" KAMALA HARRIS:\u00a0Harris hit two local Storm Lake, Iowa businesses on second day of her \"3AM Agenda Bus tour\" through the state, according to\u00a0CBS Campaign Reporter Stephanie Ramirez. The first stop was a Mexican restaurant called La Juanita. Harris knelt down to speak with two Hispanic children and told them one of the reasons she's running for president is because she wants to make sure they are happy, healthy and safe. She also spoke to Iowa voters concerned about farming in the aftermath of Mr. Trump's trade war with China. Harris explained to a supporter that being from California, she understands the agricultural industry. \"We produce almost half the fruits and vegetables for the whole country. I've spent a lot of time with our farmers,\" said Harris. She also faced questions on her Medicare for All plan. A few supporters who greeted her at stops in Sioux City also voiced some confusion over Medicare for All but emphasized the importance of voting for the person they feel can beat Mr. Trump in 2020. PETE BUTTIGIEG:\u00a0Ahead of an Iowa campaign swing, Buttigieg released a health care plan that proposes affordable health care for rural Americans, increasing the number of physicians in rural areas and investing in \"telehealth,\" according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Buttigieg proposes a \"Medicare For All Who Want It\" plan that he says strengthens the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and creates a public option. According to his proposal, the implementation of the plan would create competition between corporate insurers that would lead toward Medicare for All. Buttigieg's plan highlights the importance of improving upon the ACA, first stating the country \"cannot make progress toward universal health care coverage unless we shore up the foundation laid by the ACA.\" The plan also includes bolstering the number of physicians and health providers in rural America by encouraging immigrant doctors to work and practice in rural areas and by expanding funding for programs that \"incentivize medical students and residents to work in rural communities.\" In order to encourage immigrant doctors to work in rural areas, Buttigieg calls for expanding a visa waiver requirement that would allow foreign doctors to work in rural areas instead of returning \"to their home country for two years before re-entering the United States to work.\" \"It is time to break with the politics of the past, meet the urgency of this moment, and usher in a new era for rural America,\" Buttigieg said in a statement. \"We need to lift rural communities up as places of opportunity, both for this generation and future ones. That work begins with securing the health of all rural residents.\" Buttigieg's plan details that many rural patients cannot make health care appointments due to transportation issues and limited specialist care options. To address these issues, the plan proposes expanded access to telehealth by increasing rural broadband internet across the country and doubling funding for the Federal Communication Commission's Rural Health Care Program. UP NORTH:\u00a0Miles away from the Iowa fair,\u00a0New Hampshire campaign staff are busy pitching their presidential pick\u00a0to 2.2% of America's registered voters, all of whom play an outsized role in selecting their party's nominee. Leading the charge is Elizabeth Warren, who has the largest staff in the state. The senator has spent 15 days working the crowds in New Hampshire since announcing her exploratory bid in January. Bernie Sanders, the winner of the 2016 New Hampshire Primary, announced 45 campaign staff in his 2020 reboot last month. The campaign has also accrued the most individual contributions from New Hampshire residents this cycle, in addition to opening six offices and onboarding thousands of volunteers. Despite a late entry, Joe Biden's team of over forty campaign staff began door-knocking last month, following their candidate's sixth day campaigning in state.\u00a0 Also growing \u2013 Pete Buttigieg's operation now boasts 40 paid staffers, and added a data director and four regional organizing directors last week. During the South Bend Mayor's twelve days of New Hampshire retail and town halls, nearly 600 Granite Staters attended multiple candidate events, according to the campaign.\u00a0 AD SPENDING:\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand's presidential campaign has launched a $1 million+ television and broadcast ad campaign in New Hampshire and Iowa. The\u00a030-second ad, entitled \"Imagine,\" will begin airing in the two early states beginning on Saturday, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga. Gillibrand previously launched the first anti-Trump attack ads in the 2020 cycle, called\u00a0\"I Promise\", targeting Obama-Trump voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan last month. \u00a0",

Bernie Sanders blasted President Trump for fostering \"divisiveness\" with his rhetoric, but stressed he does not believe the president wants to see people be killed in mass shootings like the recent ones in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.\u00a0 \"President Trump and nobody else wants to see people mowed down and killed, and I've never said that. He does not want to see that,\" Sanders said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the Vermont independent suggested \u2014 like many Democrats have \u2014 that Mr. Trump's fiery rhetoric emboldens people prone to carrying out violent acts because of racial animus.\u00a0 \"I think he creates a climate where we are seeing a significant increase in hate crimes in this country, hate crimes against Muslims, against Mexicans, against Jews,\" Sanders added. \"He is creating the kind of divisiveness in this nation that is the last thing that we should be doing. So he creates the climate.\" The deadly rampage inside a Walmart in El Paso last Saturday is being treated as an act of domestic terrorism by the Justice Department and a potential hate crime by federal investigators, who are probing a racist, anti-immigrant document purportedly authored by the suspect, a 21-year-old white man. The alleged manifesto decries the growing political power of Texas' large Latino community and denounces progressive positions on immigration.\u00a0 \u00a0 Sanders also urged his fellow lawmakers in Congress to rebuff the nation's powerful gun lobby and pass legislation designed to curb gun violence, which has again drawn national attention. \"The American people want to expand background checks,\" he said Sunday. \"They want to do away with the gun show loophole. They want to do away with the straw man provision. And more and more people agree with something that I have been saying for 30 years, is that assault weapons are weapons of war, they are military style weapons designed to kill people.\" But Sanders again returned to the importance of combating racism and white supremacy, which he said is a pressing issue that should alarm all Americans.\u00a0 \"I want to make sure that we do not see the rise of neo-fascism in this country and that we understand that those white nationalists are in fact, when you get involved in violence, they are terrorists and they should be treated as terrorists,\" he said. \u00a0 \u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "In the wake of the anti-immigrant and anti-Latino massacre in El Paso last week, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, one of seven Democratic senators running for president, vowed to carry out a concerted crackdown on white supremacist groups if elected, saying she would order federal investigators to penetrate racist organizations and thwart potential violent attacks. \u00a0 \"As president I would direct my Department of Justice to investigate white supremacy and other domestic terrorist groups,\" Gillibrand said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"To infiltrate them, to make sure we know if they're planning attacks and to actually combat white supremacy in society because these groups are domestic terrorists.\" The New York Democrat said domestic terrorism should be a federal crime and expressed support for a bill spearheaded by her colleague Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois that would bolster the government's efforts to combat domestic terrorist movements.\u00a0 According to\u00a0court documents\u00a0unsealed Friday, the 21-year-old white man suspected of killing 22 people inside a Walmart in El Paso last Saturday admitted to police that he targeted Mexicans. A manifesto he purportedly authored that federal investigators are scrutinizing denounces the growing Latino community in Texas as an \"invasion.\"\u00a0 Like other high-profile Democrats, Gillibrand   drew a direct link between President Trump's rhetoric on immigration and the apparent motives of the gunman. \"His words have consequences, and the words he has been using have been hateful and divisive and racist and has truly emboldened white supremacy and hate crimes across this country,\" she said Sunday. \u00a0\u00a0 Asked if singling out the president for his rhetoric in the aftermath of two mass shootings might ratchet up tensions in the country, Gillibrand said Mr. Trump is the one making matters worse. \"He is not leading us in the right direction,\" she said. \"He has used words like 'infestation.' He's used words like 'invasion.' That is creating a climate where people are literally today fueled by anger and hate. They are hunting down other people using weapons of war.

            "article_content": "Early primary and caucus voters\u00a0tell\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporters Adam Brewster, Nicole Sganga & LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that Senator Cory Booker and Governor Jay Inslee scored points on the debate stage Wednesday night, while Fmr. Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris held their own under mounting pressure from fellow democratic contenders.\u00a0 And while candidates debated the nuance of healthcare policies on stage, voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina say they're looking for a candidate that can unite the party against President Donald Trump. While all eyes fell on the CNN debate stage this week, state campaigns will shift gears next week, capitalizing on standout performances by engaging voters on the ground via phone banks, canvassing and community organizing. FROM THE CANDIDATES SEN. KAMALA HARRIS:\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris is touting yet more endorsements in Nevada, with\u00a0six more\u00a0out today, says\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin. After notching the support of two state legislators\u00a0earlier this week, Las Vegas City Councilman Brian Knudsen has now also announced his support for the California Democrat. Knudsen\u00a0made history\u00a0last month, sworn in as the city's first openly gay council member.\u00a0 The announcement comes on the heels of Sen. Cory Booker's\u00a0own endorsement news, including the backing of the state's chair for the High School Democrats of America: Katie Lim. Later in the day\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0says Harris made a stop to visit a Detroit security guard. Harris also took questions from the press about Wednesday night's debate. She called the debates a \"frustrating process\u2026There are, I think, better venues where we're able to have a real conversation,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Harris, \"So many of these issues just cannot be captured in 60 seconds, much less 30 or 15.\" \u00a0 Harris was also asked about the attacks on her record as a prosecutor. She defended her work, telling reporters her entire career has been about making sure people are safe. UP NORTH:\u00a0Today, following the second Democratic Debate, New Hampshire endorsements rolled in for 2020 presidential contenders working to capitalize on standout performances. \u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says Senator Kirsten Gillibrand earned key support from two Granite State veterans -- Former Shaheen legal counsel Judy Reardon and Portsmouth Democrats Chair Laurie McCray.\u00a0 Reardon counseled Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in both the governor's office and in the U.S. Senate, serving as a longtime New Hampshire Democratic State Committee member, former New Hampshire House Democratic whip and senior adviser to several New Hampshire presidential campaigns.\u00a0 \"What's been apparent since I first saw Senator Gillibrand on her first New Hampshire trip, is that she has the grit, tenacity, and skills to take on Trump and that she will make an excellent President,\" Reardon said in a statement. \"In all the years I've worked in Democratic primary politics, I've never met a candidate who's more exuberant.\"\u00a0 Senator Cory Booker scored a political endorsement from longtime Concord Mayor Jim Bouley. \"Cory stands out in the field for his executive experience managing his state's largest city, and the results \u2014 a city that's growing for the first time in 60 years \u2014 speak volumes about his success tackling the biggest challenges,\" Bouley said in a statement.\u00a0 Veteran State Representative Jane Beaulieu, Keene City Councilor-at-Large Bettina Chadbourne and Seacoast Democratic activist Chip Moynihan also announced endorsements, backing Senator Kamala Harris following her debate performance Wednesday night. DOWN SOUTH:\u00a0The second round of Democratic presidential debates have wrapped and South Carolina voters say that while there wasn't a clear winner on either night, there were certainly a few candidates who stood out.\u00a0 After the second night of debates,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0asked voters which candidates did best overall. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker were mentioned most.\u00a0 While former HUD secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro was not mentioned as an overall winner, he definitely made a lasting impression with voters. Castro's challenge of former Vice President Biden's immigration stance was deemed as a highlight of the night, and some voters think his performance will serve him well in the coming weeks. \"Secretary Castro helped himself out by repeatedly calling out several candidates\u2014mainly the VP\u2014and comparing and contrasting his plans to theirs, and [showing] his ideas are the best to beat Donald Trump,\" said Tyrus Peoples, a student at Wofford College in Spartanburg.\u00a0 Voters in the Palmetto State also noted that they felt Biden came with \"more fire\" than in the previous debate. In a state where he consistently leads the pack as a frontrunner in the polls, Biden's performance was not considered the best, but South Carolina viewers agreed that he was receiving criticism from multiple directions last night.\u00a0 Bradford Smith, who is also a student at Wofford College and attended the South Carolina Democratic Party's debate watch night this week thought that the second night had a more negative tone. \"[Last night's] debate represented a time of desperation and low jabs from numerous Democratic candidates. At some points he thought it was \"truly an embarrassment.\"\u00a0 \"More time was spent attacking Joe Biden for policies passed under the Obama administration, than actually debating policy issues that impact the American working class,\" Smith said, and he wondered if being a \"winner\" last night would be a good thing in the long-run. If winning has do to with \"attacking opposing candidates within the same party, then multiple candidates such as Cory Booker, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, and Bill de Blasio would take the crown.\"\u00a0 But for \"real and genuine answers about policy issues,\" Smith thinks \"perhaps Andrew Yang would be the 'winner' of [last night's] debate.\" \u00a0 IN OTHER NEWS OUTSIDE THE OVAL:\u00a0One name that came up frequently during Wednesday night's debate is former President Barack Obama. So what does he think about how it went? A source familiar with his thinking wouldn't tell\u00a0CBS News Political Correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0whether the former president watched Tuesday and Wednesday's debates, but said he continues to keep tabs on the campaign.\u00a0 Obama has no plans to weigh in on the race this year, said the person, who was granted anonymity to speak frankly on a politically sensitive subject. \"His legacy is going to be fine that there's a staying power to it and the things under attack are high water marks for the country,\" the person said. \u00a0 The former president believes it's appropriate to review and debate his legacy, but believes it should be \"fact-based,\" especially in regards to his deportation policy. \"The debate over immigration doesn't always seem to be rooted in reality,\" the person said. \u00a0 During the eight years of the Obama administration, the Homeland Security Department prioritized deporting criminals and people who had recently illegally crossed the border. The Trump administration has targeted family units and in several cases, deported people who have lived in the country for several years.\u00a0 \"It is perilous to the party to attack one of the most popular figures among voters in the country,\" the Obama associate added. \"This primary has got to be about making the strongest possible case against Donald Trump and not be a circular firing squad. It could ultimately backfire on candidates who choose to engage in this rhetoric.\" Obama has no plans to campaign for anyone this year.\u00a0\u00a0 RULES, RULES, RULES:\u00a0The Republican Nation Committee has held two informational briefings for its members on the new fundraising platform called WinRed. The briefings took place in Charlotte, North Carolina at the RNC's annual three-day summer meeting.\u00a0 The briefings were closed to the press, but two members who attended told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ellee Watson\u00a0that state parties are excited for the support they're getting, even though it comes with a slight learning curve. An RNC official said 51 out of the 56 states and territories are already using the platform.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Texas Rep. Will Hurd, the sole black Republican lawmaker in the House and one of the few elected officials in the party to openly criticize President Trump, announced on Thursday he will not seek reelection next year, becoming the sixth GOP member to seek retirement in the last two weeks.   Hurd made the announcement in a statement and on Twitter, where he said he will continue to \"pursue opportunities outside the halls of Congress to solve problems at the nexus between technology and national security.\" He also tweeted that he's \"taken a conservative message to places that don't often hear it. I'm going to [stay] involved in politics to help make sure the Republican Party looks like America.\" Hurd, a former CIA officer, has represented his sprawling border district in south Texas since he toppled a Democratic incumbent in 2014. He has been reelected twice by razor thin margins in 2016 and 2018, when he bested Iraq war veteran Gina Ortiz Jones by fewer than 1,000 votes and became one of the few Republicans in districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016 to survive the Democratic wave during the 2018 midterms.\u00a0 The Texas Republican has often isolated himself from the president and criticized some of his immigration proposals, including the construction of a wall along the entire U.S.-border. He has also supported legislation to place young undocumented immigrants, dubbed DREAMers, on a pathway to U.S. citizenship.\u00a0 His decision on Thursday is likely to disappoint Republicans and invigorate Democrats, who, along with playing defense to protect their majority in the House during the November 2020 elections, are also targeting swing districts, especially those with large Latino communities like Hurd's. Nearly 65% of eligible voters in Texas' 23rd Congressional District are Latino.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has eyed Hurd's Texas district as one of the most vulnerable in 2020 and Ortiz Jones has already filed for a rematch.\u00a0 In the second quarter, Hurd raised about $200,000 more than Ortiz Jones and had close to $713,000 cash on hand.\u00a0 Democrats are looking to capitalize on Hurd's announcement and prove that Texas will be a big battleground for 2020.\u00a0 \"Texas Democrats are rising up everywhere, clearly Will Hurd knew his time was up. As we have said before, we wouldn't be surprised if there were more retirements,\" said Texas Democratic Party Director Manny Garcia.\u00a0 Hurd's announcement follows Rep. Mike Conaway, another Republican congressman from Texas who announced his retirement yesterday. There have been six Republican members in the past two weeks that have said they would not seek reelection in 2020.\u00a0 Texas Republican Party Chairman James Dickey told CBS News on Wednesday that early retirement announcements do make it easier to find competitive candidates. Dickey said the party appreciated Hurd's service and for \"frequently going against the grain for what he believed was right for his constituents.\"\u00a0 \"We wish him well and hope that he will stay involved as we fight to defend Texas' 23rd Congressional District!\" Dickey said in a statement.\u00a0 The DCCC had six Texas districts on their 2020 target list, the most of any state.\u00a0 \"Hurd has been a lockstep supporter of the worst of Washington Republicans' policies and he sealed his fate when he pledged to vote for Donald Trump in 2020. Democrats will win this seat and if Will Hurd doesn't believe he can keep his job in a changing Texas, his colleagues must be having second thoughts too,\" said DCCC spokesperson Avery Jaffe in a statement.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Detroit \u2014 One name invoked frequently during\u00a0Wednesday night's debate was that of former President Barack Obama, who has no plans to participate in the Democratic presidential campaign this year but is keeping tabs on the contest. A source familiar with his thinking wouldn't say whether the former president watched Tuesday and Wednesday's debates, but said Obama believes \"his legacy is going to be fine, that there's a staying power to it and the things under attack by this president are high water marks for the country.\" The person familiar with the former president's thinking was granted anonymity to speak frankly about the politically sensitive subject. Obama remains extremely popular among Democrats, most of whom remember his presidency very fondly. In a CBS News poll in May, 58% of Democrats nationwide rated his tenure as \"excellent,\" with another 33% saying it was \"good.\" Just 9% rated his time in office as \"fair\" or \"poor.\" The former president believes it's appropriate to review and debate his legacy, but believes it should be \"fact-based,\" especially in regards to his deportation policy, the person said. \"The debate over immigration doesn't always seem to be rooted in reality,\" the person said. During the eight years of the Obama administration, the Department of Homeland Security prioritized deporting criminals and people who had recently illegally crossed the border. The Trump administration has targeted family units and in several cases, deported people who have lived in the country for several years.\u00a0 \"It is perilous to the party to attack one of the most popular figures among voters in the country,\" the Obama associate added. \"This primary has got to be about making the strongest possible case against Donald Trump and not be a circular firing squad. It could ultimately backfire on candidates who choose to engage in this rhetoric.\" During Wednesday's debate, former Vice President Joe Biden frequently invoked his partnership with Obama, but repeatedly demurred when pressed by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and others on whether he'd ever raised concerns about the administration's deportation policy.\u00a0 Biden's refusal to engage on the subject earned a powerful rebuke from Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who told Biden, \"You can't have it both ways. You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not.\" Campaigning Thursday in Detroit, Biden echoed the former president's concerns \u2014 although there was no sign of coordination between the two. \"I was surprised about how much incoming there was about Barack,\" Biden told reporters outside a Detroit hot dog restaurant where he met with the city's mayor and other local leaders. Rebecca Kaplan and Stephanie Ramirez contributed to this report. Ed O'Keefe is a senior White House and political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "In a hot, crowded rustic venue that typically hosts wedding receptions, about 300 people fanned themselves with paper plates attached to tongue depressors as they waited to hear South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg speak on a sweltering Saturday evening in Shenandoah, Iowa. \"Suffer the children unto me\" quoted Buttigieg, referencing scripture as he talked about his position on immigration. \"If The Word that says you will know me by my works also says we ought to heal the sick, you don't have to be on board with cutting health care funding to vulnerable Americans,\" he added. Buttigieg, an outspoken Episcopalian, often references his faith when explaining what informs some of his political beliefs. And in Iowa, a state where 77% of people practice some form of Christianity according to Pew, there's a desire among religious Democrats to hear candidates speak about their faith and how it informs their values.\u00a0 \"Let's remind everybody that God doesn't belong to a political party,\" Buttigieg told the crowd in Shenandoah. The line received a loud round of applause as he added that he wants to represent people \"of any religion and no religion\" equally.\u00a0 For some caucus goers, Buttigieg's message struck a chord. \"I think that people that are religious it's very important to them and they want to know that the candidate that they're selecting may share some of their values,\" said Jan Norris of Red Oak. \"I resent the fact that the Republicans try to own Christianity because they're not acting like Jesus at all.\" \"I like that he talks about faith because as a Catholic I think there's this image that you have to be a Republican or all Catholics are Republican,\" said Jake Johnson, a student at Central College. \"I've just seen too many people under a sort of spell that says if you're motivated by faith that means you're conservative,\" Buttigieg told reporters in Iowa earlier this month. \"Electing a president who has been characterized by every personal trait that scripture councils against, I think it has a lot of people of faith wondering whether there isn't a different home that they can find politically.\" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker also invokes scripture on the stump. He often closes his appearances with a quote from Genesis 37:19. \"Behold, here cometh the dreamer,\" Booker said during an event in Sioux City in April. He challenged the crowd to \"avoid the quicksand of division\" and take \"the high road of faith and love and decency and grace.\" Booker has said he starts his days with prayer and told the crowd he prayed that morning that God \"allows me the privilege of leading this nation.\" He later went on to say, \"I would rather hang out with a nice atheist than a mean Christian any day of the week.\" \"My foundation in my life is my faith,\" Booker said during a live podcast taping in Iowa in June, although he added that he sometimes feels a little bit uncomfortable speaking about the topic. \"I'm one of these people that says before you tell me about your religion, first show me how you treat other people.\" Buttigieg and Booker are not alone in acknowledging their faith on the campaign trail. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was a Sunday School teacher and still sometimes references Biblical passages. Former Vice President Joe Biden and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney are known to be devout Catholics. Marianne Williamson has made spirituality a core theme of her presidential campaign. State Auditor Rob Sand, who speaks very openly about his faith, says some religious Iowa Democrats have felt left behind and want to hear more politicians talk about it. He said people \"get emotional\" when he talks about his faith because it has felt \"one dimensional\" for so many years. \"I feel like I was hungry to hear it my whole life. I wanted to hear from people about what their faith meant to them,\" Sand said. \"For all the people out there that have been wanting to hear it all of their adult life, they're going to be grateful.\" Sand was the only Democrat to flip a statewide seat in Iowa in 2018, winning in a year where Republicans retained control of the governor's office. Sand said that being willing to speak about his faith played a role in his victory. \u00a0 \"There are people that I'm able to reach by talking about my faith in a way that I wouldn't be able to reach them just by talking about issues,\" Sand said. \"Occasionally someone will say, 'look, we should just leave all that stuff out altogether.' The problem with that is it means that Democrats are disempowered from talking about something that means a great deal to a lot of people.\" Sophie Mathonnet-VanderWell, a mainline Protestant pastor in the rural community of Pella, says Democrats in her church would welcome a candidate who speaks more openly about faith.\u00a0 \"My sense is that the Democratic Party has not always been incredibly open to faith kinds of things, and has somewhat sidelined people of faith generally,\" said Mathonnet-VanderWell, who is a registered Democrat. \"We need to think about or talk about the issues we care about and talk about them in terms of faith.\"\u00a0 Speaking about your faith comes with some risks, Sand says, because \"there are people who get turned off by it.\" He says it's about striking a balance between being true to yourself and acknowledging there are some differences with people listening to your message. \"I try to acknowledge that people of any faith or no faith at all are welcome to live here and to lead here,\" Sand said. \"It's not about needing to have people who are of the Christian faith in positions of elected office. It's about me, personally, not being willing to sit out a conversation.\" Matt Russell, the executive director of Iowa Interfaith Power and Light, a bipartisan group that advocates for faith-based solutions to climate change, says there has been a \"positive response\" to Democratic candidates who are talking about values \"in relationship to faith.\" But Russell warns that it can backfire if it comes across as inauthentic. \"It can't be a gotcha campaign strategy,\" Russell says. \"If a candidate starts speaking in ways...that makes it sound like they're really profoundly a person of faith and then they don't really have a narrative of that, or a history of that, Iowans are going to see right through it. So you can't fake it.\" Sand says he believes there is probably a net benefit for candidates who speak about their faith in Iowa. He said Iowans have a \"quieter faith\" than people in other parts of the country but thinks there's an opening for Democrats to talk about religion.\u00a0 \"I think there is a bigger opportunity right now than maybe I have ever seen in my life for people who happen to be Democrats to talk about their faith and have it resonate,\" Sand said. \"I think there are I think there are a lot of Christians out there who have been steady Republicans who see the actions there now, and who know that they don't fit in their faith. And at the same time, they also don't know if they are welcome in the other big party.\" Linda Bernard from Jefferson, South Dakota said after an event in Sioux City last week that she worries about Democrats going too far left and forgetting about religious voters. She fears it means Democrats could lose in November 2020.\u00a0 \"There's a very large religious middle in this country,\" Bernard said. \"We need to address what they're talking about and get off the fringes.\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Standing side by side, the four Democratic congresswomen of color who were targeted in a racist tirade by President Trump that elicited widespread condemnation mounted a vigorous defense of their progressive agendas and tried to downplay the commander-in-chief's controversial comments, which they said were just the latest episode of a pattern of bigoted and divisive rhetoric. In a news conference at the Capitol on Monday afternoon, Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts said the president's remarks were part of an effort to pit Americans against each other.\u00a0 \"He would love nothing more than to divide our country based on race, religion, gender, orientation or immigration status, because this is the only way he knows he can prevent the solidarity of us working together,\" Omar said.\u00a0 Omar noted that Mr. Trump has made divisive, sexist and racist statements both as president and during his campaign. She said it was \"complete hypocrisy\" for the president to say critics of his policies should leave the country. \"When people say, 'If you say a negative thing about the policies in this country, you hate this country,' to me it sort of speaks to the hypocrisy,\" Omar said. \"When this president ran and until today, he talked about everything that was wrong in this country and how he was going to make it great. And so for him to condemn us and to say we are un-American for wanting to work hard to make this country be the country we all deserve to live in, it's complete hypocrisy.\" Her colleague Pressley struck a similar tone, saying that the group of four lawmakers represents hundreds of thousands of constituents, as well as marginalized Americans across the country.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"Despite [the president's] attempts to marginalize us and to silence us, please know that we are more than four people. We ran on a mandate to advocate for and represent those ignored, left out and left behind. Our squad is big,\" Pressley said, referring to the moniker some use to describe the four lawmakers.\u00a0 To reassure children of color who could feel demonized by the president's remarks, Ocasio-Cortez, the daughter of Puerto Rican parents, recounted a childhood memory when father took her to the reflecting pool near the Lincoln Memorial, pointed towards the other National Mall monuments and told her the country belonged to everyone \u2014 including her. \"No matter what the president says, this country belongs to you,\" she said, referring to children in the U.S. Although he did not name them, Mr. Trump on Sunday morning posted\u00a0a series of tweets\u00a0deriding \"'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen,\" alluding to Omar, Pressley, Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib.\u00a0 \"So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.\"\u00a0 \"These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!\" the president added.\u00a0 During an event at the South Lawn on Monday, the president doubled down on his statements, saying the progressive foursome \"hate our country.\" The comments drew swift and scathing condemnation on Sunday from Democrats in Congress and those hoping to challenge Mr. Trump in the general presidential election next year. Like others in her party who accused the president of stoking racial animus, Pelosi called the remarks \"xenophobic.\"\u00a0 The speaker announced on Monday that Democratic lawmakers in the House will be introducing a resolution to condemn the president's racist attack. She urged her Republican colleagues to support it.\u00a0 Some also pointed to the factual inaccuracies in Mr. Trump's comments. He claimed that the four Democratic congresswomen \"originally came\" from foreign countries but only Omar was born outside the U.S. Pressley, an African American, was born in Ohio. Ocasio-Cortez, of Puerto Rican heritage, was born in New York. Tlaib, the daughter of Palestinian immigrants, was born in Detroit.\u00a0 Omar, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in Somalia, a country she and her family fled from because of a civil war and ethnic strife. They stayed in a refugee camp in Kenya before settling in the U.S. when she was 10 years old, and she became a citizen at 17. Although some Republicans refused to address the comments or demurred when asked about them, several GOP lawmakers publicly denounced Mr. Trump's comments on Monday. Most, however, stopped short of calling them racist and made sure to note that they believe Omar, Pressley, Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib are far-left Democrats who hold fringe views.\u00a0 \"I disagree strongly with many of the views and comments of some of the far-left members of the House Democratic Caucus \u2013 especially when it comes to their views on socialism, their anti-Semitic rhetoric, and their negative comments about law enforcement,\" Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said in a statement. \"But the President's tweet that some Members of Congress should go back to the 'places from which they came' was way over the line, and he should take that down.\"\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, that aired Sunday, July 14, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with Mark Morgan. He is the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP, which enforces immigration law and patrols the U.S. border. Good morning to you, commissioner.\u00a0 ACTING CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION COMMISSIONER MARK MORGAN: Good morning. Thanks for having me.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand you're at CBP. You were previously at ICE. The president has said those who will be arrested today will either be put in prison or sent back. What can you tell us about how many people will be rounded up and where they'll go? MORGAN: So, the- the- the numbers are really going to be left up to ICE and so I really want to try to stay away from the operational details specifically and focus on the numbers or cities or where they're going to be going out. But again, I think what we need to do- part of this- this narrative is, we need to be intellectually honest when we're going forward with this, is that the individuals that ICE goes after and they do this every single day are not individuals that are here undocumented. They're individuals that are here illegally. And in this case, their part has always been, and it will be, to go after those that are criminal aliens meaning those people that are here illegally and have- and have committed additional crimes against American citizens. But also, part of that priority is to also go after and- and apply consequences and enforce the rule of law to those individuals who had due process and received a final order of removal from a judge, and they still remain here illegally. To- to maintain integrity in the system, we have to apply cuts- consequences to everyone. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, can you say though whether there will be family separations? If someone is arrested, their children come home either they're U.S. born, or they're just coming home to find a parent who is now in detention, what happens? Can you avoid that situation?\u00a0 MORGAN: So of- of course, the- the design is not about family separation. That's not the intent. Never has been and never will be. The intent is to enforce-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you avoid it? MORGAN:\u00a0 --the rule of law. There- there are challenges. Absolutely. But I can tell you the men and women of ICE they- they are, too, American heroes. They- they're mothers, they are fathers, brothers, and sisters. They're going to apply this with- with humanity and compassion. There's a whole host of scenarios that could go. I'll give you an example. For one, if they run across a mother who came here illegally, had due process, had a order removal, but she's currently in her third trimester of pregnancy, of- of course they're not going to apprehend that individual. They're going to give her a- a paper, a notice to appear and- and come back later when it's appropriate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Where will these people go? Because as we've been talking about and in the facilities you run, there's this crisis of overcrowding. Is ICE putting these people in centers that are already overcrowded as well? MORGAN: No. So- and- and I'm glad you asked that question, because there's a lot of confusion with respect to the holding facilities that Customs and Border Protection hold that are meant just kind of like a police station. They're not meant to be, nor they were ever designed to be, long term holding facilities. ICE, the facilities that they have are. And so families, for example, will go to family residential centers that are specifically designed to house families on a longer term basis. And it's a very different environment than what you'll see from a CBP Border Patrol holding facility. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Obama deported about 3 million people. President Bush, about 2 million. President Trump's far below that. But there is this question of why these arrests are happening now at a time when you have been talking about overcrowding, at a time when you're in the middle of a re-election campaign. It seems to be, to many critics, politically motivated. MORGAN: So I can't take- speak to you from- from a political side. I can speak to you from a law enforcement side. And I can tell you, Margaret, one of the largest incentives, pull factors, for these people is you grab a kid, that is your passport into the country. And once you get in the country, you're allowed to stay. If we don't apply interior enforcement action, consequences, those- to those that have received due process-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but why-- MORGAN: --they've received an idle order-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --did the president announce it? This is a law enforcement action he announced. MORGAN: You- You'll have to ask the president on that. But alls I can tell you is, I support this one hundred percent. This is a- an essential consequence that we need to apply to help take that element away, that pull factor, so they'll stop making the dangerous trek and risking their lives. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president, this morning, put out a series of tweets that I want to read to you, or part of. He suggested that foreign born female members of Congress need to quote, \"go back,\" to quote, \"the places from which they came.\" Who is the president talking about and how is this helpful if you're trying to get Democrats in Congress to work with you? MORGAN: Again, you're gonna have to ask the president what he means by those specific tweets.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't know who he's talking about? MORGAN: I- I- I think that you need to talk to the president about his specific tweets. What- what I- what I will tell you is that we absolutely have a crisis on the border one hundred percent. And Congress I- I can tell you unequivocally, Congress has failed to do what they need to do to adjust this crisis. We've been pleading with them our- for a long time and we've been on the Hill asking for a long time you fix the floor settlement agreement, you fix the TVPRA catch and release and 85 percent of this crisis ends the next day. That's what we need Congress to do on a bipartisan effort. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why I asked you if it was helpful or not to make comments like that. Let me ask you about what's happening in some of the facilities that you oversee. Today the president also tweeted there have been great reviews of children's detention centers. We know the vice president went down and toured multiple facilities, one of them being a children's center. The House Oversight Committee this week released a report saying there are at least still 30 children separated from their parents for more than a year who haven't been reunited with them and have not been released to somebody else to take care of them. So do you understand why facts like that make it hard for anyone in Congress, Democrats say, to trust the administration with holding children in detention or potentially for longer periods of time as some are proposing? MORGAN: So what- what I would say is facts matter all the way around. Neither does the rhetoric that's out there that's absolutely false. That- that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is a House Oversight report. MORGAN: Again, you said facts are important and I'm saying I agree. Facts are important. Just- just-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You agree that that is a fact? This 30- the 30 children who continue to be separated. MORGAN: Yes, we- we've been-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. MORGAN: --talking about that for a long time and again they're- they're- making progress to reunite those families that happened a long time ago. But again what- what we're talking about now- let's talk about facts and the facts are that- that we've been asking Congress for a very long time for the supplemental, for example, right? Because we've agreed that children should not be in facilities that Border Patrol have. They're holding facilities. They were never designed for kids. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the four and a half billion that was just approved. MORGAN: Yes- yes ma'am. And so- so the four and a half billion we've been asking- three and a half billion of that went to HHS. I- I'm not in that department but yet I'm asking for the supplemental to- to get HHS the funding they need, so the children, for example, could get out of the Border Patrol holding facilities where they don't belong. We were- we were asking that for months. And Congress sat on their hands-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MORGAN: --and didn't provide that funding. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that funding you do have now. The vice president said-- MORGAN: And it's working. MARGARET BRENNAN: --on this-- MORGAN: And it's working. MARGARET BRENNAN: --on this program two weeks ago that some of these- some of these conditions are unacceptable. We have video of the tour that he went on as well where he saw where men are being held, different facility than where the children are. And I want to read from the pool report written by Washington Post Josh Dawsey. Said, \"the cages were so crowded it would have been impossible for all of the men to lie in the concrete. There were three hundred and eighty four single men in the portal, no mats or pillows, some sleeping on concrete. When they saw the press arrive, the men began shouting and wanted to tell us they'd been in there 40 days or longer. They were hungry and wanted to brush their teeth. It was sweltering hot. Agents were wearing face masks.\" Are these acceptable conditions? MORGAN: So, first of all, the- the way to describe those conditions, I would not describe them as- as they were described. But- but even- even so-- MARGARET BRENNAN: This was the video. MORGAN: No. You- you're-- MARGARET BRENNAN: This was the video and this is a reporter's eyewitness account. MORGAN: Right. So I- I would not consider that sweltering hot. I was there alongside the vice president when I was there. But make no mistake, was it overcrowded? Absolutely. But Margaret, we've been saying that for a very long time that these conditions are overcrowded. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you agree it's unacceptable? MORGAN: Oh, absolutely it's unacceptable. And- and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So what are you doing to change those conditions now? MORGAN: So-- MARGARET BRENNAN: As you said that funding has been approved. MORGAN: Okay, but- but this is very important though is this could have been prevented in- in a couple of ways. Had Congress given the funding earlier than- than when we ask it would have helped alleviate some of the overcrowding. MARGARET BRENNAN: But now-- MORGAN: The other thing right now is we're con- continuing to ask Congress. We need legislative fix. We need Congress to act right now. Senator Lindsey Graham has a bill that he's trying to push forward right now that would absolutely overnight help eliminate that- what you saw when we went down there with the vice president.

            "article_content": "A California appeals court on Wednesday upheld a freeze on Pentagon money to build a border wall with Mexico, casting doubt on President Trump's ability to make good on a signature campaign promise before the 2020 election. A divided three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco agreed with a lower court ruling that prevented the government from tapping Defense Department counterdrug money to build high-priority sections of wall in Arizona and New Mexico.  The decision is a setback for Mr. Trump's ambitious plans. He ended a 35-day government shutdown in February after Congress gave him far less than he wanted. He then declared a national emergency that the White House said would free billions of dollars from the Pentagon.  The case may still be considered, but the administration cannot build during the legal challenge.  A freeze imposed by U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. of Oakland in May prevented work on two Pentagon-funded wall contracts - one spanning 46 miles in New Mexico and another covering 5 miles in Yuma, Arizona.  While the order applied only to those first-in-line projects, Gilliam made clear that he felt the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups were likely to prevail at trial in their argument that the president was ignoring Congress' wishes by diverting Defense Department money.  \"Congress's 'absolute' control over federal expenditures - even when that control may frustrate the desires of the Executive Branch regarding initiatives it views as important - is not a bug in our constitutional system. It is a feature of that system, and an essential one,\" the judge wrote.  Gilliam went a step further Friday by ruling definitively that the administration couldn't use Pentagon counterdrug money for the two projects covered in his May order or to replace 63 miles in the Border Patrol's Tucson, Arizona, sector and 15 miles in its El Centro, California, sector.  Mr. Trump immediately vowed to appeal.  At stake is billions of dollars that would allow Mr. Trump to make progress on a major 2016 campaign promise heading into his race for a second term.  Mr. Trump declared a national emergency after losing a fight with the Democratic-led House that led to the 35-day shutdown. Congress agreed to spend nearly $1.4 billion on barriers in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings, which was well below the $5.7 billion the president requested.  Mr. Trump grudgingly accepted the money but declared the emergency to siphon money from other government accounts, finding up to $8.1 billion for wall construction. The money includes $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion from Defense Department counterdrug activities and $600 million from the Treasury Department's asset forfeiture fund.  Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper has yet to approve transferring the military construction funds. The Treasury Department funds have so far survived legal challenges.  The president's adversaries say the emergency declaration was an illegal attempt to ignore Congress. The ACLU sued on behalf of the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition.  The administration said the U.S. needed emergency protection to fight drug smuggling. Its arguments did not mention illegal immigration or unprecedented numbers of Central American families seeking asylum at the U.S. border, which have dominated public attention in recent months.  Justice Department attorneys argued that the freeze on Pentagon funds showed a \"fundamental misunderstanding of the federal appropriations process.\"  \"The real separation-of-powers concern is the district court's intrusion into the budgeting process,\" they wrote.  The two sides argued before a three-judge panel in San Francisco on June 20, made up of President Obama appointee Michelle Friedland and President George W. Bush appointees N. Randy Smith and Richard Clifton.  The administration has awarded $2.8 billion in contracts for barriers covering 247 miles, with all but 17 miles of that to replace existing barriers not expand coverage. It is preparing for a flurry of construction that the president is already celebrating at campaign-style rallies.  Mr. Trump inherited barriers spanning 654 miles, or about one-third of the border with Mexico. Of the miles covered under Trump-awarded contracts, more than half is with Pentagon money.  The Army Corps of Engineers recently announced several large Pentagon-funded contacts.  SLSCO Ltd. of Galveston, Texas, won a $789 million award to replace the New Mexico barrier. Southwest Valley Constructors of Albuquerque, New Mexico, won a $646 million award for the work in Tucson. Barnard Construction Co. of Bozeman, Montana, won a $141.8 million contract to replace barrier in Yuma and El Centro.\u00a0",

Amy Klobuchar downplayed concerns that many of the other 24 Democrats vying for the presidential nomination are embracing progressive policy proposals that may alienate some voters and push moderates like herself away from the party in 2020.\u00a0 \"I think there's room in our party for a legitimate debate,\" she said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"I just think it's important to realize there's a lot more that unifies us than separates [us], that there's a lot more that unifies us than there is that divides us.\" Klobuchar was asked specifically about the two nights of the first Democratic debate in Miami, in which the more progressive candidates on stage dominated the conversation, vowing to implement sweeping liberal policies on immigration, health care and climate change and cast aside more incremental, pragmatic approaches touted by previous candidates like Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.\u00a0 Current contenders like Juli\u00e1n Castro and Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders pledged to decriminalize illegal border crossings and enact single-payer health care systems that cover undocumented immigrants, and under Sanders' plan, that effectively shutter the private health insurance system.\u00a0 Klobuchar conceded there's a \"legitimate policy argument\" among the largest Democratic primary field in U.S. history. She said she supports bold proposals to create a \"Medicare for All\" system and make college more affordable, but that her plans to enact such changes differ from those of other contenders.\u00a0 \"I want universal health care, I just got a different way to get there,\" she said. \"And as I said in the debate, I don't think that we should take away people's right to their private insurance and kick half of America off of their private insurance.\" However, Klobuchar stressed that all candidates should be focused on their foremost priority: thwarting President Trump's reelection bid next year.\u00a0 The Minnesota Democrat said the great political divide that exists right now in the country is not between Democrats, but between the American public and the president, who she accused of failing to keep his word on campaign pledges.\u00a0 \"He promised them pharmaceutical prices going down, they've gone up. He promised them infrastructure, he has done nothing. He promised them a safer world when he got out of the Iranian agreement. It is not safer,\" Klobuchar said. \"That's the case we need to make.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

Beto O'Rourke, a Democratic candidate for president, denounced the Trump administration's controversial \"Remain in Mexico\" policy for asylum seekers, accusing the U.S. government of forcing desperate migrants into precarious situations in Mexico.\u00a0 \"This inhumane policy is causing suffering and death,\" O'Rourke said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\u00a0 Under the policy, officially called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) by the administration, migrants who claim asylum at certain ports of entry along the southwestern border are required to wait in Mexico while their cases are adjudicated in the U.S. Although it's currently in place in San Diego, Calexico and El Paso, the administration has vowed to expand the program, which is being challenged in court, along the entire southern border. The White House is betting on the policy, which has now returned more than 15,000 asylum seekers to Mexico, to curb large-scale migration from Central America. But immigrant advocates, lawyers and even some current asylum officers overseeing the program have said the practice violates U.S. and international refugee law because it sends back asylum seekers to places where they may face persecution.\u00a0 These places include the Mexican border cities of Tijuana, Mexicali and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, which borders El Paso, the city O'Rourke represented in Congress.\u00a0 \"Through a program that effectively shuts them out of this country and our laws, [migrants] are forced to stay in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, where they are prey to criminal organizations, where they are penniless and where they are suffering, and where too many feel like they are forced to try to cross in between our ports of entry,\" O'Rourke said.\u00a0 The former Texas congressman is set to visit Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez later on Sunday to meet with migrants returned under the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy. Since the Trump administration began turning back asylum seekers at the El Paso port of entry, thousands of migrants have been stranded in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, one of the most violent cities in the Western Hemisphere, looking for shelter, employment and legal representation while they await their day in court in the U.S.\u00a0 O'Rourke said he's hoping his visit to the Mexican border city will shine a spotlight on one of the Trump administration's lesser-known immigration policies and its impact of thousands of migrants.\u00a0 \"Going to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico and meeting with these asylum seekers is a great way for the American public to know what is being done in our name right now,\" he said.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

In front of the crowd at a packed Amway Center, Mr. Trump said his administration would work to cure cancer and again vowed to eradicate AIDS if he's elected to a second term.\u00a0 The president spent much of his speech attacking familiar foes and restating his position on issues like immigration. But he also said his administration will \"come up with the cures\" to devastating diseases. \"We will push onward with new medical frontiers,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We will come up with the cures to many, many problems, to many, many diseases including cancer and others. And we're getting closer all the time.\" The remarks came after his son, Donald Trump Jr., mocked Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden for making a similar promise to cure cancer. \"Wow, why the hell didn't you do that over the last 50 years, Joe?\" Trump Jr. tweeted.\u00a0 Biden, whose son Beau Biden died from brain cancer in 2015, founded the Biden Cancer Initiative and told the crowd at a recent campaign event in Iowa, \"I promise you, if I'm elected president, you're going to see the single most important thing that changes America \u2014 we're going to cure cancer.\" In 2018, an estimated 1,735,350 new cases of cancer were diagnosed in the United States and 609,640 people died from the disease, according to the\u00a0American Cancer Society's latest statistics.\u00a0 President Trump also called attention at his rally to the fight against HIV and AIDS. In his State of the Union address earlier this year, he vowed to eradicate AIDS by 2030 \u2014 though critics pointed out his budget proposal the previous year sought to divert money away from HIV/AIDS research to fund detention centers for undocumented immigrant children.\u00a0 In its 2020 budget proposal, the Trump administration has requested $291 million for the first phase of an initiative to reduce new HIV infections in the U.S. The budget also calls for an increase in funding for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, to pay for health care services and support, and another $50 million to expand access to the anti-HIV\u00a0drug regimen known as PrEP.\u00a0 \"We will eradicate AIDS in America once and for all \u2014 and we are really close,\" the president said at his Orlando rally. Approximately 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV today, according to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0 Some observers couldn't help but wonder about the feasibility of the president's big promises, which also included a vow to send astronauts to Mars.

Jim Acosta: \"You're saying something that's just patently untrue.\"Sarah Huckabee Sanders: \"Stating their policy positions is not 'patently untrue.'\" And often it's the press vs. the president. Jim Acosta, chief White House correspondent for CNN, has had his fair share of heated exchanges with President Trump. In November following the midterm election, Acosta had this exchange in which he struggled to maintain control of the microphone:  Acosta: \"If I may ask on the Russia investigation. Are you concerned that you may have indictments \u2014\"Mr. Trump: \"I'm not concerned about anything with the Russia investigation because it's a hoax.\"Acosta: \"That you may indictments coming down? Are you \u2014\"Mr. Trump: \"That's enough. Put down the mic.\"Acosta: \"Mr. President, are you worried about indictments coming down in this investigation?\"Mr. Trump: \"I'll tell you what: CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person.\" That exchange led the White House to revoke Acosta's press pass. CNN took it to court, and Acosta is back on the job. Whether he's a villain, a hero, or something in-between, Acosta is not about to take a back seat in the Briefing Room. Correspondent Chip Reid asked, \"Now, there are two basic criticisms of you from some of your colleagues, and certainly from the White House, and one of them is that you grandstand, that you sometimes make the news rather than report on the news. Is that a valid criticism?\" \"I know folks are going to say that. I look at it as I'm doing my job,\" Acosta replied. \"I see this as a very serious, serious moment in our nation's history. And I think, to some extent, we have been trying to figure out the best way to cover this president.\"  \"Do you think you've found the best way to cover him? Confront him? Challenge him?\" \"I think I've found the best way for me.\" But his way has not only brought attention to himself (including death threats on social media), but to his network (such as a pipe bomb sent to CNN's offices in New York). \"The man who sent the pipe bombs to CNN and other Democratic targets in the fall of 2018, on his social media account, he was directing death threats at me,\" Acosta said. \"Something along the lines of, 'You're next. You're the enemy of America,' and so on. And so, my sense of it is that what started off as an act for the president, calling us 'fake news,' calling us the 'enemy of the people' and so on, has gotten out of control. And they don't know how to reel it back in.\" In his new book titled \"The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America,\" Acosta recounts his past few years on the political beat, first covering candidate Trump, then President Trump. The title refers to a label Mr. Trump has personally attached to Acosta. \"He did at that press conference right after the midterms,\" Acosta said. (\"When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.\") Talk about what we've been through over these last two years, not just during the first two years of this administration, but also the campaign. People forget about what happened during the campaign. You know, the Trump press corps would walk into an arena and thousands of people would start shouting at us all sorts of things. And then-candidate Donald Trump would refer to us as the 'disgusting news media,' the 'dishonest news media,' 'liars,' 'scum,' and so on.\" Reid asked, \"So, is that why you decided to write a book? Did you feel people needed to know? Or did you also feel perhaps you needed to explain yourself in some way?\" \"Well, I wanted to do both. But mainly, Chip, you know, my feeling is \u2013 and I feel strongly about this \u2013 I don't want my children to grow up in a country where the press is called the enemy of the people. It's as simple as that.\" Acosta is the son of a Cuban immigrant father and an American-born mother. Despite his heritage, though, immigration is not the only issue that made him want to delve deeper \u2013 or, as his critics might say, \"go on the attack.\" A major turning point, says Acosta, was the president's reaction to the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017, where Mr. Trump contended that there were \"very fine people on both sides.\" \"I think that that was a very important moment, not just for the press, but for the American people,\" said Acosta. \"I don't believe that there are two sides to a story when it's a matter of right versus wrong. It just doesn't work that way. And I think that in this era, reporters have been thrust into a position where, you know, we are not only calling balls and strikes, but we are calling fouls.\"  These days, White House briefings are few and far between, making it harder for the media to call any of the shots. Since the beginning of the year, Acosta said, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has only held two briefings. \"But you've been a critic of those press briefings,\" Reid said. \"Is it really a big loss not to have them?\" \"I think it is a big loss,\" Acosta replied, \"because, I mean almost as important as what they say in the briefings in response to our questions is what they don't say, and how they don't want to answer the questions and avoid the questions. And so, I would love to see those briefings come back.  \"I get passionate about it and maybe people say, 'Oh, you're outside your lane,' and so on. It's just, I don't want that way of life to change for us. And so, yeah, it's worth fighting for, it's worth shouting questions to make sure that they're held accountable on this sort of thing.  \"I want my kids to grow up in a country where, you know, we can still shout questions at the president. He can take it. He's the president, right?\" \"He can handle it?\" \"He can handle it.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Story produced by Amy Wall.",

And it's across the board. It's American consumers.\" Some Senate Republicans appear to be discussing plans to block Mr. Trump's planned tariffs, although they are hopeful a solution can be reached with Mexico during talks this week, CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan, Alan He and Nancy Cordes report.\u00a0 \"There have been some Republicans who have stood up and boldly said this is a bad idea,\" said Phillips. \"We are simply asking them [Republicans] to go back to the bedrock principles, your roots and do the right thing here.\"\u00a0 But Phillips also noted it is difficult to compete with what he called Mr. Trump's \"megaphone.\" \"But the president, regardless of party, they do have a bully pulpit, and that's not just a cliche, that's the reality. They have a megaphone every day to be able dominate media coverage and a national conversation,\" Phillips said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump appeared to use that megaphone Tuesday during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Theresa May in London. When asked about Republicans discussing a move to block his tariffs, the Mr. Trump appeared unconcerned. \"Oh, I don't think they will do that. I think if they do, it's foolish,\" Mr. Trump said. He also cited what he called an \"all-time record\" level of support among Republicans.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said last week he will impose a 5% tariffs on goods coming from Mexico starting on June 10 \"until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied,\" referring to the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross the U.S. border. Phillips, meanwhile, said he is worried about rhetoric turning into reality on the threat of tariffs.\u00a0 \"It is worrisome with this relationship we have with Mexico with these tariffs,\" Phillips said. \"We hope it's just rhetoric, we do, but it's worrisome given the track record over the last two years.\"  Part Two of Tim Phillips' interview with Tanya Rivero will air Wednesday Red & Blue at 5 p.m. Phillips and Rivero will discuss the role of \u00a0\"Americans for Prosperity\" and the Koch network in the 2020 election, and why the organization is choosing to not back a presidential candidate.\u00a0 Clarification: An earlier version of this story said American for Prosperity is backed by Charles and David Koch, but David Koch retired in 2018.

This weekend's convention is the largest gathering of Democratic presidential candidates so far this year with at least 14 slated to appear. Biden,  however, is planning to speak at a Human Rights Campaign dinner in Columbus, Ohio.  Sen.

            "article_content": "How many stars in the American flag?\u00a0 Fifty, you say? I'm not sure. If there were fifty, then citizens of liberal states and conservative states would join in common purpose on the blue field which is, after all, called, \"the union.\"  Instead, it seems, we are recklessly tugging at the thread that holds us together. Today, liberals and conservatives barricade themselves in digital citadels where some media, with calculated bias, assure their viewers that what they already believe is correct. If we wall ourselves in castles of confirming information, I fear a new Cold War. This time, a cold civil war.  Given this danger, why do both parties promote almost nothing but divisive scandals? Because it is so much easier than health insurance or immigration reform. Taking on actual challenges would require work, and listening, and thought, and union.  Whose fault is this? Not the politicians, really. The Constitution was written on the premise that \"We the people\" would be hard-working citizens. But, by and large, we don't study the issues. Politicians lie because we don't know the facts. They dangle shiny new scandals because we allow ourselves to be mesmerized. We're asked to vote in federal elections once every two years \u2013 and half of us cannot find the time. Have we become too lazy in mind and body to support a democracy? I don't see that in the Americans I've met. I've witnessed devotion to all of our stars among the firefighters who sacrificed themselves at the World Trade Center; an Air Force nurse in Iraq who opened her own veins to give blood to a dying Marine; the mothers and fathers of Sandy Hook who dedicated their lives to preventing the kind of mass shooting that took their children. What's required of the rest of us is a small sacrifice to keep democracy vibrant and alive.  \"United we stand\" is a familiar aspiration. But \"divided we stand\" is the secret of America.  With all our diversity, in all our languages, we should agree on one big idea: we are all woven into the tapestry of stars. It's time to see that, not as a right, but as a privilege that each of us is willing to earn, with minds that are skeptical but open, and hands ready to work and willing to embrace.  You were right, of course; there are fifty stars. The flag we say we honor is the very icon of compromise.  How many stars in your flag? \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0See also:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Story produced by Aria Shavelson. Correspondent, \"60 Minutes\"",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado that aired Sunday, May 12, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Colorado Democratic Senator Michael Bennet. He's running for president, and he joins us from the campaign trail in Des Moines, Iowa. Good morning to you. Sir, you sit on the Senate Intelligence Committee. The decision to serve a subpoena to the president's son set off this firestorm among Republicans who were saying, \"The Mueller report is in, let's just move on.\" If Mueller chose not to prosecute and he had access to the transcripts from Congress's interview with Donald Trump Jr., what more is this? Why is this necessary? SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: Well, first- first of all, Congress's business here is not to- it- we're- we're not doing a criminal investigation. This is not about prosecuting anybody. This is about understanding how serious, and it was profoundly serious, the Russian's interference in our elections were in 2016, an interference that the president of the United States refuses to acknowledge. And then I would say second, with respect to the Mueller Report, this is just in the early days.\u00a0 I know the president and his attorney general and allies would like to just wish the report away, but the American people are just starting to see this report. The Congress has not yet received an unredacted version of the report. We have not yet seen the underlying documents for the report and the report is report that conclusively says that the- the special prosecutor could not clear the president of obstruction of justice. So, I think while they want to- they do want to wish it away, I think that Congress has an important oversight role to perform here, including the Senate intel- Intelligence Committee. MARGARET BRENNAN: So it- it sounds like you're saying Republicans may be overreacting? SEN. BENNET: I think that what you've had is a sequence of events that started with the attorney general of the United States acting like the president's defense lawyer and summarizing Mueller's document falsely and implying that somehow the document didn't show wrongdoing by the president. And Republicans like Mitch McConnell have taken advantage of- of that false summary- summary that Mueller has said is false and have said, \"case closed.\" And we haven't- the American people haven't even heard Bob Mueller testify yet. So, I think that they ought to allow this to take its course. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well Bob Mueller had an issue with context, I don't know if he used the word false. But in- in terms of the Mueller report, it- it did make clear, as you have said in your personal view, that the president committed impeachable offenses. That sounds like you're saying you support impeachment. What is the point of that process if it's just going to be dead on arrival in a Republican controlled Senate? SEN. BENNET: Well, I've said that I don't- I- I'm not ready to say the president should be impeached. I said that he- I think it looks from the report as though he's committed impeachable offenses. I think there is every reason why the investigation in the Congress should continue and then we should make an assessment of where it leads. You're quite right that as long as the Republicans are in charge of the Senate and they are- want to bury their heads in the sand about what's going on here that it's unlikely that that process will go through all the way to the end, which is why I think Nancy Pelosi has wanted to say, let's not jump to a conclusion on impeachment yet. Let's let the process go forward and see where it takes us. And by the way, ultimately I think where it will take us is to replacing Donald Trump in 2020, which is what we need to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well and that's something that you personally would like to see happen there. As- as we mentioned you are in the field yourself. You wrote an op-ed recently saying that while you do support a hardline approach to China, you think President Trump has been really bad for farmers. Do you support a third bailout for farmers? SEN. BENNET: I- I- I think it shouldn't be necessary. I think- look Donald Trump has shown himself to be the most fiscally irresponsible president we have had in generations. Here's a guy who's managed to rack up a two trillion dollar deficit at a moment of full employment in the country. It is almost impossible to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what would you do differently-- SEN. BENNET: And his solution-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --if you are commander in chief-- SEN. BENNET: What I would do-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --leading these talks? SEN. BENNET: Yeah. What- what I would do differently is mobilize the world against China's mercantilist trading policies, which the president is right to point out have been unfair. But putting tariffs on our allies, putting tariffs on even the Chinese that are actually taxes on American producers, American farmers, taxes on the American consumer and taxes on the American worker, I think are completely the wrong way of doing this, and I can assure you the Chinese have a longer attention span that Donald Trump has.\u00a0 So I have just spent three- two days with farmers in Iowa. I've spent time with farmers all over my state as well. They- they were facing low commodity prices. They're- in my state, they're facing drought. In Iowa, they're facing flooding and- and now on top of that, they're facing the retribution by- by- by our trading partners and our foes. And that's a direct consequence of the president's immigration- or trade policies. His immigration policies also have been terrible for farmers in my state. People are selling their equipment because they can't hire people to be able to do the work they need to keep their farm or their ranch or their dairy operation in business. And- and it's ironic because he- he has such massive support among so many of these folks, but we'll see what happens over time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright, Senator Bennet, as we said you are on the campaign trail, we appreciate you joining us today. We'll be back in one minute with an interview with former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Stay with us.",

Switzerland has been helping the U.S. handle the increasingly rocky relationship with Tehran.\u00a0 The Iranians have made overtures through the Swiss in past months to offer discussion of U.S. prisoners. More recently and overtly, Mr. Trump said he wanted the Iranians to call him.\u00a0 The White House announced the visit late Wednesday night, short notice for a visit with a foreign dignitary. \"President Donald J. Trump will meet with the president of the Swiss Confederation Ueli Maurer at the White House on May 16, 2019,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Wednesday. \"The two leaders will discuss the partnership between the United States and Switzerland, including matters such as Switzerland's role in facilitating diplomatic relations and other international issues.\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the White House believes Iran is \"not gonna like\" what Mr. Trump does in response if they take any action against the United States.\u00a0 \"They're not gonna be happy,\" Sanders told reporters on the White House North Lawn.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the president is announcing his proposal to change the composition of legal immigrants in the U.S. with a plan that's still light on specifics. Mr. Trump is announcing \"his thoughts\" on immigration in the White House Rose Garden Thursday afternoon, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday. It's unclear why the White House is releasing such a plan now, without any confirmed conversations yet with Democrats and no plan to address the undocumented population, rendering final passage seemingly unlikely in a Democratic-controlled House.\u00a0 Asked how the White House argues the plan is anything more than a reelection strategy without Democrats' input, the senior administration official said, \"If they don't want to engage then it would be part of the election. If they want to engage it could be part of the negotiation. That's gonna be up to them.\"",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris is proposing a series of executive actions she would take as president to enact gun control policies if Congress failed to pass comprehensive legislation within the first 100 days of her administration. The California senator previewed the plan during a town hall Monday night on CNN, and her campaign plans to unveil the full proposal Tuesday, according to a campaign aide. \"Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action and specifically what I would do is put in a requirement for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns,\" she said Monday. \"I will require for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license.\" Her plan calls for executive action to implement \"near-universal\" background checks, close loopholes to prevent those convicted of domestic violence from obtaining firearms and revoke licenses from gun manufacturers and dealers who break the law, according to a copy of the plan obtained by CBS News. The proposal by Harris, a former prosecutor, comes as Democratic presidential candidates have been embracing tougher gun laws on the campaign trail, a sign of growing frustration on the issue within the party and among the broader public. Harris, who has said she owns a gun, is the first among the crowded field of candidates to detail a plan and vow to take executive action if Congress doesn't pass comprehensive reforms. Harris' plan would direct the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to define a \"gun dealer\" as anyone who sells five or more guns for profit per year, subjecting them to federal laws requiring conduct background checks on all sales. Harris would issue the order if Congress failed to pass universal background checks within her first 100 days in office. Harris would also reverse a Trump administration policy that narrowed the definition of \"a fugitive of justice,\" leading to the removal of tens of thousands of names from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Under the current policy, only fugitives who have crossed state lines to avoid charges are prohibited from purchasing a gun. Harris would order the ATF to bar anyone with an outstanding arrest warrant from buying a gun.  The senator's plan also focuses on a 2005 law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which restricts lawsuits by victims of gun violence against manufacturers and retailers. Harris supports a repeal of the law and, absent congressional action, would direct the ATF to revoke the licenses of manufacturers and dealers who violate negligence, nuisance and marketing laws. Additionally, Harris would order the government to take \"the most egregious actors to court for criminal liability.\" Harris would also direct the ATF to issue a regulation closing the so-called \"boyfriend loophole\" to prevent those convicted of domestic violence from purchasing a firearm. Current law bars convicted abusers from purchasing firearms, but only applies to those who were married to, lived with or had a child with the victim. Additionally, the senator reiterated her support for legislation to make gun trafficking a federal crime, ban high capacity magazines and ban anyone convicted of a federal hate crime from purchasing a firearm. Peter Ambler, executive director of the advocacy group Giffords, said the plan sends \"a powerful signal to the country and voters that Kamala is going to make gun violence prevention a core part of her candidacy and her presidency.\" \"The politics have fundamentally changed,\" Ambler said. \"You've got a remarkable level of cohesion in terms of candidates' commitment to addressing gun violence ... It's become a threshold, litmus-test issue for Democrats.\" Gun restriction legislation has been elusive on Capitol Hill. Mass shootings in Sandy Hook, Las Vegas and Parkland, Florida, have failed to spur successful congressional action on even modest proposals. Any attempt to use executive action to restrict access to firearms would face vigorous legal opposition from guns rights groups like the National Rifle Association. A\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0taken in February, one year after the Parkland shooting, found 64 percent of Americans are frustrated by the political debate over gun policy, and 75 percent said it was unlikely that Mr. Trump and Congress would make significant changes to gun policy by the end of the year.  The survey also found that 56 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be more strict, while 13 percent said they should be less strict and 31 percent said they should be kept as they are. The survey found a partisan split, with 84 percent of Democrats calling for stricter measures and only 31 percent of Republicans advocating for tougher laws. But 51 percent of independents say gun laws should be stricter.  But as a voting issue, gun policy isn't typically a top driver among voters. In 2018, 60 percent of voters favored stricter gun measures, according to CBS News exit polling. But only 10 percent of voters said it was a top issue. Health care, immigration and the economy outweighed gun policy as voters' top issues in the 2018 midterms.\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Washington -- President Trump is proposing charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications as he continues to try to blunt the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S. In a presidential memorandum signed Monday, Mr. Trump directed his attorney general and acting homeland security secretary to take additional measures to overhaul the asylum system, which he insists \"is in crisis\" and plagued by \"rampant abuse.\" The changes are just the latest in a series of proposals from an administration that is struggling to cope with a surge of migrant families arriving at the Southern border that has overwhelmed federal resources and complicated Mr. Trump's efforts to claim victory at the border as he runs for re-election. Most of those arriving say they are fleeing violence and poverty and many request asylum under U.S. and international law. The Trump administration has frequently blamed U.S. laws protecting asylum seekers for encouraging them to seek that status in the U.S. But immigrant advocates say the administration's policies are unfair to those who would qualify for asylum. As part of the memo, Mr. Trump is giving officials 90 days to come up with new regulations to ensure that applications are adjudicated within 180 days of filing, except under exceptional circumstances. And he is directing officials to begin charging a fee to process asylum and employment authorization applications - which don't currently require payment. The White House and DHS officials didn't immediately respond to questions about how much applicants might be forced to pay, and it was unclear how many families fleeing poverty would be able to afford such a payment. The memo says the price wouldn't exceed the cost of processing applications, but officials didn't immediately provide an estimate for what that might be. Mr. Trump also wants to bar anyone who has entered or tried to enter the country illegally from receiving a provisional work permit and is calling on officials to immediately revoke work authorizations when individuals are denied asylum and ordered removed from the country. He is also calling on the Department of Homeland Security to reassign immigration officers and any other staff \"to improve the integrity of adjudications of credible and reasonable fear claims, to strengthen the enforcement of the immigration laws, and to ensure compliance with the law by those aliens who have final orders of removal.\" Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months, with border agents making more than 100,000 arrests or denials of entry in March, a 12-year high.",

            "article_content": "Helsinki -- The new interior minister of Estonia on Thursday called the country's first female president an \"emotionally heated woman\" for walking out during the swearing-in of a Cabinet minister accused of domestic violence. Mart Helme made the sexist remark as other European politicians expressed alarm at the fact that both he and his son, also a newly-appointed Estonian government minister from the same far-right party, have recently and publicly flashed the \"OK\" hand gesture. While their use of the gesture may have been intended as innocent enthusiasm, the hand signal has been co-opted by supporters of white supremacy. Helme made the \"heated woman\" remark a news conference where he also accused Estonian news outlets of applying a double standard in covering abuse allegations against the now-former minister from his own far-right Estonian Conservative People's Party, or ERKE. President Kersti Kaljulaid, the first woman to serve as the Baltic country's head of state, left a Monday swearing-in ceremony for a new three-party government when it was time for the appointee at issue to take the oath of office. Marti Kuusik was sworn in as technology and foreign trade minister along with the rest of Prime Minister Juri Ratas' Cabinet after news reports featured the domestic violence allegations. Police opened an investigation to review the allegations hours later. Kuusik, a member of Helme's ERKE party, resigned the next day, saying the probe was based on \"slander\" and \"a terrifying media attack\" against him. Helme called the reporting \"an unconstitutional witch hunt.\" He also made clear his dim view of the president's decision to walk out during the ceremony and return to her seat when it was the next minister's turn. \"An emotionally heated woman can afford to do that,\" Helme told reporters. \"But Kersti Kaljulaid is not simply a woman, but the president of the republic.\" \"She reads one article, becomes so emotionally upset as a woman that she makes a decision right away,\" he added. Kaljulaid, who has been president since October 2016, did not respond Thursday to Helme's comments. Helme and his son, newly appointed Finance Minister Martin Helme, have accused the news media before of displaying a negative bias toward the Estonian Conservative People's Party, or ERKE. The party has advocated abolishing legal recognition for same-sex civil unions, demanded changes to the abortion law and fiercely opposed European Union quotas for taking in asylum-seekers. Photographs of the two flashing the OK hand sign at Monday's swearing-in ceremony have received attention from other politicians. The use of the familiar gesture by some extreme-right activists and white supremacists has given it an alternative meaning. Mart Helme hasn't responded to questions about his and his son's hand motions, but his son told Politico just an hour before throwing up both hands in OK gestures after he was sworn in earlier this week that, \"No one will tell us what words we can say or what signs we can make.\"\u00a0 The country's former President Toomas Hendrik Ilves posted a tweet on Monday with photos of both Helmes giving the signal, accusing them of doing so with nefarious intent. Estonian ministers of Finance and Internal Affairs, giving the white power sign at their swearing-in ceremony before Parliament today. pic.twitter.com/VHQAmTW2dv Former Swedish top diplomat Carl Bildt said he was also \"genuinely worried\" about the public display as he retweeted Ilves' post. Martin Helme, who told Politico that U.S. President Donald Trump was \"absolutely\" an inspiration to him, has been quoted previously as calling for a \"white Estonia.\" \"Our immigration policy should have one simple rule: if you're black, go back. As simple as that,\" he said in 2013 according to Estonian news website ERR. The OK hand signal gained popularity in 2017 as an inside joke among white supremacists online, who wrote about tricking liberals and the media into thinking the popular OK gesture had been co-opted by far-right groups, according to the\u00a0Anti-Defamation League. But the joke eventually turned serious as white supremacists groups and figures, such as Richard Spencer in the U.S., continued to pose with it in photos and spread its use on social media. EKRE entered Estonia's parliament in 2015. It emerged from the country's March 3 election with 17.8% of the vote to become the third-largest party in the national legislature. A party member is the current parliament speaker. The party's role in governing expanded Thursday with Mart Helme's appointment as first deputy prime minister, a position that includes leading the Cabinet during the prime minister's absence.",

            "article_content": "Berlin -- An American art museum is demanding that a German far-right party stop using one of its paintings, portraying a 19th-century slave auction, in a campaign poster for the European elections. \"We are strongly opposed to the use of this work to advance any political agenda,\" Olivier Meslay, the director of the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts, told The Associated Press. \"We did not supply the painting to the AfD,\" he said, using the acronym for the party Alternative for Germany. The 1866 oil-on-canvas painting \"Slave Market,\" by Jean-Leon Gerome, shows a black, apparently Muslim slave trader displaying a naked young woman with much lighter skin to a group of men for examination. The AfD's Berlin branch said they put up 30 posters of the painting across the German capital with the slogan: \"So that Europe won't become Eurabia.\" The party, known for its anti-Muslim stance, said it won't take down any of the posters. Meslay said the museum had written to the party \"insisting that they cease and desist in using this painting.\" However, he acknowledged, the painting is in the public domain and \"there are no copyrights or permissions that allow us to exert control over how it is used other than to appeal to civility on the part of the AfD Berlin.\" A spokesman for the Berlin branch of the AfD called the museum's request \"a futile attempt to gag the AfD.\" \"The German public has the right to find out about the truth about the possible consequences of illegal mass immigration,\" said Ronald Glaeser. He did not explain further. The AfD and other far-right groups have blamed Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to allow in hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers from war-torn countries like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan for multiple social problems. Some far-right supporters argue that migrants are responsible for an increase in serious crimes, especially attacks on women. Last summer they paraded through the eastern town of Chemnitz carrying posters of German women they allege were killed by migrants. President Trump has echoed the AfD's claims about crime and migrants in tweets, urging Americans to shun an influx of refugees. He tweeted last year that, \"crime in Germany is up 10% plus\" since Merkel's decision to welcome migrants. He even suggested the German government was trying to obscure the figures.\u00a0 The claim is objectively false; crime actually fell in 2017 by 9.6 percent in Germany, with violent crime falling 2.4 percent,\u00a0according to Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office. Crimes by non-German suspects fell by 22 percent in 2017. \u00a0 Glaeser complained that opponents of the AfD have been continually destroying this and other campaign posters in Berlin and that party workers have had to repeatedly put up new copies, only to see them destroyed again the following night. The AfD was founded in 2013 and elected to Germany's national parliament for the first time in 2017.",

But several longtime and prominent board members told The Associated Press they were standing by LaPierre, who has symbolized the gun-rights movement for decades with his unwavering support of the Second Amendment. \"Wayne has the confidence of a strong majority of the board,\" said Todd Rathner, a board member from Arizona who began his tenure shortly after one of the last upheavals within the organization in the 1990s. \"They trust him. They know that he's the face of the NRA. And quite frankly I think that anybody that wants to remove him, they're going to have to get through this board first.\" The NRA is holding its 148th annual meeting in Indianapolis and the gathering began with a considerable buzz after the NRA filed a lawsuit against Ackerman McQueen, the public relations firm that has earned tens of millions of dollars in the decades since it began shaping the gun lobby's fierce talking points. North is aligned with the public relations firm \u2014 and at odds with LaPierre and some board members who believe the group's media operation and messaging have strayed too far from the NRA's original mission of gun safety and the outdoors. Of particular concern to some board members and rank-and-file is the fiery tone of NRATV, the media arm of the NRA that was created and is operated by Ackerman McQueen. North, best known for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, has a $1 million contract with Ackerman McQueen. That has raised alarm bells within the NRA about conflicts of interest. A spokesman for North did not return a message requesting comment. The dispute played out as President Trump spoke to the convention Friday and vowed to protect gun rights in the 2020 elections and efforts by Democrats to disarm law-abiding Americans. Ackerman McQueen has been by the NRA's side for two decades and has crafted its aggressive messaging, including the \"From my cold dead hands\" line uttered by actor Charlton Heston in 2000 as he vowed to resist any effort to take away his guns. NRATV, the online channel whose hosts not only aggressively defend the NRA and its cause but often venture into political debates not directly related to firearms, such as immigration or diversity on even children's TV. In its lawsuit, the NRA said some of its members have questioned NRATV's weighing in on \"topics far afield of the Second Amendment.\" \"I cannot speak for all board members. I hope all board members are paying close attention to what's really going on here. I have served this organization as a board member for over 30 years and as its Florida lobbyist for over 40 years,\" said Marion Hammer, a former NRA president and credited with successfully using Florida as a test kitchen for new gun-rights initiatives. \"I have known and worked with Wayne LaPierre for over 30 years and I know this man. My loyalty to Wayne LaPierre is 110 percent because I know his loyalty to the NRA is 110 percent. \"Wayne LaPierre works for the NRA. His loyalty is to the NRA. Oliver North is employed by Ackerman McQueen, a vendor of the NRA. And it is clear that his loyalty is to Ackerman McQueen,\" she added. It is rare for the NRA to betray any hint of internal turmoil. But it erupted very publicly in recent weeks after the NRA sued Ackerman McQueen, accusing it of refusing to hand over financial records to account for its billings. In 2017 alone, the NRA paid the firm $40 million. The NRA has faced some financial struggles in recent years, prompting some to question whether the millions spent on public relations and NRATV is worth the money. One NRATV segment in particular seemed to be the last straw for some members: It took the children's show \"Thomas & Friends\" to task for adding some ethnically and gender diverse characters to its lineup of talking locomotives and other vehicles. The segment featured several trains wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods and sitting on flaming tracks. Gun control advocates reveled in the Game of Thrones-style dispute, considering it an inevitable result of financial troubles and citing polls showing Americans are growing increasingly fond of restricting access to firearms. \"The evidence of the NRA's mismanagement and dysfunction is mounting by the day, and now its leaders are playing the blame game as to who's at fault,\" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. \"The bottom line is this: As the NRA plummets, the gun safety movement just keeps growing.\" A member meeting is set to be held Saturday, which may reveal whether rank-and-file are equally upset with the direction of the NRA. The board will meet Monday to vote on its leadership and that's where any action would be taken. Of the board members who spoke with the AP late Friday, all said they fully support LaPierre and have no intention of stripping him of his position. None would say if they thought North would survive a vote to remain as president, a position that is unpaid. Most NRA presidents are elected to two consecutive one-year terms, and North is closing in on the end of his first year. While LaPierre has been controversial over the years and draws the anger of gun-control groups, board members describe him as personable, hard-working and a fierce advocate of the Second Amendment. Tom King, a board member from New York for more than a decade, called him \"the single hardest-working individual that has done everything he can, dedicated his life to defending the Second Amendment.\"",

            "article_content": "Despite his low name recognition, Florida Mayor Wayne Messam says his experience leading the city of Miramar and his ability to \"live the American dream\" makes him qualified to join the already packed field of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders.\u00a0 \"When you compare mayors to Washington insiders, Americans see that mayors actually get the job done,\" Messam said during an appearance on CBSN on Wednesday. Messam cited his work in helping pass a living wage bill in his city as well as plans to forgive crippling student loan debt.\u00a0 \"When you think about the progress and the progressive issues we are tackling and solving in Miramar, I'm looking to take these issues nationally because the American people need someone who can champion these issues for them.\" But Messam isn't the only mayor in the 2020 field. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, while still in the exploratory phase of his 2020 campaign, has been seeing a surge of support after securing over $7 million in donations in the first quarter of 2019.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the Florida mayor, who said he dispatched police officers to respond to the deadly mass shooting in Parkland last year, said if elected, he would reduce gun violence by 50 percent the first 4 years in office. And by the end of his administration, he says he would end gun violence altogether.\u00a0 \"We cannot accept today the new norm that has come about in terms of mass shootings as well as violence on our streets,\" said Messam. \"Action must take place right now.\" Messam said since launching his campaign on March 30, his campaign has received contributions from 43 states and is \"on its way\" to reaching the Democratic National Committees requirement of 65,000 donors from 20 states in order to reach the debate stage.\u00a0 Many Democratic candidates have president embraced \"Medicare for All,\" a plan to give all American government-backed insurance. Messam, meanwhile, said that he would propose his own plan that would \"provide access to health care to all Americans.\" He called the Medicare for All plan \"plausible\" and said he would support expanding coverage. He noted, however, that he \"also believes in choice as well.\" \"I think a common sense approach that provides health care coverage to all Americans is the best way forward,\" he added.\u00a0 Messam said that the current crisis along the southern border is \"just a symptom of how Washington has failed the American people.\" He said that right now, the country needs \"comprehensive immigration reform\" but did not go into specifics as to what that reform would entail. \"We should provide a pathway for citizenship to those who are contributing to our society,\" said Messam. \u00a0 Messam said that he will be releasing his own tax returns and criticized President Trump for not releasing his.\u00a0 \"When you hide behind a veil of your financial business you never know who you're influencing, where your priorities lie. But I think it's important that the American people have some glimpse or some understanding of the financial standing of their commander-In-chief,\" said Messam.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "Washington -- Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York says her relationship with Hillary Clinton is strong and \u00a0Clinton has given her advice about her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Gillibrand, appearing in a town hall televised by CNN Tuesday night, fielded questions about her record, including policy shifts she's made on immigration and gun control, and offered an update on her long-standing relationship with Hillary and Bill Clinton. In 2017, Gillibrand said Bill Clinton should have resigned from the presidency after his inappropriate relationship with White House intern Monica Lewsinsky came to light two decades ago. Gillibrand said Tuesday her \"fondness\" and respect for Hillary Clinton are \"very strong\" and she continues to admire and look up to her. Gillibrand supported Clinton's 2016 Democratic presidential bid and took Clinton's U.S. Senate seat when Clinton was appointed secretary of state in 2009. \"Secretary Clinton is a role model for all of us,\" Gillibrand said. \"My views on her husband are very different. And I've said all I'm going to say about that.\" In a February interview with The Associated Press, Gillibrand said she had not yet spoken to Hillary Clinton about her campaign. Throughout the town hall, Gillibrand criticized President Trump and special interests in Washington, and called several times for publicly funded elections. Her biggest applause came after her answers on gun control and her plan to improve public education.\u00a0 Gillibrand hoped Tuesday's town hall would give her a fresh opportunity to introduce herself to the voters and donors she'll need to ensure her campaign stays on track, according to a person familiar with the campaign who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. The town hall came as the sprawling Democratic field continues to take shape. The first fundraising quarter just wrapped and gave an initial view of how the candidates are faring. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, along with Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, posted big numbers. But Gillibrand is among the candidates who haven't yet released word on what her campaign took in. Gillibrand began her campaign with $10 million cash on hand. The fundraising number isn't just about bragging rights. It's part of the criteria used to qualify for the first two presidential primary debates this summer. To get on the stage, a candidate must either reach 1 percent approval in three recognized polls or raise money from at least 65,000 donors across at least 20 states. Acknowledging potential fundraising trouble, Gillibrand aides said her path to the debate stage is through her standing in polls. There are reasons for optimism, her aides said. They said her online donors have doubled since March 17, when she officially launched her campaign. But they wouldn't disclose how many donors she has. The aides spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal campaign thinking. Gillibrand is betting that Tuesday's town hall gives her a fundraising boost, as it did for other candidates. Buttigieg, who was virtually unknown outside his state a few months ago, said he raised $600,000 in the 24 hours following his own appearance at a CNN town hall. Gillibrand's campaign views her candidacy in two distinct phases. The first \"exploratory\" phase began in January with a focus on introducing Gillibrand to voters. She appeared on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" quickly made her first trip to the leadoff caucus state of Iowa and held 60 events across eight states. The second phase began with the formal launch of her campaign on March 17. She's tried to make bolder and higher-profile moves since then. She participated in MSNBC's first town hall of the presidential season and became the first presidential candidate to release her 2018 tax returns. She pressed her rivals to follow suit. In a video released by her campaign, she described herself as \"brave,\" a theme that has been a cornerstone of the early days of her official bid. She has sold herself to voters as a candidate who is able to win in Republican strongholds, saying in Concord, New Hampshire, over the weekend that she'd won her first race for Congress in a district she described as \"red, red, red,\" and promised to do whatever she could to defeat President Trump. \"What he is creating is wrong,\" she said. \"It is immoral. It is harmful. It is hurtful.\" But she's faced setbacks through all stages of her candidacy. Gillibrand has faced criticism over the handling of a sexual harassment claim in her Senate office that resulted in a female staffer resigning over the office's handling of her accusation against a male aide. After Politico reported that the male aide was kept on and Gillibrand's office was presented with additional allegations, the male aide was fired. Gillibrand, who has been a champion of women and victims of sexual misconduct, has stood behind her office's response to the incident. Last month, she officially launched her campaign with a speech in the shadow of the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Manhattan and laced into him, mocking the president for the many properties that bear his name. \"He does this because he wants you to believe he's strong,\" she said. \"He is not. Our president is a coward.\" The event was billed as Gillibrand's first major speech of her campaign, with the intention of showing a sharp contrast between Gillibrand and the president. But it came mere hours before the Justice Department released the principal conclusions of the long-awaited report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and that overshadowed the speech. Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist, noted that the 2020 primary field is still growing and said Gillibrand has time to make her mark on the race. \"As long as she qualifies for those debates, she will have plenty of opportunity to make her case, to rise to the top, and pull ahead,\" Cardona said.",

The surveyed voters picked Biden, Harris and Warren as their top three second choices.\u00a0 The poll also asked likely voters about the top issues they want candidates to discuss on the campaign trail. According to the survey, more than half of them said health care should be the foremost priority, while 17 percent indicated environmental issues are important to them. The next four issues were immigration, education, job creation and thwarting President Trump's reelection bid.\u00a0 The Monmouth University poll, conducted between April 4 and 9 via telephone, surveyed 351 Iowa voters likely to attend February's Democratic caucuses.

            "article_content": "London --\u00a0As Britain approaches the date it is supposed to exit the European Union, the Brexit process is only getting more chaotic. The chance of the U.K. crashing out of the union it helped to create without any agreement in place on future relations is more likely than ever.\u00a0 With daily headlines about cabinet resignations, cross-party negotiations, deadline extensions and even a \"flextension,\" what are the facts?\u00a0 Fact: Currently, the cliff edge is April 12.\u00a0Source: European Union. But the U.K. has asked for an extension.\u00a0   Initially, the deadline for Britain to leave the European Union was March 29, 2019, but the EU granted the U.K. an extension. The bloc agreed to a delay, but demanded that lawmakers in London use the extra time to pass at least one key piece of Brexit legislation -- the Withdrawal Agreement -- by March 29. They failed to do that. The EU then let the deadline for the U.K. to pass a withdrawal agreement slide to April 12. \u00a0 On April 5, British Prime Minister Theresa May formally asked the European Union to delay Brexit until June 30, hoping to avoid a potentially damaging \"no-deal\" crash-out of the union on April 12.  Tusk made a counteroffer, proposing a longer, indefinite time frame. He urged 27 other EU states to offer the U.K. \"flextension\" -- a delay of up to a year. EU officials said Tusk was to try and get his concept approved at an EU summit scheduled for mid April. Both the U.K. and the EU have been trying to avoid Britain participating in upcoming European parliamentary elections, scheduled for May 23-26. But if Britain is still technically a member of the union at that point, it will have to field candidates under EU law. May has said she \"accepts\" that legal requirement, and her letter to Tusk requesting the end-of-June delay noted that her government was preparing contingency plans to field candidates. Fact: Approximately 3,500 people were killed in \"The Troubles,\" a decades-long violent conflict in Northern Island that ended in the 1990s. The end of that conflict opened up the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\u00a0Source: Malcolm Sutton's Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland, Ulster University\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The conflict that ended in the 1990s with the \"Good Friday Agreement\" has been one of the biggest thorns in the side of the British government's withdrawal deal. Theresa May's deal would put an end to free trade and free movement between Britain and EU countries. Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.) and the Republic of Ireland (an independent country and EU member) share a land border. That border has remained open as part of the peace agreement which put an end to decades of conflict. Ending free movement and trade between Britain and the EU would require some level of new border controls on that Irish border, and many fear that could stoke sectarian tensions still simmering beneath the surface, and jeopardize the hard-won peace. May's way around this problem in her draft deal with the EU is the so-called \"backstop,\" which states that the U.K. would effectively remain within the customs union with the EU until a solution for the Irish border can be negotiated and put in place. Critics point out, however, that that could be never. It was this \"backstop\" clause, and the possibility that it could keep Britain bound to EU customs rules indefinitely after Brexit, that made May's deal a no-go for many hardline \"Brexiteers\" in her party. Fact: There are approximately 3.7 million EU citizens living in the United Kingdom. An estimated 1.3 British-born people lived in other EU countries in 2017.\u00a0Source: UK Office for National Statistics and the United Nations. May's withdrawal agreement set out a plan for how to deal with the millions of EU citizens living in the U.K., many of whom have resided here for decades and never had to think about their immigration status. Under her plan, EU citizens living in Britain would have to apply for \"Settled Status,\" which would protect some of their rights -- primarily their rights to live and work in the U.K. Thousands have already applied. If the U.K. crashes out of the EU without a deal, the British government has said that Settled Status will still apply, though parts of the timetable will vary, including the period during which applications can be made. On Wednesday, the EU said British citizens would still be able to travel to and within the EU without a visa for up to 90 days, even if the U.K. crashes out with no deal. Rights groups have voiced concerns about whether EU citizens from vulnerable groups living in Britain, including the elderly and children in state care, will have the necessary support to apply for Settled Status. The process can be done either online or via a smart phone app. Fact: The opposition Labour Party's position is that it will back a second referendum, but only under certain circumstances.\u00a0Source: BBC News \u00a0 According to the BBC, opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has told members of his party that he would consider another public vote to prevent a \"damaging Tory Brexit,\" or a no-deal Brexit. May has been unable to get her draft deal passed by the House of Commons, where her own Conservative Party and its allies hold a majority, so she has reached out to Labour and Corbyn to try to cobble together enough votes across the aisle to get it approved.\u00a0 Corbyn may not ask for another referendum if he and May are able to reach a compromise deal. That would anger some members of his party, who want any agreement to be put to a public, confirmatory vote. It would also infuriate the hardcore pro-Brexit lawmakers in May's party, who would see any further compromise in favor of closer future ties with Europe as a betrayal of the 2016 referendum result calling for Brexit in the first place. Corbyn said the first day of negotiations on Wednesday was \"useful but inconclusive.\" Talks were expected to continue on Thursday. Fact: The United Kingdom is the U.S.'s top foreign investor. Source: CBS MoneyWatch The United Kingdom is the U.S.'s biggest foreign direct investor, and experts predict that its economy will take a hit if there is a no-deal Brexit. Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a statement urging the British government to come up with a solution to avoid crashing out of the EU. \"We urge MPs to find consensus immediately on a way forward that avoids what surely would be a disastrous development for consumers, workers and businesses alike,\" the statement said. A no-deal Brexit could disrupt global financial markets and be a \"system risk\" to American banks, according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Fact: If Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal, there will be no transition period. Source: Full Fact Under Theresa May's proposed deal, the U.K. would leave the EU and then have an extended transition period to negotiate its future relationship with the bloc. Without a deal, at midnight on April 12, Britain would simply cease to be a member of the European Union, facing new tariffs and border controls. Goods which had moved freely between EU countries for decades would likely be suddenly subjected to much higher tariffs. Economists have warned that Britain's residents could see price increases as well as shortages of food and medicine, and there could be major delays at ports as new customs regulations are put in place.\u00a0 While the government and the EU have been quietly planning for this contingency for months, even years, the truth is it remains unclear exactly how an unprecedented exit by an EU member state -- with, but especially without a deal -- could effect everyday life.

            "article_content": "New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand formally launched her presidential campaign Sunday morning, two months after she announced the creation of an exploratory committee, making it official with a tweeted campaign video. The video, titled \"Brave\" and narrated by Gillibrand, focuses on President Trump, though he is never mentioned by name. It shows a succession of TV news images \u2014 Mr. Trump waving on a stage, footage of the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, the opioid crisis, a National Rifle Association sign, the president criticizing a caravan of migrants, denying the existence of climate change and more. \"Brave doesn't pit people against each other. Brave doesn't put money over lives. Brave doesn't spread hate. Cloud truth. Build a wall. That's what fear does,\" Gillibrand said in the video, denouncing Mr. Trump's proposed border wall and the Muslim ban in accompanying images. I\u2019m running for president. Let\u2019s prove that brave wins. Join me: https://t.co/I1vp93LBUR pic.twitter.com/Giu4u4KEZQ Gillibrand mentions her policy priorities, which are similar to those enumerated by other Democrats in the field \u2014 including health care for all and passing a \"Green New Deal,\" the aspirational legislation to combat climate change introduced by her fellow New Yorker, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But she also tries to distinguish herself from the rest of the field by noting her opposition to the Wall Street bailout during the financial crisis, her efforts to curtail military sexual assault and her public release of her personal financial information. \"When  I voted against the Wall Street bailout while both parties threw billions at the banks, when I took on the Pentagon to end to sexual assault in the military,\" she said in the video. \"When I turned a red district blue against all odds, when I challenged Congress by making my meetings,  finances and taxes public.\"\u00a0 Gillibrand has faced criticism for conservative positions she has taken during her early tenure in the House, particularly her hardline stances on guns and illegal immigration. She was appointed to the Senate in 2009 to fill Hillary Clinton's seat when she became secretary of state. The senator from New York plans to make the first speech of her presidential campaign in her home state next Sunday in front of Trump International in Columbus Circle in New York City, the video said. The official launch of Gillibrand's campaign comes just days after Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman and failed Senate candidate from Texas, announced his presidential bid, attracting more attention, some complained, than any of the more experienced women pursuing the Democratic nomination.\u00a0 Gillibrand, a prominent advocate for the #MeToo movement, was the first senator to call on Sen. Al Franken to resign in 2017 based on allegations of sexual harassment. But she is now under scrutiny for her handling of a sexual harassment claim against a staffer in her Senate office last year. Gillibrand has defended her handling of the situation in her office, contending last week that the allegation was taken seriously \"every step\" of the way. \"These are challenges that affect all of our nation's workplaces, including mine, and the question is whether or not they are taken seriously. As I have long said, when allegations are made in the workplace, we must believe women so that serious investigations can actually take place, we can learn the facts, and there can be appropriate accountability. That's exactly what happened at every step of this case last year. I told her that we loved her at the time, and the same is true today,\" Gillibrand said in a statement Monday. \u00a0 Unlike several of her Senate colleagues running for president, Gillibrand has yet to receive a home-state endorsement. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the senior senator from New York, is remaining neutral because of the number of Democratic senators running for president. However, neither Gov. Andrew Cuomo or New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio have offered their support. Two members of the New York congressional delegation, Reps. Sean Patrick Maloney and Kathleen Rice, have endorsed O'Rourke. Gillibrand has made a name in the Senate for her fierce advocacy for victims of sexual assault in the military, and for her sharp criticism of Mr. Trump. The animosity between the New York senator and the president is mutual: Mr. Trump mentioned Gillibrand in a widely criticized tweet in 2017 claiming that used to come to his office \"begging\" for campaign donations and claimed she \"would do anything for them.\" Gillibrand called the tweet a \"sexist smear.\" Gillibrand announced her exploratory committee on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" in January. \"I'm going to run for president of the United States, because as a young mom, I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own,\" Gillibrand said on \"The Late Show,\" adding that she had the \"compassion, courage, and fearless determination\" to tackle issues such as institutional racism and corruption in Washington.

            "article_content": "Beto O'Rourke, the latest Democrat to join the presidential race, begins day two of his three-day tour through Iowa Friday morning. \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King met the former Texas congressman and Senate candidate as he finished his third stop in Iowa Thursday for his first TV interview since announcing his campaign. In their wide-ranging conversation, they discussed why he decided to run, his plans to tackle health care and why he thinks his limited government experience will not hurt his chances. O'Rourke lost his Senate race against Ted Cruz last year by a mere three points in a deep red state. In that process, he won fans nationwide, worrying other Democratic campaigns.  Asked why him and why now, he told King, \"This country has never faced a greater set of challenges.\"  \"For us to meet these challenges, including the greatest of them all, the existential crisis of climate change, we are all going to have to pull together. We're gonna have to fix this democracy and make it work for and represent everyone. The way in which I have served in El Paso on the city council or in the United States Congress, the way in which I campaigned all across Texas is all about bringing people together,\" O'Rourke said.  Criticism over O'Rourke's lack of experience was swift following his announcement on Thursday.  \"Three-term Congressman, no real legislation in his own name, lack of experience. I think even the Texas Tribune said, you know, 'paper thin record.' Why shouldn't voters be concerned about voting for you with your lack of experience?\" King asked.  \"Well, I'm grateful that ultimately it's up to voters and they'll have a chance to meet with me, question me, listen to me. And I'll have a chance to listen to them,\" he said. \"Lifelong El Pasoan with Amy raising these three amazing kids. Small business owner \u2026 serving in local government, being in the minority party for every one of the six years I was in Congress and yet delivering for the people I serve, delivering for veterans, delivering for our border community \u2026These were all things that we did by working with and listening to other people. And I'm convinced that it holds the key to our ability to meet even greater challenges before us. The only way we do this is by renewing and fixing our democracy and bringing everyone in.\" As a congressman, O'Rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, LGBT rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights. He also supports legislation to put DREAMers on a pathway to U.S. citizenship, and is a harsh critic of the Trump administration's immigration policies.  O'Rourke told King on healthcare, \"The goal should be universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care.\" \"I think we complement, supplement those who have private employer insurance with the ability to be covered under Medicare. That allows us sooner than almost any other plan to ensure every single American has the ability to see a doctor, afford their prescriptions, or take their child to a therapist,\" O'Rourke said.  Prominent 2020 candidates like Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders support eliminating private health insurance under a Medicare for All system, a plan that has provoked criticism from Republicans who have long accused Democrats of wanting to stage a government takeover of the health care system. \"I think Medicare For All is one of the possible paths,\" O'Rourke said. \"I think the fastest way to get there is to ensure that people who have insurance that they like through their employer are able to keep it, and that we complement that with those who can purchase Medicare, be covered by Medicaid.\" O'Rourke said he does plan to raise taxes on the wealthy and elaborated on what that would look like.  \"I think corporations should be asked to pay a greater share into the success of this country. I think the wealthiest at a time of historic income inequality should be asked to pay a greater share. I don't know what the levels should be at. But I know that the tax cuts from nearly two years ago of $2 trillion at a time that we had $21 trillion in debt, at a moment of extraordinary need across this country was one of the most irresponsible things that the country has ever done,\" O'Rourke said.  \"And you said if you are elected your cabinet will look like America,\" King said. \"What does that mean and why is that important to you?\"  \"In a country where the wealth is disproportionately concentrated in white families, in a country where the prison population, the largest on the face of the planet, is disproportionately black and brown, in a country that has never\u2014never fully accounted for the cost of slavery, of segregation, of suppression of voters, of participation in our economy, we have a lot of work to do,\" he said. \"And where we can ensure that those who have the opportunity to hold positions of power and public trust look like and reflect the country, we should make every effort to do so.\"  During his 2018 Senate campaign to unseat Ted Cruz, O'Rourke said he believed President Trump should be impeached. King asked him today, \"Do you still feel that way?\" \"It's beyond a shadow of a doubt to me that, if there was not collusion, there was at least the effort to collude with a foreign power, beyond the shadow of a doubt that if there was not obstruction of justice, there certainly was the effort to obstruct justice,\" O'Rourke replied. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied colluding with Russia to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. O'Rourke said Mr. Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey in 2017 and his tweeting to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation were potential examples of obstruction of justice. But he said the decision to impeach Mr. Trump was up to Congress, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said earlier this week that she opposes impeachment because it would be too divisive. O'Rourke now seems to believe there may be another way of removing the president. \"How Congress chooses to address those sets of facts and the findings which I believe we are soon to see from the Mueller report is up to them,\" O'Rourke told King. \"I think the American people are going to have a chance to decide this at the ballot box in November 2020, and perhaps that's the best way for us to resolve these outstanding questions.\"  ",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Top Democratic senators, including 2020 presidential candidates, are urging President Trump to support bipartisan legislation to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to certain Venezuelans living in the U.S..\u00a0 \"Granting TPS to Venezuela is a concrete measure your Administration can immediately take to alleviate the suffering of innocent Venezuelan civilians and to demonstrate our nation's commitment to supporting a safe democratic transition in Venezuela so that individuals can safely return home soon,\" a group of 24 senators, including presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar  and Cory Booker, wrote in a letter addressed to the president Thursday afternoon.\u00a0 Other lawmakers who signed the letter included Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois and Marco Rubio of Florida, the sole Republican in the group. \u00a0 If enacted, the legislation, which has been introduced in both the House and the Senate, would allow Venezuelans living in the U.S. who have fled the country's repressive government and collapsing economy to qualify for TPS protections and work permits. Although the Trump administration has sought to terminate TPS programs for immigrants from several countries in Latin America and Africa, some lawmakers are hoping the White House will support the bipartisan proposal for Venezuelans because of its tough stance against the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\u00a0 Departing from his more isolationist foreign policy approach, Mr. Trump has employed aggressive rhetoric to denounce Maduro's government, and his administration has undertaken concerted efforts to isolate the increasingly authoritarian leftist leader. Along with being the first nation to recognize National Assembly President Juan Guaid\u00f3   as Venezuela's interim president, the U.S. has pledged $20 million in humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan people. The administration has also imposed sweeping sanctions against Venezuelan government officials and the country's state-owned oil company.\u00a0 But it's unclear whether the president will support granting TPS designation to Venezuela since he has been adamant about ending programs for other countries. Extending legal status to a new group of immigrants will likely anger immigration hardliners in his base.\u00a0 The State Department, which has largely taken the lead on the U.S. strategy towards Venezuela, did not respond to CBS News' inquiry on whether the administration supports the legislation.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee entered the crowded race for the Democratic presidential nomination on Friday, hopeful that his focus on sweeping efforts to mitigate climate change will resonate with voters and draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of President Trump. He made his official announcement on the same day, with a rally at a solar plant in Seattle, with a speech focused on climate change and a promise to make it the country's \"number-one priority.\" \"We know that fighting climate change can't be somewhere down, long down the page on a laundry list of our national things to do,\" Inslee said. \"It requires building national mandate for bold and audacious action right now.\"\u00a0 \"I will put this simply,\" he went on to say. \"If climate change isn't priority number one it's not going to get done, so I am saying this. I am pledging today if I am given this high honor, I will make fighting climate change the number-one priority of the United States of America.\" The popular two-term governor announced his White House bid with a campaign video\u00a0published Friday morning that calls on Americans to join him in an endeavor to tackle \"the most urgent challenge of our time.\" \"This crisis isn't just a chart or graph anymore. The impacts are being felt everywhere,\" Inslee, 68, said in the video. \"We have an opportunity to transform our economy, run on 100 percent clean energy, that will bring millions of good paying jobs to every community across America, and create a more just future for everyone.\" \"I'm running for president because I am the only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation's number one priority,\" he added.\u00a0 Inslee, the first governor to launch a campaign for the White House this campaign cycle, joins one the most diverse and open Democratic primary fields in U.S. history. Nearly a dozen Democrats have declared their candidacy for president or launched presidential exploratory committees, including Sens.\u00a0Bernie Sanders,\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand,\u00a0Kamala Harris,\u00a0Cory Booker\u00a0and\u00a0Elizabeth Warren; Hawaii Rep.\u00a0Tulsi Gabbard; and former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro.\u00a0 Several others, like Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, are also considering bids for the Democratic nomination. With most 2020 Democrats throwing their support for the bold \"Green New Deal\" proposal introduced in early February by progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Inslee's spirited messaging on climate change has the potential to gain traction among Democratic primary voters and even prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue more during the nomination process. On the campaign trail, the Washington governor is likely to distinguish his support for federal action to reduce greenhouse gases and foster green energy jobs with the White House's controversial environmental decisions that have angered climate activists and scientists, including the abrupt withdrawal from the landmark Paris climate accords, the deregulation of the fossil fuel industry and the roll back of President Obama's \"Clean Power Plan\" initiatives.\u00a0 Inslee is also expected continue rebuking Mr.Trump for deriding human-induced climate change and calling it a \"hoax,\" despite scientists\u00a0repeatedly rebuffing him\u00a0for downplaying the assessment by the scientific community that the planet's\u00a0changing climate\u00a0is causing irreparable environmental damage. During his second term, the Washington governor has been a frequent and vocal critic of the president, appearing on cable news to denounce Mr. Trump's governance style and teaming up with the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, to mount court challenges to some of his administration's policies, including the travel ban designed to bar immigration from predominantly Muslim countries. In addition to climate change, Inslee will likely campaign on his advocacy for gun control measures, the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called \"the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages\" in the country.  But Inslee faces an uphill battle in expanding his name recognition across the country in a race that features high-profile senators and could also include the former vice president. Before defeating the incumbent Republican attorney general to win Washington's governorship in 2012, Inslee served in Congress for an interrupted tenure of nearly 15 years. As the Representative for Washington's 1st Congressional district, he strongly opposed the war in Iraq and was one of the first lawmakers to call on the federal government to undertake sweeping policies to transform the American economy by ending its dependence on fossil fuels and investing heavily in renewable energy like solar and wind. Inslee was born and raised in Seattle. Ben Mitchell contributed to this report. Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts\u00a0that aired Sunday, Feb. 24, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to turn now to a Massachusetts Democrat, Senator Ed Markey, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee responsible for U.S. policy on North Korea. But before we get there, I'd like you to weigh in on this. This declaration of a national emergency. Is Congress powerless to stop the president? SENATOR ED MARKEY: It's a clear usurpation of congressional authority. There will be a resolution of disapproval which most likely will pass in the House of Representatives this week. Then it will come over to the United States Senate. It's uncertain whether there are enough-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president say he's going to veto it. SEN. MARKEY: -- and then even if there are a small handful of Republicans who are willing to vote for that resolution of disapproval, the president says that he's going to veto it and then it will come back to the House and Senate, and I believe it's highly unlikely that there will be two thirds of the House and Senate who will vote that way given the base support of the Republican Party for President Trump and his actions. And then it will go to the courts. And I think in the courts we're going to have a very strong case that this is an unconstitutional action by the president in usurping an authority which was deliberately built into the Constitution, by the Founding Fathers to ensure that there was a separation of powers, that there was a check and balance on a president so that they could not act unilaterally. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is the bigger point I think for- for viewers to understand that this seems all procedural bureaucratic talk in Washington but that bigger purpose of how our government is supposed to function and how it is, is the question here. In the past under President Obama you were supportive of his use of executive authority on a number of different fronts including immigration. Do you regret that now, and why is it different what President Trump is- how he's using it? SEN. MARKEY: The clear difference here is that the Congress, House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans, just reached an agreement on funding for border security. They just finished it and they sent it to the president. A president cannot use his executive authority- his emergency authority when none exists- when Congress just finished acting on it when they provided money for the president to provide additional security along the border. So no, this is- this is a new area that the president- which President Trump has now entered. It's not Hurricane Katrina. It's not after 9/11. This is something quite substantial which would have precedential value when a Democrat is president. And I think Republicans should be very, very cautious in allowing for President Trump to take this authority because it would lead to a very significant diminution of the authority of the Congress in the future when any president, Democrat or Republican, seek to act. MARGARET BRENNAN: North Korea. As we said, you watch Asia policy very carefully. Here, a number of leading national security minded Democrats have released a letter saying that the administration is just not sharing information at all on the diplomacy under way. What are your thoughts on that? What do you need to know? SEN. MARKEY: Well right now, it's pretty clear that Kim wants to have a personal meeting with Trump with hopes that he can, in fact, elicit concessions from President Trump that otherwise might not be possible if it was just our diplomats talking one on one. So I think there is apprehension, in fact amongst President Trump's own diplomats heading into this summit. Nothing is clear and I think as a result we could run the risk that- Kim is given concessions which are not accompanied by real concessions that the United States is receiving in return from Kim and his regime. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying the president's going to get played. SEN. MARKEY: I think that he has to be very careful going in. He has to make sure-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically what does that mean? What is Congress most concerned about? Is it troops on the peninsula? \u00a0The president has said he's not looking to withdraw them. SEN. BLUNT: Well he's looking for a declaration to the end of the Korean War. He's looking for other concessions. But I think that in order to be sure that this summit is in fact successful, the President should first return with a codification of the freezing of the missile program and a nuclear program in North Korea. That testing should not continue. Second, that there should be a verifiable program of inspection of the entire nuclear program in North Korea. And third, that there should be a roadmap which is put in place to ensure that no concessions made by the United States, for example, in lifting of sanctions occurs without verifiable evidence that Kim is complying step by step with the denuclearization of North Korea. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, is- is there a risk to Democrats weaponizing the Mueller report as Bannon accused Democrats of doing? SEN. MARKEY: The Democrats have a responsibility to make sure that there was not a compromise of the presidential election of 2016. If the attorney general takes the Mueller report and then sanitizes it and releases that as the answer to a comprehensive investigation, then I think the Democrats in the House and Senate, along with Republicans, have a responsibility to ensure that the American people know what happened in 2016. What was the relationship between the Trump campaign and the Russian government? Was there any subsequent relationship in the post-election period? We don't know the answers to those questions. The Mueller report potentially gives us those answers and it's going to be critical that the American public knows what happened in 2016. Right now everything rides on that Mueller Report and the Attorney General William Barr not sanitizing it in a way that is not transparent to the public and the Congress. The Democrats have a responsibility to do that job. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Markey, thank you very much.",

Mr. Trump made the comments in a meeting with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz at the White House Wednesday. \"That'll be totally up to the new attorney general, he's a tremendous man a tremendous person who really respects this country and respects the Justice Department so that'll be totally up to him,\" Mr. Trump said, asked about the timing of the release of Mueller's report after CNN posted a report claiming Mueller's investigation is drawing to a close.\u00a0 Asked if the special counsel's report should be released in full, the president added that from what he understands, \"that'll be totally up to the attorney general.\" Sources tell CBS News that report detailing the findings of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, is expected to be delivered to the Justice Department before Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein departs in March. He has overseen the investigation since it began. Mr. Trump has said before that he'd leave the handling of Mueller's report is up to Barr.

            "article_content": "One year after 17 people were killed in a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, most Americans on all sides of the issue say they are frustrated by the national debate over guns and gun policy.  As they have for a few years now, a majority of Americans want gun laws to be made more strict, but they don't expect Washington to make significant changes to gun policy.  After the Parkland shooting, students and others organized marches to draw attention to the issue. At the time, a CBS News poll found that 58 percent of Americans who supported stricter gun laws felt the marches marked a turning point in the effort to enact stricter gun laws. A year later, most stricter gun law proponents feel frustrated.\u00a0  Looking forward, most don't expect any significant changes to gun laws over the next year. Both opponents and supporters of stricter gun laws feel this way. Three in four Americans don't think it's likely that President Trump and Congress will pass any laws that will make significant changes to gun policy \u2013 an outlook that both gun control supporters and opponents as well as partisans of both sides share.  It was the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut that marked somewhat of a turning point in the public's views on gun laws. The percentage backing stricter gun laws spiked in CBS News polling, jumping 11 points after that shooting from the year before. CBS News polling shows more than half of Americans have consistently backed stricter laws since 2014, regardless of whether the measure was taken after a high-profile shooting, or not.\u00a0 Overall, 56 percent of Americans want laws covering the sale of guns to be made more strict. As has been the case for years, views divide along partisan lines. Most Democrats and a slim majority of independents want stricter laws, while most Republicans either want laws to stay as they are or be made less strict. In looking at specific measures regarding gun policy, they meet with varying levels of support and opposition. There has long been strong majority support for universal or enhanced background checks for all gun buyers. In CBS News polling conducted just after the Parkland shooting, a large majority of Americans (87 percent) favored more money for mental health screening. Both of these measures found favor across party lines. Views have been somewhat more divided on items like banning assault weapons or AR-15 semi-automatics \u2013 the weapon used in the Parkland attack. Soon after that shooting, 53 percent favored a nationwide ban on the AR-15, though most Republicans opposed it.  One proposal that was debated extensively in the wake of the Parkland shooting was whether more teachers and school officials should carry guns in school. This was not supported by most Americans (44 percent favored it) but it was favored by a majority of Republicans.  In a CBS News Poll taken just weeks after the Parkland attack, more Americans felt arming teachers would lead to more violence (44 percent) than prevent it (29 percent). About a quarter thought it wouldn't have an impact.  While a majority of Americans have supported stricter gun laws in recent years, it is often not a top election issue for most voters. Six in 10 voters who went to the polls in 2018 favored stricter gun control measures, according to CBS News national exit polling. But when voters were asked to choose from a list of four issues as the most important facing the country, gun policy was outranked by health care, immigration and the economy. Just one in 10 voters said it was their top concern.\u00a0 Gun policy was not a top priority for gun control opponents either. After the Parkland shooting, students rallied around the issue of gun policy, holding a number of high-profile marches and demonstrations across the country. Young people who voted in the midterms favored stricter gun laws in higher numbers than older voters, but CBS News exit polls found it was not the top issue of the choices offered, ranking behind health care and the economy. Gun policy ranked last as the most important issue among voters ages 18 to 29, as it did for voters overall.\u00a0 Toplines:",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi behind and above. Female immigrants, gazing down from the balcony. A black woman who ran a close race for governor of Georgia, rebutting. When President Trump delivers his first State of the Union address under divided government on Tuesday, he'll be surrounded by these and other living reminders of the 2018 elections that delivered Democrats the House majority and a record number of women to Congress. Pelosi will sit just over his shoulder on the dais, on-camera, looking out at the assembled lawmakers, Cabinet members, Supreme Court justices and diplomats. Seated in front of Mr. Trump will be a record number of women House members, most Democrats and some dressed in easy-to-spot white. And in the gallery overhead? Two former employees of Mr. Trump's New Jersey golf club, women and immigrants, who have spoken out about its hiring practices. Afterward, Stacey Abrams will become the first black woman to deliver the Democratic rebuttal. \"I hope she does a good job. I respect her,\" the president said Thursday of Abrams, who narrowly lost the race for Georgia governor to the president's ally, Brian Kemp. The president pledged to deliver a speech rooted in a theme of \"unity,\" even as he renewed his demand for a border wall as a condition of keeping the government open past Feb. 15. Before he spoke in the Oval Office Thursday, Pelosi again rebuffed the demand and belittled him on national security matters. Mr. Trump will give his speech Tuesday before a joint session of Congress at a sensitive time in talks to prevent agencies from shuttering after the longest government shutdown in history. Democratic members of Congress are inviting federal workers who went without pay for 35 days and are worried about a repeat. But the striking visual is shaping up to be the new lawmakers who will be arrayed around the president and elected in the wake of Trump's inflammatory statements about women, immigrants, Muslims and more. Two female immigrants will be among the lawmakers' guests and seated in the gallery above the House chamber. One is Victorina Morales, who worked for one of Mr. Trump's clubs in New Jersey for years even though she was born in Guatemala and lived in the U.S. illegally. Morales, a guest of New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, said in an interview that she feels respectful toward the president. But she does have a message for him after years of hearing Mr. Trump describe immigrants as a scourge that takes jobs from Americans. \"Forget about the wall, stop separating families and focus on immigration reform,\" she said in an interview with The Associated Press, conducted in Spanish. Another woman who cleaned the president's clothes and made his bed at his Bedminster, N.J., club is attending the address, too. Sandra Diaz, 46, a native of Costa Rica who worked at Trump's club from 2010 to 2013, will be attending as a guest of Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California, according to the lawyer for both women, Anibal Romero. Diaz told the AP last month that she was also hired without legal papers and supervisors at the club knew it. She is now a legal permanent U.S. resident. Diaz said she decided to speak out because she is angry about the president describing immigrants as violent. Abrams said she'll speak about inclusion \"at a moment when our nation needs to hear from leaders who can unite for a common purpose.\" ___ Associated Press writers Luis Alonso Lugo in Washington, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 While there are\u00a0significant rifts between the White House and Democratic congressional leaders on issues such as government funding, border security and immigration, the Trump administration's crackdown on President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government in Venezuela has garnered rare bipartisan support from lawmakers.\u00a0 \"There are always going to be issues on which we agree,\" freshman Democratic Congresswoman Donna Shalala, of Florida, told CBS News. \"And for those of us that have large Venezuelan populations and who care about the future of Latin American democracy, this is an issue on which we can join together.\" Shalala, who served as Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under President Clinton, represents a majority-Latino district in south Florida with a sizable community of Venezuelan exiles. Along with a growing number of rank-and-file members of her caucus, the 77-year-old Democrat has enthusiastically backed the White House's recent aggressive measures to isolate Maduro's increasingly authoritarian government.\u00a0 Many Democratic lawmakers, including Shalala, have joined their Republican colleagues in praising the administration for\u00a0recognizing National Assembly President Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's interim president, issuing\u00a0sweeping sanctions against the largest state-owned oil company in the South American nation and offering\u00a0$20 million in humanitarian aid\u00a0to the people of Venezuela.\u00a0 \"We have common interests,\" another Florida congressman, Rep. Darren Soto, told CBS News. The two-term Democrat said both parties back sanctions against Maduro's regime, the recognition of Venezuela's opposition leaders and humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 \"We all stand against tyranny \u2014 and this is an attack on democracy,\" he said.\u00a0 Soto and Shalala have teamed up with lawmakers of both parties to introduce several bills to address the worsening political and socioeconomic crisis in Venezuela. One bill would codify existing restrictions on U.S. arms sales to Maduro's government and add tear gas and batons to the list of banned items. Another proposal would allow the U.S. government to dispatch $150 million in humanitarian aid to Venezuela. And a third would allow Venezuelans living in the U.S. who have fled the country's repressive government and collapsing economy to qualify for Temporary Protected Status (TPS).\u00a0 Although not all Democrats have been as publicly supportive of the White House's efforts in Venezuela as members of the Florida delegation, only a few of the most progressive members of Congress have explicitly rebuked the president's strategy. Some Democrats, most notably Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, have expressed concerns about the U.S. meddling in a foreign political dispute and imposing crippling sanctions that could harm a Venezuelan population already grappling with widespread food and medicine shortages.\u00a0 \"With respect Senator Durbin, the US should not anoint the leader of the opposition in Venezuela during an internal, polarized conflict,\" Khanna wrote on Twitter after Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-highest ranking Democrat in the Senate, released a statement voicing his support for the president's recognition of Guaid\u00f3.\u00a0 Omar, one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress, even accused the Trump administration of sponsoring a coup. \"If we really want to support the Venezuelan people, we can lift the economic sanctions that are inflicting suffering on innocent families, making it harder for them to access food and medicines, and deepening the economic crisis,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"We should support dialogue, not a coup!\" In another tweet, Omar said, \"The U.S. has a history of disastrous interventions in Latin America.\" In its crusade against communism during the Cold War, the U.S. supported various violent coups in Latin America, including some against democratically-elected governments. But Shalala believes most members of her party do not share Khanna's and Omar's views on Venezuela.\u00a0 \"That's their opinion,\" she said. \"You just named two people. Name 100. I'll name 100 that are supportive of the efforts to restore democracy in Venezuela, who also believe its appropriate for us to protect the Venezuelan people from the security forces.\"\u00a0 Shalala said she understands why some lawmakers are hesitant to back efforts designed to facilitate the ouster of a foreign government, given America's history of assisting right-wing leaders who violently overthrew governments and installed authoritarian regimes. But she stressed that this time was different because America's efforts are supported by an international coalition, including most of Latin America and the Organization of American States (OAS).\u00a0 Guaid\u00f3's declaration last week set off a new wave of violence and chaos in oil-rich Venezuela \u2014 once considered one of Latin America's wealthiest countries. The 35-year-old opposition leader, who's already been targeted by the Maduro-allied Supreme Court, is betting on pressure from the international community and military defections to oust Maduro. But so far, top military leaders in Venezuela have remained loyal to the ruling government. Guaid\u00f3 has called for peaceful, nationwide demonstrations on Saturday to force Maduro to hold elections.\u00a0 Shalala urged the Trump administration to continue to assist the opposition, which she said is supported by the \"majority of the people.\" On Friday, Vice President Michael Pence will travel to Miami to meet with the exiled Venezuelan community in the area, along with a congressional delegation. \u00a0 \"Our hopes and prayers\u00ad \u2014 and our muscle, I hope \u2014 is with the Venezuelan people,\" Shalala said.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris kicked off her campaign for the presidency on Sunday with an energetic rally of thousands of supporters in her hometown of Oakland, California, framing her candidacy as an effort to restore fundamental American values she believes are under attack. \"We are at an inflection point in the history of our world. We are at an inflection point in the history of our nation. We are here because the American dream and our American democracy are under attack and on the line like never before,\" Harris said. \"We are here at this moment in time because we must answer a fundamental question: Who are we? ... Who are we as Americans?\" She declared that \"under this administration, America's position in the world has never been weaker\" with \"foreign powers infecting the White House like malware.\" The 54-year-old freshman lawmaker\u00a0announced her bid\u00a0for the Democratic nomination last week, becoming the fourth female candidate to wade into the already-crowded race. An estimated 20,000 people crowded a plaza in front of Oakland City Hall, filing in shortly before 1 p.m. local time as musical acts performed and a young girl recited the pledge of allegiance. A pastor delivered an impassioned invocation before Harris was introduced by Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland. Harris took the stage to the tune of Mary J. Blige at about 1:40 p.m., greeted by loud applause from the assembled supporters, many of whom waved signs emblazoned with her campaign slogan, \"For the People.\" The former California attorney general said she was \"so proud to be a daughter of Oakland, California,\" noting she was born at a nearby hospital. She never mentioned President Trump by name, but vowed to challenge him directly, highlighting her work as a prosecutor to argue against the administration's immigration policies. \"Folks, on the subject of transnational gangs, let's be perfectly clear: The president's medieval vanity project is not going to stop them,\" Harris said, presumably referring to Mr. Trump's proposed border wall. \"When we have children in cages, crying for their mothers and fathers, don't you dare call that border security,\" she added later. \"That's a human rights abuse.\"\u00a0 The Republican National Committee was quick to return fire, with a spokesman saying Harris' \"liberal policies are totally out-of-step with most Americans.\" After graduating from law school in 1989, Harris returned to Oakland and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office. In 2003, she defeated a two-term incumbent to become San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. Harris announced her presidential run last Monday on Martin Luther King Jr. Day after telegraphing her intentions for months. Elected to the Senate in 2016, Harris has used her perch on the powerful Judiciary Committee to quickly elevate her profile. She has laid out a plan to provide middle-class families with tax credits worth thousands of dollars. She wrote a new book published in early January laying out her life story and career as a prosecutor. \u00a0 The daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, Harris' campaign logo and promotional materials evoked the style used in the 1972 campaign of Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to run for the nomination of a major party. Harris' campaign will have its headquarters in Baltimore, with a second location in Oakland. Watch Harris' full remarks in the video below: Sean Gallitz contributed reporting from Oakland.",

            "article_content": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz left his company seven months ago which led many to wonder what the socially conscious executive was planning. To Schultz, Starbucks was never just a coffee shop. He saw his stores as meeting halls where customers came to chew over the great issues of the day. His activism is rooted in a rags-to-riches life. And tonight, Schultz reveals traumas he has never discussed publicly. At the age of 65, he is preparing for the greatest challenge of his life. Many believe that Schultz would run for president as a Democrat. His announcement tonight may come as a surprise. Howard Schultz:\u00a0I am seriously thinking of running for president. I will run as a centrist independent, outside of the two-party system we're living at a most-fragile time not only the fact that this president is not qualified to be the president, but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what's necessary on behalf of the American people and are engaged, every single day, in revenge politics. Scott Pelley: Why run as an Independent? Your views have always aligned with the Democratic Party. Howard Schultz: That's true. I've, you know, I've been a lifelong Democrat. I look at both parties-- we see extremes on both sides well, we are sitting, today, with approximately $21.5 trillion of debt, which is a reckless example, not only of Republicans, but of Democrats, as well, as a reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility.  Scott Pelley: Do you worry that you're going to siphon votes away from the Democrats and, thereby, ensure that President Trump has a second term? Howard Schultz: I wanna see the American people win. I wanna see America win. I don't care if you're a Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas. And I will be an independent person, who will embrace those ideas. Because I am not, in any way, in bed with a party. \u00a0 We met with Howard Schultz this month in his adopted hometown of Seattle. It was here, in 1981 that he arrived as a stranger in the Pike Place Market to visit the original Starbucks, just a tiny store that sold coffee beans. Scott Pelley: You were selling coffee makers, living in New York, and this was one of your customers. Why did you come out here to visit them? Howard Schultz: The thing is, I had never heard of Starbucks. And they were buying a ton of these products. And I just thought I gotta come to Seattle and see who this company was.  How he created the phenomenon we know is a story longer than the line at Starbucks. Suffice to say Schultz got a job behind this counter. He installed an espresso machine. And in 1987, with borrowed money, he bought the shop. Scott Pelley: How many stores are there today? Howard Schultz: Almost 30,000 in 77 countries. A sweet success with a few bitter notes. Starbucks almost went broke in the 2007 financial crisis.  And last year, a store manager set off a furor when she called police on African-American men who were just hanging out at a table. Schultz closed all the U.S. stores for hours of racial bias training. Race had been an issue even before, when Schultz asked employees to talk to customers about racial justice. Howard Schultz: We had a moral obligation as a company to discuss this. Scott Pelley: And, then, you were excoriated for having a coffee shop tell people what it thinks about humanity. Howard Schultz: The execution was flawed. And who owns that execution? I do because I was the one who was pushing us to not play it safe.  But from the beginning his 350,000 employees caught a break with Schultz's social agenda. \u00a0 They enjoy health insurance, tuition aid and stock.  Schultz likes to say he created the company his impoverished parents never had the chance to work for.  Howard Schultz: When I read statistics that says that over 40 percent of the American people don't have $400 in the bank and only a crisis away from bankruptcy, or that five and a half million kids in America, many of whom are African American and Latino, are not in school and not in work and don't have a chance, and one out of six people in America are food insecure, this is what I think about. Those grim numbers describe his own childhood.  Howard Schultz: This place has never left me. I think it has defined my character, my vulnerability \u00a0 Schultz took us back in time to his boyhood home, Scott Pelley: And this is the way up to the seventh floor. A Brooklyn, New York, public housing project. His family was already poor when his father was injured on the job. With no insurance, they were destitute. And bitterness led to violence. Scott Pelley: Your father beat you-- with his fists. Howard Schultz: There were moments where there was physical abuse, yes. Scott Pelley: He beat you up, when you were taking a shower. And you ended up crumpled on the floor of the shower, watching your blood go down the drain. At that moment, you thought what? Howard Schultz: I was 15. I was disrespectful to my mother. He came home and-- beat me to a pulp. I couldn't go to school for a couple days. I was angry, upset. Scott Pelley: Did you hate him? Howard Schultz: I'm sure there were moments when I did. And then there were glorious moments of being in the right-field bleachers at Yankee Stadium with him. There is a level of hate that does emerge. But it didn't stay.  His journey is mapped in a new autobiography titled \"From the Ground Up.\" Scott Pelley: If your father was the darkness, your mother was the light. Howard Schultz: She was. And my self-esteem came from my mother. And I could say that if-- if my mother was here, if my mother-- for her, it would just be the greatest moment of her life, to think. Because one of the things that is, has been so hard for me is that both my parents didn't-- did not see my success at Starbucks. maybe I'm here because of her. Scott Pelley: Well, let me see if I can find out where you are on some of the issues that are pressing in the country. Immigration. Howard Schultz: The country first and foremost is based on humanity, fairness, goodness, we have been for 200-plus years a country of immigrants. And for the 11 million people here unauthorized, there should be a fair and equitable way for them to get in line, pay the taxes, pay a fee, and become citizens of the United States. Scott Pelley: Climate change. Howard Schultz: Tremendous mistake, again, by President Trump, to leave the Paris Climate Accord.  Scott Pelley: Health care. Scott Pelley: Every American deserves the right to have access to quality health care. But what the Democrats are proposing is something that is as false as the wall. And that is free health care for all, which the country cannot afford.  Scott Pelley: The 2018 tax cut. Howard Schultz: I would not have given a free ride to business, from 35 percent or 37 percent to 21 percent. It would've been more modest. But I would've significantly addressed the people who need tax relief the most, which is the people I talked about earlier, who don't have $400 in the bank. Scott Pelley: Many people are going to ask what does the coffee entrepreneur know about being commander in chief? Howard Schultz: I have a long history of recognizing, I'm not the smartest person in the room, that in order to make great decisions about complex problems, I have to recruit and attract people who are smarter than me and more experienced, more skilled, and we've got to create an understanding that we need a creative debate in the room to make these kind of decisions. His world view is shaped by his experience as a global CEO. Howard Schultz: Is it in our national interest to have a fight with Mexico, Canada, the EU, China, NATO? Is it in our interest? Give me a break. No, it's not in our interest. These are our friends. These are our allies. We are much better, as a country, being part of the world order.  Schultz formed his alliance with his wife Sheri when they were married more than 36 years ago. Today, they have a son and a daughter, two grandchildren and another on the way. Sheri schultz oversees the family's $200 million charity that links disadvantaged youth and veterans to jobs.  Scott Pelley: This is a long, rocky road, running for president. Is this something you wanna do? Sheri Schultz: Well, it, it wasn't in my plan, my long-term life plan for sure.  Scott Pelley: Did he tell you or did he ask you? Sheri Schultz: No, he asked. He came to the family. We knew it was serious-- Howard Schultz: I'm still-- I'm still asking. Sheri Schultz: He's still asking and many family meetings. He's still asking himself whether to run. But he has assembled a campaign team and he's done the homework. Scott Pelley: Can you get on the ballot in all 50 states? Howard Schultz: If I decide to run for president, not only will I be on the ballot of every state, all 50 states, but we'll be on the ballot in every county, in every district, that we have done that work.  Scott Pelley: Would the stores be part of this? Is there going to be a Schultz 2020 button on every green apron across the country? Howard Schultz: Uh, no there would be a complete separation between me and the company. Scott Pelley: What we know is that no independent has ever come close to winning. Howard Schultz: What we know, factually, is that over 40 percent of the electorate is either a registered Independent or currently affiliates themselves as an Independent. Because the American people are exhausted. Their trust has been broken. And they are looking for a better choice. Scott Pelley: What effect do you think being Jewish would have on your campaign?  Howard Schultz: I have great faith in the goodness and kindness of the American people. We elected an African-American president. I'm old enough to remember in 1960 when John F. Kennedy was running and there was an outcry of hate that no one Catholic should be president. I am Jewish, I have faith in God. I am not running as a Jew if I decide to run for president I'm running as an American who happens to be Jewish. Scott Pelley: Your net worth is something close to $3.5 billion and Forbes magazine would tell you that that's more money than Donald Trump has. Are you willing to spend what it takes to win? Howard Schultz: Well, I'll say it this way we'll be fully resourced to do what's necessary.  Scott Pelley: Winning could cost $300 million, $500 million. Do those numbers change your mind? Howard Schultz: No.  Scott Pelley: Would you release your tax returns? Howard Schultz: 100 percent. Yes. Scott Pelley: Well, Donald Trump said that. Howard Schultz: I will. We can do it today, if you want Scott.  Decades ago, housewares salesman Howard Schultz fell for the traditions of Seattle's Pike Place Market. Some traditions slimier than others. Now he's challenging tradition, asking whether Americans want to toss old politics into fresh hands.  Scott Pelley: You know it's 'on' after this interview. President Trump is gonna be tweeting by about 8:00 Eastern Time.  Howard Schultz: You know, I'm \u2013  Scott Pelley: Gonna say terrible things about you. Howard Schultz: I think, like most people, I'm, I've become bored with President Trump and his tweets. Produced by Ashley Velie. Associate producer, Dina Zingaro. Correspondent, \"60 Minutes\"",

            "article_content": "Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana slammed an explosive BuzzFeed News report about alleged evidence President Trump directed his former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress, calling the story \"embarrassing.\"\u00a0 \"What happened with respect to the BuzzFeed article \u2014 it was embarrassing. I think the First Amendment was bruised. Look, reporters make mistakes. We all do,\" Kennedy said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\u00a0 \"What surprised me was not that somebody made a mistake, intentional or not, but it ... was astonishing to me that so many folks didn't stop and say, 'Hey, you know, let's think about this. Could this be true? Who are the sources? Had these particular reporters had problems before?'\" Kennedy added. \"It was almost as if it was some of the reporting was not reporting. It was wishful thinking, and I think that hurts the First Amendment.\"\u00a0 Late Thursday, BuzzFeed News published the story reporting the special counsel Robert Mueller's office had evidence Mr. Trump instructed Cohen to lie to congressional investigators about his role in negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The bombshell report raised the possibility the president could be implicated in a federal crime and prompted Democrats to call for investigations and, in some cases, impeachment proceedings if the report was accurate. \"If the Buzzfeed story is true, President Trump must resign or be impeached,\" Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas wrote on Twitter.\u00a0 But in a rare public statement, Mueller's office disputed BuzzFeed News' reporting. \"BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the special counsel's office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony are not accurate,\" Peter Carr, the special counsel's spokesman, wrote in a statement nearly 24 hours after the story was published. BuzzFeed News has said it stands by its reporting. The president and his supporters have seized on Mueller's statement to bash the press for alleged bias and unfair coverage. \"Many people are saying that the Mainstream Media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years (including the election lead-up), as highlighted by the disgraceful BuzzFeed story & the even more disgraceful coverage!\" Mr. Trump\u00a0tweeted\u00a0Saturday. The day before, Mr. Trump proclaimed, \"Fake News is truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!\" Kennedy said he hopes William Barr, the president's nominee for attorney general, will release Mueller's final report if he is confirmed to lead the Justice Department. And if there's a regulation that prevents Barr from doing so, Kennedy said the attorney general nominee should consider waiving it. \"I think they ought to release Mueller's report for a couple of reasons. Number one, it's going to leak anyway. Washington D.C. leaks like the Titanic. And number two, I think the American people have a right to know,\" he said. During confirmation hearings last week, Barr declined to commit to releasing any eventual report in full. Asked about Mr. Trump's immigration offer to Democrats to try to end the longest government shutdown in U.S history, Kennedy said the White House's proposal is not perfect, but \"represents progress.\" He added that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's opposition to the offer was \"predictable\" but said more centrist Democrats are \"glad the president put something on the table.\" Any measure to reopen the government that does not include funding for a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border will surely be rejected by the White House, Kennedy added.\u00a0 \"I talked to the president about this issue for about an hour last week,\" he said. \"And if you bring a plan to him that doesn't include a wall, it's dead as four o'clock.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

The kin of the U.S. attorney general nominee stole the show Tuesday, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle unable to stop commenting about him during the hours of hearings. Liam also wrote a note of encouragement to his grandfather \u2014 and even slipped in some foreign policy analysis. Barr introduced his grandson at the hearing by joking that he's a future Justice Department employee. That opened the door for senators to start offering career advice. I had a great conversation with Liam this morning. I\u2019m looking forward to getting to know his grandfather, William Barr, during the Attorney General hearing today. pic.twitter.com/Czq75hhace \"Think about medical school, Liam. Somebody needs to make money in the family,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, suggested a different path, since several members of Barr's family have already gone through Justice: \"He ought to consider, at least for some balance, being a public defender.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, commended Liam for taking notes as he sat in the front row of the audience. Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, tweeted a photo of him holding court with the boy. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, sent a \"care package\" of snacks to Liam, and said he \"deserves a medal\" for sitting through the hours of questioning. .@SenFeinstein sends \"a little care package\" to William Barr's grandson. pic.twitter.com/ED0b8lJ0oP A photo captured one of the notes Liam wrote as his grandfather was grilled by the committee. \"Dear Grandpa, I love you so much You are doing great so fun ... I am having so much fun,\" it read. He added a P.S., apparently after hearing so much talk from lawmakers about Russian election inference: \"I think russia's people are fine It is the government is the problem.\" (CQ) If you have kids, you know these are the BEST photos of the month.

            "article_content": "Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under former President Obama, announced Saturday he is running for president in 2020. Castro, who is Mexican-American, made the announcement in San Antonio, his hometown and the city where he served as mayor for five years. He spoke in Plaza Guadalupe, an outdoor venue in the city across from Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church.\u00a0 \"I'm running for president because it's time for new leadership, it's time for new energy, it's time for new commitment to make sure the opportunities that I had are available to every American,\" Castro said.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"When my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago, I'm sure she never could have imagined that just two generations later, one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the United States Congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words: I am a candidate for President of the United States of America,\" he said in both English and Spanish. \"There are no frontrunners that are born here, but I've always believed that with big dreams and hard work, anything is possible in this country,\" Castro said about his hometown. His slogan is \"One Nation. One Destiny.\" Castro explained that the \"destiny\" was \"to be the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest, and the most prosperous nation on earth.\" He mentioned several issues in his speech, including health care and criminal justice reform, as well as reiterating his support for \"Black Lives Matter.\" Immigration reform was also a key topic. He mentioned President Trump's visit to McAllen, Texas, this week, and denounced Mr. Trump's characterization of a \"crisis\" at the border. \"There is a crisis today. It's a crisis of leadership. Donald Trump has failed to uphold the values of our great nation,\" Castro said. He also said that as president, his first executive order would be recommitting to the Paris Climate Agreement, which Mr. Trump pulled out of after taking office. He ended his speech by saying, \"Let's go work! Vamonos!\" \u00a0 Several people spoke before Castro, including his twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who joked that he would grow a beard to differentiate himself from his brother. The speakers each discussed their excitement about Castro launching a presidential campaign. He was introduced by his mother. \"I want to be honest with you: There are going to be a lot of great candidates in this race,\" Joaquin Castro said, adding that he wished them all well, \"but I know we have the best candidate with the best ideas and the biggest heart.\" Castro has spent the last two years as a guest lecturer at the University of Texas and other universities and recently published a memoir that was seen as his treatise for a potential campaign. He had passed on a 2018 campaign for U.S. Senate or governor in Texas, a sign he remained focused on\u00a0eventually launching a presidential campaign. When he formed a presidential exploratory committee in December, he told CBS News: \"People are ready to get on a better track with leadership that's focused on creating opportunity for everybody and trying to bring the country together, rather than tear us apart.\" \"I've had a chance over the last several years to get a sense of what people are looking for. I've visited more than 100 communities across the United States and I believe they're ready for new leadership,\" he said. \u00a0 In a field of candidates that could include dozens of current and former lawmakers, governors and mayors, Castro told CBS News last month that he would cite his \"track record of getting things done at the local and the federal level.\" \"There are going to be a lot of talented people running and I look forward to making my case to the voters,\" he said.\u00a0 Castro's twin brother, Joaquin, is poised to be a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee next year and to hold a senior position in his brother's campaign, likely in a fundraising role, given that both brothers have been popular draws on the county and state party fundraising circuit for several years.

            "article_content": "The White House said Thursday that they would declare a national emergency in order to fund a barrier along the southern border. But the move is almost certain to invite challenges.\u00a0 President Trump has long claimed that there is a \"crisis at the border\" due to the high number of people seeking to cross into the U.S. (though he does not differentiate between illegal immigrants and asylum seekers). And he has repeatedly threatened to bypass Congress and use emergency funds to build a wall, which was one of his core campaign promises during the 2016 election.\u00a0 Amid urging from some Congressional conservatives, the administration says it will move forward with an emergency declaration. \"The president is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday.\u00a0 Ironically, the National Emergencies Act of 1975 was intended to constrain the power of the presidency, to create a structure for the president to declare national emergencies in the post-Watergate era. Under that law, the president can declare a national emergency, but must outline the specific emergency powers he is using under existing statutes. So Mr. Trump would have to justify his actions using acts already passed by Congress. There are a few statutes which could allow the administration to use Pentagon money to build the wall, once he declares a national emergency. One would allow the secretary of Defense to \"undertake military construction projects\" which are \"necessary to support such use of the armed forces.\"  Another statute allows the Pentagon to \"apply the resources of the Department of the Army's civil works program,\" and to reprogram those resources \"to construct or assist in the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of authorized civil works, military construction, and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense.\" Despite its name, the Army Corps of Engineers is made up almost entirely of civilians who administer construction contracts, so troops wouldn't actually be building the wall. There are a couple of other smaller streams of money that would be available to the president, too, if he were to declare a national emergency. The defense secretary is permitted to undertake a military construction project if \"the project is vital to the national security,\" but only $50 million is allocated for that each year, far short of Mr. Trump's $5.7 billion request. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the president can declare an \"immigration emergency,\" which is defined as when an \"actual or imminent influx of aliens which either is of such magnitude or exhibits such other characteristics that effective administration of the immigration laws of the United States is beyond the existing capabilities.\" A state attorney general can request the president's response to an immigration emergency and detail what is needed to address it. However, only $20 million is available under that statute. Congress can cancel a national emergency, but it would require a rare amount of bipartisanship. Congress would have to approve a joint resolution disapproving the national emergency, which would easily pass the Democratic-controlled House but could face opposition in the Republican-majority Senate. If both houses pass the joint resolution, it would require the president's signature, and Mr. Trump would be unlikely to sign a bill which overturns his own declaration. Congress would then have to pass the joint resolution with a veto-proof majority, meaning that two-thirds of both houses would have to approve the bill. Some Congressional Republicans, such as Sens. John Cornyn and Susan Collins, have in recent weeks indicated that they do not support an emergency declaration.\u00a0 Some argue that legal precedent set by the 1953 Supreme Court case Youngstown v. Sawyer prevents the president from using this power. In that case, the court found that the attempted nationalization of steel mills by President Harry Truman using his commander-in-chief power was unconstitutional. \"The decision imposed fundamental constitutional limits on the president's power to claim that a national emergency \u2014 in this case, the Korean War \u2014 allowed him to override express provisions preventing him from using those powers domestically,\" said Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman in an opinion piece in the New York Times last week. Democrats are also citing Youngstown v. Sawyer as evidence that Mr. Trump can't call a national emergency to build a border wall. \"Look, if Harry Truman couldn't nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN Sunday. \"So that's a non-starter.\" Ackerman also argued in his piece that calling a national emergency to build a wall would be illegal because of statutes saying that military forces could not be used for domestic purposes.

            "article_content": "The newly sworn-in Rep. Rashida Tlaib is not holding back on how she feels about President Trump.\u00a0 Tlaib, a Democrat from Michigan who is among the first female Muslims to serve in Congress, used profane language to express her hope to impeach Mr. Trump in a reception with supporters hosted by liberal group MoveOn.org.\u00a0 \"And when your son looks at you and says, 'Momma, look you won. Bullies don't win.' And I said, 'Baby, they don't.' Because we're going to go in there, we're going to impeach the motherf*****,\" Tlaib said, to vigorous cheers from the people around her in the video posted to Twitter by immigration activist Nestor Ruiz. Tlaib, an attorney and former state legislator who is the daughter of Palestinian immigrants, also co-authored authored an op-ed in the Detroit Free Press with the title, \"Now is the time to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\"\u00a0 \"We already have overwhelming evidence that the president has committed impeachable offenses, including, just to name a few: obstructing justice; violating the emoluments clause; abusing the pardon power; directing or seeking to direct law enforcement to prosecute political adversaries for improper purposes; advocating illegal violence and undermining equal protection of the laws; ordering the cruel and unconstitutional imprisonment of children and their families at the southern border; and conspiring to illegally influence the 2016 election through a series of hush money payments,\" the op-ed said.\u00a0 Tlaib's congressional office in D.C., newly moved into, did not answer the phone and didn't have the option of leaving a message. But a Friday morning tweet indicated she isn't backing down.\u00a0 \"This is not just about Donald Trump. This is about all of us. In the face of this constitutional crisis, we must rise,\" she wrote.\u00a0 But not even Democrats are welcoming Tlaib's comments. Newly elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered no comment on Tlaib's words. When asked if she would talk to Tlaib about her remarks, Pelosi retorted: \"I'm going talk to the president about his remarks.\" Rep. Jerry Nadler, the new Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he didn't like Tlaib's language \u2014 or the gist behind it. The House Judiciary Committee would initiate any impeachment efforts. \"I don't really like that kind of language, but more to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts,\" Nadler said on CNN Friday morning. Oversight Chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, whose committee will conduct many of the investigations into the Trump administration, told reporters this morning, \"You cannot accomplish much of anything unless you have civility and show respect for your colleagues, and I think those kinds of comments do not take us in the right direction. So I would say they are inappropriate.\" Cummings added he was \"not at all\" worried about his colleagues talking about impeachment because he believes \"there are a lot of people in America who are asking for impeachment.\" Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan colleague of Tlaib's, stressed, \"She's one member!\" and said personally that \"impeachment would tear this country apart.\"\u00a0 A few Democrats, like Rep. Al Green, backed the idea and said impeachment talk was not a distraction. \"We have always been able to walk and chew gun at the same time. I don't see any reason why that shouldn't prevail currently, I think there is great work to be done and this is part of that great work,\" Green said.\u00a0 Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy expressed his anger with Tlaib's comments Friday. \"That action should not stand. Somebody should stand up to her,\" he said. Bo Erickson and Grace Segers contributed reporting Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The White House and Capitol Hill appear no closer to a deal after a meeting with President Trump, Democrats and Republicans in the Situation Room on the 12th day of the partial government shutdown Wednesday.\u00a0 There is no clear pathway to ending the shutdown, with Democrats insisting they don't want to fund the president's proposed border wall, and Mr. Trump demanding his wall be funded \u2014 although he's been unclear on exactly what he would sign. When Democrats' first day in control of the House begins Thursday, they'll introduce legislation to reopen the government. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he won't bring a bill to the floor until he knows the president will sign it. Incoming House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Mr. Trump invited them back to the White House on Friday, after leadership races are set in stone. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, presumptive incoming Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats attended the White House meeting Wednesday.\u00a0 \"We had a long discussion, the president asked us to come back on Friday after the leadership races I think that was a concern for some people to be able to get through,\" McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. \"We never did get through the complete briefing from the secretary of homeland which we are concerned about because we do have a crisis on the border right now. We had a violent mob rush yesterday where we had a challenge there but we know that we have a challenge along the border. We want to solve that issue we want to make sure we open this government up.\" Schumer said Mr. Trump couldn't give him a good answer when asked why the president wouldn't support Democratic legislation to reopen the government.\u00a0 \"We asked the president to support the bills that we support that will open up government,\" Schumer said. \"We asked him to give us one good reason. I asked him directly, I said, Mr. President, give me one good reason why you should continue your shutdown of the eight Cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on homeland security. He could not give a good answer. So, we would hope that they would reconsider and would support the very bills that passed the Senate.\" A White House official told CBS News the general sentiment in the room was that it would be easier to continue discussions after Pelosi's leadership election on Friday. Pelosi told NBC News in an interview that will air Thursday she will not approve any legislation that includes border wall funding, a sticking point for Mr. Trump.\u00a0 The White House official said Mr. Trump started off the meeting, then handed it to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to begin her briefing on border security and illegal immigration. Shortly into the briefing, according to the official, Nielsen was interrupted when Schumer whispered to Pelosi and Pelosi objected to what was being discussed. The official, Pelosi said, took issue with basic figures Nielsen presented, such as the number of criminal illegal immigrants who attempted to cross the border last year.\u00a0 But when Schumer asked Mr. Trump, according to a source familiar with what happened in the room, why he wouldn't support the legislation funding non-Department of Homeland Security agencies to reopen much of the government, the president didn't offer a reason. When Schumer pressed Mr. Trump a third time for a good reason to not re-open the agencies, Mr. Trump responded, \"I would look foolish if I did that,\" the source said.\u00a0 The Situation Room, intended for highly classified material, is by nature closed to the press, meaning there were no televised theatrics like the infamous meeting in December when Mr. Trump told Schumer and Pelosi he would be\u00a0\"proud\" to shut down the government\u00a0over border security.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

The Republican Congress was completely derelict in its responsibility to provide oversight,\" Nadler said on \"CBS This Morning\" Wednesday. \"We're going to provide that oversight. We're going to use the subpoena power if we have to.\" Nadler said that the Judiciary Committee will also hold hearings on\u00a0the December deaths of two migrant children\u00a0in Border Patrol custody. \"This is inhuman and it's not precedented,\" he said, referring to the White House's hardline immigration agenda. \"It's a deliberate creation of the Trump administration, which is trying to make things as miserable as possible. And if kids die, they're apparently willing to have that.\" The veteran New York lawmaker said House Democrats will use their investigative committee powers over the administration to probe the White House's\u00a0controversial migrant family separation policy\u00a0\u2014 which\u00a0it was forced to rescind after a massive public uproar\u00a0\u2014 as well as the appointment of Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who has previously denounced special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in U.S. elections and alleged coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\u00a0 Still, Nadler stressed that his committee, which has the authority to initiate impeachment proceedings against federal officials, will only hold impeachment hearings against the president if certain criteria are met. \u00a0 \"Impeachment is designed as a defense of the republic against a president who would aggrandize power, destroy liberty, destroy Democratic institutions, destroy the separations of power,\" he said. \"If that happens, if you get real evidence of that, then you have to consider impeachment hearings.\" \"There's certainly a lot of allegations, but we'll have to wait and see what the Mueller investigation comes up with and other investigations looking into it,\" Nadler added. Asked about the partial government shutdown and impasse in budget negotiations between lawmakers and the White House over Mr. Trump's unwavering demand for $5 billion in funding to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Nadler said his fellow House Democrats intend to pass six appropriations bills to fund most of the government and a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) until Feb. 8.\u00a0 Because his party's proposals do not include any additional funding for a border wall, it is unlikely that they will be backed by the president and a Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet with top congressional Republicans and Democrats on Wednesday\u00a0to discuss the stalemate in negotiations. \u00a0\u00a0 Nadler said the partial shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, is Mr. Trump's attempt to \"blackmail\" the American public because he feels \"beleaguered\" by criticism from his own party, high-profile resignations in his administration and looming Democratic control of the House.\u00a0 \"It is an extremist policy designed to appeal to an extremist base and hold the whole country hostage,\" he said.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

Sir, I want to get right to this conversation my colleague Scott Pelley had on 60 MINUTES with former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe where he described a conversation about the 25th Amendment, the mechanism through which to push the President out of office. And he said it was brought up to him by the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.  (Begin VT)  ANDREW MCCABE (60 MINUTES): Discussion of the 25th Amendment was-- was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  SCOTT PELLEY (60 MINUTES): Rosenstein was actually openly talking about whether there was a majority of the cabinet who would vote to remove the President.  ANDREW MCCABE: That's correct. Counting votes or possible votes.  SCOTT PELLEY: What seemed to be coursing through the mind of the deputy attorney general was getting rid of the President of the United States.  ANDREW MCCABE: Well--  SCOTT PELLEY: --one way or another.  ANDREW MCCABE: I can't confirm that. But what I can say is the deputy attorney general was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.  SCOTT PELLEY: How did he bring up the idea of the 25th Amendment to you?  ANDREW MCCABE: Honestly, I don't remember. He-- it was just another kind of topic that he jumped to in the midst of-- of-- of a wide ranging conversation.  SCOTT PELLEY: Seriously? Just--  ANDREW MCCABE: Yeah.  SCOTT PELLEY: --another topic?  ANDREW MCCABE: Yeah.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, that's a tremendous allegation to make. Have you ever asked Rod Rosenstein if, in fact, that conversation happened?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (Judiciary Committee Chairman/R-South Carolina/@LindseyGrahamSC): While he's publicly denied it, but, the whole point of Congress existing is to provide oversight of the executive branch. So through good reporting by 60 MINUTES, there's an allegation by the acting FBI director at the time that the deputy attorney general was basically trying to do an administrative coup, take the President down through the 25th Amendment process. The deputy attorney general denies it. So I promise your viewers the following; that we will have a hearing about who's telling the truth, what actually happened. Mister Cabe, you remember, was dismissed from the FBI for leaking information to the press. So you got to remember the source here.  MARGARET BRENNAN: There has been some parsing though of whether these were extended discussions versus conversations about the 25th Amendment.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know whether those conversations have taken place?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No, but I think everybody in the country needs to know if it happened. It's stunning to me that one of the chief law enforcement officers of the land, the acting head of the FBI, would go on national television and say, oh, by the way, I remember a conversation with the deputy attorney general about trying to find if we could replace the President under the 25th Amendment. We're a democracy. People enforce the law, can't take it into their own hands. And was this an attempted bureaucratic coup? I don't know. I don't know who's telling the truth. I know Rosenstein has vehemently denied it but we are going to get to the bottom of it. I do know there was a lot of monkey business about FISA warrants being issued against Carter Page, about dossiers coming from Russia that were unverified. Mister Mueller is going to look at the Trump campaign as he should to see if they violated any laws during the 2016 election. And I'm going to do everything I can to get to the bottom of the Department of Justice FBI behavior toward President Trump and his campaign.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but by even framing it as you just did there, Senator, are you concerned that by investigating the investigators you are adding to some damage of the credibility of the FBI?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Quite the opposite. If it happened we need to clean it up. The FBI has gotten off track in the past. It's one of the greatest organizations in the world. The Hoover years have proven to be pretty dark periods for the FBI. The latter part of the Hoover days where politicians were being blackmailed. There is no organization beyond scrutiny. There is no organization that can't withstand scrutiny. And the FBI will come out stronger. But we got to get to the bottom of it. What are people to think after they watch 60 MINUTES when they hear this accusation by the acting deputy-- acting FBI director that the deputy attorney general encouraged him to try to find ways to count votes to replace the President? That can't go unaddressed. And it will be addressed. That's what oversight is all about.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you subpoena McCabe and Rosenstein to appear?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: How can I not, if that's what it takes? I mean you're doing your job. The First Amendment allows you to ask questions of the most powerful people in the country. I know he is selling a book, and we need to take with a grain of salt maybe what Mister McCabe is telling us. But he went on national television and he made an accusation that floors me. You know, I can imagine if the shoe were on the other foot, this would-- if we were talking about getting rid of President Clinton, it'd be front-page news all over the world. Well, we're going to find out what happened here and the only way I know to find out is to call the people in under oath and find out, through questioning, who's telling the truth because the underlying accusation is beyond stunning.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to play another clip from that interview for you.  (Begin VT)  SCOTT PELLEY (60 MINUTES): What was it specifically that caused you to launch the counterintelligence investigation?  ANDREW MCCABE (60 MINUTES): It's many of those same concerns that caused us to be concerned about a national security threat. And the idea is if the President committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the-- of the FBI to negatively impact, or to shut down our investigation of Russia's malign activity, and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, why would a President of the United States do that? So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder, is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this President and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, you voiced support for the Muller probe in the past. Listening to what McCabe just--  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --described there, a-- a troubling pattern of behavior that he as a-- a lifetime investigator saw as a-- a troubling fact pattern, led him to open a counterintelligence investigation into the President of the United States. Can you understand why he came to that conclusion?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I can understand that the American people will get an answer to the question for Mister Mueller. What I can't understand is why Mister McCabe would meet with Page and Strzok to discuss their hatred for President-- Candidate Trump, talking about taking an insurance policy out in case the election went different than they want. So Mueller will tell us about what Trump did or didn't do. I'm going to tell the country about McCabe and the people at the Department of Justice and how they behaved. Did they take the law in their own hands? Did they abuse the FISA warrant process because they had a political agenda? Did their hatred of Trump go so far that they abandoned their role of being law enforcement agents and become advocates for a political cause? We are going to get to the bottom of that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you recognize there that McCabe is laying out the-- the grounds of what he saw as an obstruction of justice attempt.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Mister Mueller will look at that but I think McCabe, Strzok, and Page had a political bias, a political agenda. And I find it odd that the dossier that we used to get the warrant against Carter Page--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --prepared by a foreign agent, paid for by the Democratic Party that they knew to be unreliable, was used on four separate occasions to get a warrant. And I want to know why Comey told the President, \"Here's the dossier. We've got it. We can't verify any of it. We want you to know about it.\" And that same document was used by the FBI and the Department of Justice under oath to tell the court, \"This is reliable information, give us a warrant based on this document.\" I hope your viewers understand that the rule of law works both ways. Somebody has got to watch those who watch us and I intend to watch what McCabe and-- and his crowd did during the 2016 election.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The President just declared a national emergency in regard to getting the funds for his border wall.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of getting those funds though through this emergency action there's about three point six billion of it--  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --that could come from military construction efforts, including construction of a middle school in Kentucky, housing for military families, improvements for bases like Camp Pendleton and Hanscom Air Force Base. Aren't you concerned that some of these projects that were part of legislation that you helped approve in Congress are now going to possibly be cut out?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, the President will have to make a decision where to get the money. Let's just say for a moment that he took some money out of the military construction budget. I would say it's better for the middle-school kids in Kentucky to have a secure border. We'll get them the school they need. But right now we've got a national emergency on our hands. Opioid addiction is going through the roof in this country. Thousands of Americans died last year or dying this year because we can't control the flow of drugs into this country and all of it's coming across the border.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Through ports of entry according to the--  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So the dangers presented by a broken border to me.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --to Customs and Border patrol though. But--  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Both. It's both. It's not just one. For every-- for every one we get God knows how much we miss.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do-- don't you think Congress has ceded too much power to the executive branch? Do you think that you need to more sharply define what constitutes a national emergency so that future presidents can't interpret it as they like?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good question. I think that every member of Congress has watched three Presidents send troops to the border. Bush, Obama, now Trump. Not one of us have complained about deploying forces to the border to secure the border. It's pretty hard for me to understand the legal difference between sending troops and having them build a barrier. What disappoints me is on President Obama's watch as a Republican, I voted for a forty-four-billion-dollar border security package, nine billion of which included barriers.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Two thousand six all of us voted for the Secure Fre-- Fence Act. And we're talking about steel barriers not a concrete wall. And, unfortunately, when it comes to Trump, the Congress is locked down and will not give him what we've given past presidents. So, unfortunately, he's got to do it on his own and I support his decision to go that route.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, perhaps, in the future we can talk about sharpening what constitutes an emergency. But before I let you go you made a pitch from the stage--  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --there at Munich for foreign troops to be committed to Syria alongside American forces.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: How many U.S. forces are needed to stay there and has President Trump actually made that commitment to you?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, that's-- thank you for asking, Margaret. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been destroyed. It has been defeated. All the work is not yet done. Remnants of ISIS are lethal. We need a follow-on presence post caliphate destruction. The good news we can do this with a fraction of American forces we've had in Syria in the past. The real good news is Europeans are willing to contribute because their cities have been attacked from Syria. The caliphate in Syria--  MARGARET BRENNAN: How many U.S. troops?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --has caused thousands of deaths inside of Europe. I think just a fraction, a couple of hundred, compared to twenty-seven hundred would be enough to get Europeans to contribute to the stabilizing force to make sure ISIS doesn't come back like it did in Iraq, to make sure that Turkey and the Kurds don't go to war, to keep them apart, and to make sure Iran doesn't come in and take over when we leave. So, I've never felt better about the outcome in Syria with a small contingent of Americans. A lot of Europeans will come in and help fill in the gap, a very small down payment to secure ISIS never comes back. We've gone from thousands of troops in Iraq and Syria down now to a couple of hundred in Syria. Congratulations, Mister President. The job is not yet done but we've done a hell of a job destroying the caliphate.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, thank you.  We want to turn now to another attendee at the Munich Security Conference, Delaware Democrat Chris Coons. You now have heard the former acting FBI director come public after leaving office about what he saw as grounds for discussion of the 25th Amendment. What do you think of making those details public now?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-Delaware/@ChrisCoons): Well, Margaret, as you heard from Senator Graham this will almost certainly be taken up by the Senate Judiciary Committee. But what's striking to me about this conference and, frankly, around the world is the way in which President Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw from Syria has really unsettled our core allies because he did so without consulting with any of our allies. Candidate Donald Trump ran as someone who would be unconventional, who would break the mold and be unpredictable, and he has certainly over-performed in that category. But what is striking to me about the 60 MINUTES reporting about the conversations that are alleged to have happened at the highest levels of our law enforcement community is that folks who were career professionals were troubled enough by what they saw in terms of President Trump's actions with regard to Russia, that they felt compelled to open a counterintelligence investigation. I think that should give all of us pause.  MARGARET BRENNAN: McCabe himself has been questioned in terms of his own personal behavior. He was fired after an IG investigation found that he lied or lacked candor four times under oath. So do you question the credibility of his claims?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Look the most important thing in my mind is that Robert Mueller be able to complete his investigation without interference. If we also need to have some sunshine, some disinfectant here, about everything that led to the beginning and the pursuit of that investigation that strikes me as appropriate.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So to be clear, when your colleague Senator Graham was talking about wanting to, on the Judiciary Committee, investigate things like abuse of-- of foreign surveillance and the grounds under which warrants were obtained, do you support all of that?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: My hope is that Chairman Graham will be open to calling a number of witnesses who based on previous testimony also need to come in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. We should not be pursuing just one theory or one line of investigation here. We should be looking at all the matters that are appropriate for oversight by the Senate Judiciary Committee.  MARGARET BRENNAN: From what you heard from McCabe himself, the-- the pattern he was describing, is that an appropriate response, or an appropriate potential use of the 25th Amendment?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, I can't speak to that having not heard the entire interview. It is alarming that there were, apparently, folks at the highest levels of our government considering whether or not our President is unfit to serve. I don't think that this frankly rises to the level of some deep state conspiracy or a serious attempt at what Senator Graham called an administrative coup. I suspect that once this is fully discussed it will be clearer that this was a brief or passing conversation that's been taken out of context. But it does deserve scrutiny.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think there should be a joint resolution, an attempt by Congress to stop the President from-- from going forward with this emergency declaration?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, given that what President Trump is trying to do--to build a big wall between the United States and Mexico to meet a campaign promise, something that Congress considered and rejected, that the President wasn't able to secure over two years when Republicans controlled the Congress. I do think Margaret we should take action to disapprove of this excessive use of executive power and make it clear that the article one branch, the Cong-- the Congress is going to jealously defend our right to be the body that decides on federal spending and not let the President use this extreme measure as an end around our appropriations process.  MARGARET BRENNAN: If you do see a Democratic President in that office, would you share that concern? Do you think Congress now needs to put some restrictions on the executive's ability to declare a national emergency?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I do think that we should not set the terrible precedent of letting a President declare a national emergency simply as a way of getting around the congressional appropriation process. Presidents do have emergency powers. They can declare national emergencies. But if you look back at the history of that over the last four decades, they've overwhelmingly been done in the face of legitimate national security threats where there was no time or no other means of addressing them.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a foreign policy issue as well and you brought it up at the beginning of our conversation, and that's Syria. Senator Graham just made a pitch to our allies to commit boots, troops to Syria, and promised that U.S. troops would stay alongside them. What do you make of that pitch?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, this is where Senator Graham and I agree. And the delegation in the meetings that I've been in has been speaking up with one voice, saying that an abrupt and total withdrawal of all American forces from Syria would have a terrible consequence of handing our allies in the fight against ISIS--the Kurds over either to Iran or to the Turks, and that we should be working, in partnership with our allies, to make sure that we don't allow ISIS to reemerge and that we don't allow Iran and Russia to dominate Syria. I'll-- I'll join Senator Graham in congratulating the President and our armed forces in ending the ISIS caliphate, but I think for us to pull all of our forces, literally, every American soldier out of Syria, would be a disastrous--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So how many should stay?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: --and it would have consequences not just for Syria's security but for our allies.  MARGARET BRENNAN: How many should stay then?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: At most a few hundred to secure both the al-Tanf base that is blocking Iran from having a highway right into and across Syria and to secure a buffer zone between our Kurdish partners in the fight against ISIS and the Turks.  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Coons, thank you for joining us.  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Thank you, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in one minute with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Texas Republican Congressman Will Hurd is standing by, so don't go away.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We are back with Texas Republican Congressman Will Hurd. He joins us from his district in San Antonio this morning. Congressman, you are directly impacted by anything at the border since about eight hundred miles of it are in your home district. How is this emergency declaration going to impact your constituents?  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD (R-Texas/@HurdOnTheHill): Well, I have eight hundred twenty miles of-- of the border. I'm the only Republican that represents a-- a border town and I spent almost a decade as an undercover officer in the CIA chasing bad guys all over the world. How is this going to im-- impact my district? First and foremost I don't think we needed a-- a national emergency declaration. That is not a tool that the President needs in order to solve this problem. This is a problem that has existed for-- before Ronald Reagan. And what we need to be doing is-- and is-- and, remember, we just passed a piece of legislation that adds more technology, that has physical barriers in order to-- to solve this problem. And I was just down on the border. I was in the Del Rio sector, the border is-- is broken up into sectors. I was, specifically, in the city of Eagle Pass and then I crossed the border into Mexico in Piedras Negras, and they are dealing with a-- a recent caravan. And guess what? There was unprecedented cooperation between the U.S. government and the Mexican government. We-- we have to remember that most of the people that are coming here illegally are coming from Central America. They are not Mexican citizens. In this one sector I visited, ninety-two percent of the people that are coming there illegally are from Central America and eighty percent of that is, specifically, from Honduras. So this is a shared problem with us and Mexico. And then this new administration in Mexico we've seen this level of cooperation to-- to deal with this shared problem. We need to address things like border patrol pay.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: There-- there's a reason that, you know, border patrol has a retention problem. We don't have enough border patrol officers. We need additional technology. Everybody thinks that there's the latest and greatest technology along the border. It doesn't. This bill we passed last Friday or this Friday recently that got signed into law has a program called the Innovative Tower Initiative which is what I describe as the smart wall and uses technology to figure out what's going on back--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --and forth across our border. But this--  MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the--  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --executive. Go ahead.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but what about the private property that is going to be seized to build the wall that the President is saying he's going to do? That must impact your constituents.  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: Oh, absolutely. In the great state of Texas we care about a little thing called private property and there's going to be over one thousand ranchers and farmers potentially impacted if the government comes in and takes their land. And this is how they do it. They say hey we need this land. Here's what we're going to give you. And they get to automatically take it. And then the rancher or the landowner has to go in and fight in court to make sure that they're at a minimum getting what they-- they-- they-- they are owed because of-- of the price of the land. In some places in a part of the-- the wall is being designed or they think they want to build the wall, we're going to be ceding 1.1 million acres of arable land.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. That's tremendous.  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: This is land that could be-- it's-- It's crazy. It's crazy.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I've got to take a break here so we're going to continue it on the other side.  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: Good. Copy.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Tune in tonight to see Scott Pelley's interview with former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe 7:00 PM Eastern tonight on 60 MINUTES.  We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with more of our conversation with Will Hurd.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're continuing our conversation with Texas Republican Congressman Will Hurd. To pick up where we left off, we were talking about how your home district is going to be impacted by this emergency declaration. Today, White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller told Fox News's Chris Wallace that the White House has the authorities to build a couple hundred miles by the end of the next appropriations cycle, which is September 2020. You sit on House Appropriations. Can Congress or the courts stop the administration from getting the money to do this?  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: Well, this-- the-- what this-- this national emergency declaration does, is it says the President is going to obligate funds-- so he's going to take funds from other places. But you can't spend eight billion dollars in the next six months. And so what I think you're going to see in the next appropriations cycle is restricting some of that funds. And then the question you have is when it comes to military construction, all right, can you take funds from that was going to be used to constructing things the military and you-- you outlined a couple of items earlier in this segment. But how about the fact that in my district, in Del Rio, Texas, this produces more pilots than any other facility in the United States of America. If it rains more than an inch, the flight line gets flooded and they can't train. We've been working on fixing that. We're trying to get more additional funds. If you're going to reprogram money, that-- that's a good place to-- to spend that kind of money rather than trying to-- to build a wall. And we have to remember there's already six hundred and fifty-four miles of wall or barrier or whatever you want to call it--steel fencing. The President has already been authorized over fifty-five million dollars in this last appropriation bill. He was able to-- to reauthorize seven hundred and fifty million dollars within Homeland Security. My concern is our government wasn't designed to operate by national emergency. Unfortunately, a Congress that existed before I was born, usurped some of their power, it gave some of their power away to the executive branch. Our government was designed for the-- the most ultimate power the power of the purse to reside within Congress. And we shouldn't have an executive-- I don't care if it's Republican or Democrat, that tries to get around Congress with this national emergency declaration--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So would you support--  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --that's why this is important.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --a resolution to try to stop the President from doing that?  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: I-- I would support something that reviews who can-- how you de-- declare a national emergency. I would support something that prevents, that actually is going to prevent taking money out of military construction that's going to go to our men and women who are-- who are willing to put on a uniform, put themselves in harm's way. And they need to make sure that we have the tools to-- that they're properly trained and they're properly equipped to do things. So I'm-- I'm always open to making sure that Congress takes back some of this power as a coequal branch of government. And I'm sure there's going to be a lot of conversations. We're almost in uncharted territory now because I think based on my research this is one of the first times that there has been a disagreement between the executive branch and Congress on what is, indeed, a national emergency. It sets a dangerous precedent. But there will be a lot of people focusing on this over the next couple of weeks.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So to be clear you are saying that this wall that you don't think the United States needs--  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --on national security grounds, will actually adversely impact national security because it will hurt the readiness of some of these military bases in your district?  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: If you're taking money away from the military, we just spent the last four years rebuilding our military, making sure the men and women in-- in our armed forces have the tools that they need. I don't want to see that-- that money being taken away from that. This, we went through a number of hearings and investigations in order to figure out where that money needs to go. And so that is how our government is supposed to operate. Yes, we have--  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you are confident that Congress can stop that money from being raided from those military construction funds? The three point six billion?  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: I-- I would say that people will be exploring how that can ultimately be done because we're in uncharted territory. But I want to also make it clear that sixty-seven billion dollars' worth of drugs are coming into our country. Four hundred thousand people came to our country illegally last year. We-- we have a problem at our border, we don't have what I call operational control of our border, meaning we know everything that's going back and forth across our border. So this is a problem.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: And the only way we solve the problem is looking at all two thousand miles of our southern border at the same time. And the only way you can do that is with manpower and technology. In some places, a physical barrier makes sense where there's urban-to-urban contact. Again, we already have six hundred and fifty-four miles--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --of-- of physical barrier. So we've got to be thinking about the strategy, not a focus on just one tool within that strategy.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you very much for joining us this Sunday.  We will be right back with our panel.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to bring in our panel now for some political analysis. David Nakamura covers the White House for The Washington Post. Rachael Bade covers Congress and she has just moved over to The Washington Post. She is also a CNN political analyst. We want to welcome Eugene Scott to this broadcast. He is also with The Washington Post. And Leslie Sanchez is a CBS News contributor and a very familiar face to our viewers who tune into CBSN, our digital network. Leslie, let me start with you. You heard the President lay out his case for this emergency. New York Times, though, in terms of writing about the fallout said it was the most punishing defeat Mister Trump has experienced as a President. Do you agree?  LESLIE SANCHEZ (CBS News Political Contributor/@LeslieSanchez): I-- I don't think Republicans are going to agree on that. What-- what's interesting, I was speaking to a lot of the legislative leaders and business leaders along the Texas-Mexico border, and they feel this is not a real solution but a political one. But if you look at the fact that there is a tremendous amount of baseline support to secure the border, where the President does not have the support is over sixty percent, according to what Gallup has been looking at, some other research, don't support the idea of a physical wall. So when it's get-- it's parsing those words. I think, Margaret, if he can show he is securing with both technology, technical infrastructure, human capital, you know, all the things that border enforcement is saying they need, then I think he is going to get a legislative win on that. However, if it just looks like a contiguous-- contiguous border, he is not. And I-- I do want to point out, the President has walked that back.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: He was on numerous occasions saying, you know, what does the look, the-- the wall go the entire two-thousand-mile border. But that's not the reality. So for that-- with that extent and that in mind I think we're making progress.  RACHAEL BADE (The Washington Post/@rachaelmbade): Can this follow up on, you know, you mentioned that this is a political solution. Republicans on the Hill feel the same way. And they are very annoyed in some cases that they are being sort of unwittingly dragged into the President's 2020 reelection effort. You know the President feels, that Trump, and that declaring this emergency is going to help his own reelection. But this is dividing lawmakers. And you just saw that with your interviews right there with Will Hurd saying this was a bad idea that he could see constituents have their land seized and then it would be taking money from the military with people like Lindsey Graham saying, oh, you know, this is going to secure our country. And so right now it's really dividing the party.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: Just real quick on that part, and also in the conference there was a-- a big point of saying, not only with-- with Congressman Hurd, but Congressman Henry Cuellar, who is also on the board of the Democrats saying we want topography, the local law, you know, leaders to be involved in the discussion because you don't want to be building, you know, eminent domain on--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: --people's land, the issues of livestock and using the Rio Grande for other purposes. So there is a lot of-- of disagreement on how that's done, but now that the-- the President is backpedaling on how you secure the border, I think there could be a positive.  DAVID NAKAMURA (The Washington Post/@DavidNakamura): I mean that one thing was whether this is a win or a loss for the President. I mean the President wants to be seen as the ultimate winner here. But just look at his news conference in announcing this, it took him about five minutes to even get to the idea that he was declaring in a national emergency. He was acknowledging it was probably going to be stopped in court. He didn't act like a winner in, sort of, announcing this in the Rose Garden the way he did. He took questions on a lot of other topics, which is fine. We want to hear him make news, but if he really believed in what was doing here, believe this was a really, truly winning strategy, I think he would have-- you would have seen a-- a much more determinative announcement in the way that he rolled that out.  EUGENE SCOTT (The Washington Post/@Eugene_Scott): One of the reasons I believe that the President was not able to communicate the national emergency in a winsome way is because it's not winsome. It's widely unpopular with many people outside of his base, which is where the majority of voters are. We know that this is an approach that is popular with Republicans who back Trump, but we know that he won because so many independents came over to support him. And he needs those votes, as well, if he is going to do well in 2020. And recent polling, especially after the midterm, shows that he is not doing well with those voters.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Rachael, I want to ask you about the other news we have here from that tremendous interview with 60 MINUTES and Andrew McCabe. Look, McCabe is gone. Jim Comey is gone. There is a new attorney general, Bill Barr, who is now on the job, and Senator Lindsey Graham is now in the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee. So where does all of this head next?  RACHAEL BADE: That-- that story is not over. McCabe maybe gone, Rosenstein is heading toward the exits, but this whole notion about this 25th Amendment and whether there was actually a conversation to try to oust the President or see if there was support to oust the President Republicans are going to continue in that vein. And it's interesting from this interview, it looks like Lindsey Graham as chairman of the Judiciary Committee is going to pick up right where House Republicans left off when they lost the majority and Democrats took over, you know. Before the past two years, Republicans in the House, they've sort of been doing this--investigate the investigator, sort of, an inquiry about whether there is bias at the FBI or the Justice Department. That has gone away. They have lost their subpoena power. And Graham is showing that he is not only going to pick that up, he potentially is going to go even further by telling you that he is willing to subpoena Rosenstein and bring in McCabe to actually ask them what happened with these conversations.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Where does that fit in, Eugene, to the political strategy here in terms of laying the groundwork for the Mueller report?  EUGENE SCOTT: Well, I would imagine that, in part, it is to keep people questioning Mueller and the bias that the President believes exists within the FBI, that's working against him, is-- is the whole witch-hunt idea, just taken to the next step, trying to put some meat, some-- on those bones, and looking at people like Lindsey Graham to be able to do that and argue that the President's suspicions are credible and they are not irrational. Whether or not they are actually going to be able to do that, people are still waiting to see. But what we do know is that most Americans, according to polling we have in The Washington Post, want to see this investigation continue because they do believe that Mueller is more likely to be credible than the President himself.  MARGARET BRENNAN: David, switching gears here, we heard overnight that Heather Nauert, who had been at the State Department as an undersecretary and as a spokesperson there, is withdrawing her name from consideration to be the next U.N. Ambassador. What happened? Why did she do that?  DAVID NAKAMURA: What we understand is that her nomination was languishing in part because her own team had not even forwarded all their necessary paperwork to the Senate Committee that would have to do her oversight hearing. And I think the reason now we're finding out is that she actually employed a nanny who was in the country legally from another county, but had not been necessarily had a work permit to work here legally, taxes were not being paid on time. Nauert had, apparently, flagged this internally, but it's become something of an issue of this potentially being a problem and a disqualifying measure--something that would be embarrassing not only to her family, but also could stand in the way from the Senate moving forward. This is a blow to the administration, though, because she is certainly someone I think that the President had grown to trust her role as a spokeswoman at the State Department. And he had his own-- President Trump had had his own problems with the previous U.N. Secretary Nikki Haley in some cases.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  DAVID NAKAMURA: And he believed this would be someone who would be very loyal to him, but he-- they now seem to be making the decision to move on.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Leslie, is it disqualifying?  LESLIE SANCHEZ: For some, it is; for some, it's not. It just reminds me of the 1993 Nannygate when you had the revelations, you know, that Bill Clinton was trying to nominate not one but two attorney generals that both had issues with nannies who were undocumented. But in more recent history under Bill Clinton, and even if you think about under Trump, Wilbur Ross, who had undocumented-- perhaps they didn't pay taxes on people that worked domestically in their household, they managed to get through. So they are threading that needle. I don't think-- I think it's changed a lot in that conversation. But, again, going back to our first topic, it becomes an issue of labor and undocumented individuals working in these households and not paying taxes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Rachael, you know, some have put this in the context of the President has had this happen with a few different nominees or at least people he said he is going to nominate. Is the White House really setting up their selections for success? The President's tweeting this morning blaming Democrats for stalling his ambassadors from being confirmed.  RACHAEL BADE: Yeah. I mean, look, that's just a way to sort of shift the narrative and try to point the finger. I mean there's been complaints, including by some Republicans on the Hill, that White House does not do enough to vet people before they actually put them forward. And so, yeah, this has-- this has been an issue. I mean, Mick Mulvaney, now the acting chief of staff, he had his own issue with not playing taxes for, again, I believe it was a nanny. So, again, this is-- it's an embarrassment for the administration. And Republicans would like to see them button that up before they actually move people forward.  DAVID NAKAMURA: And it comes on the heels of all this reporting in the Washington Post and other places, the New York Times, about the President's own employment of undocumented workers at his golf club for years at a time that he was running for President and railing on the use of undocumented immigrants, now declaring this a national emergency. So this would have fed into all sorts of other questions that Congress and certainly as Democratic lawmakers will want to ask.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Eugene, we had two of our senators as guests from Munich, from the Security Conference. And there has been a lot said about the importance-- or the statement being made to have such a big congressional delegation at what is a conference billed around celebrating alliances, something that the administration is often criticized for not valuing enough. You had former Vice President Biden there. You had the current Vice President Mike Pence there. What was the reaction like in terms of Pence's message to the room?  EUGENE SCOTT: Well, for the most part, it was silent. There was a lack of confidence in the message that Mike Pence was delivering suggesting that the America first mindset that the President has been campaigning on and leading since entering the Oval Office is of the best interest for the world as a whole. On multiple occasions, lines that he's used to receiving applause and taking breaks for were met with silence, in part, because we know that many of our European allies do not see the United States as any longer a world leader when it comes to security issues and-- and boldly disagree with much of what the President has put forward. And it's telling to see how surprised Pence himself was that he wasn't met with the same type of support that he usually is met with when he's making these same statements on the campaign trail or within groups in-- here in the States that have used-- are used to supporting him and backing what the President believes to be in the best interest for the county and the world.  MARGARET BRENNAN: David, in contrast to that, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, was well received.  DAVID NAKAMURA: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Her remarks-- it was noted she said she doesn't understand how possibly her country could be called a national security threat when BMWs are made in the United States these days. You know it was almost like a laugh line at the President's trade policies here, and saying here that he's vacating space to Iran. Our closest allies are really at a distance.  DAVID NAKAMURA: Yeah. It's no surprise that Angela Merkel's been at odds with President Trump, but she seemed, in this case, to be unbound by any concerns about her own political future given that she's probably not-- said she won't pursue another term as chancellor. But think about this: I was just thinking about last September at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. President Trump came up and said he had done more than any other President in two years. He got laughed at. He went to France and Paris for the hundredth year anniversary of World War I and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, came up and delivered a very pointed rebuke of-- of nationalism and things that Trump has talked about, with Trump right there in the audience. And now Vice President Pence goes to this Munich Security Conference and basically he is greeted with silence. I mean what's worse getting laughed at or having sort of radio silence? I'm not sure what's worse? But there's continues to be this message, and Angela Merkel on her final sort of tour here, I mean, a couple of years will be continuing to deliver this, you know, pointed rebuke of Trump.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: I think that's why you saw a lot of lawmakers joining at Munich--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: --this weekend, because they wanted to go there to reassure our allies that we are still on your side. I mean Vice President-- former Vice President Joe Biden also gave a speech to the audience, talking about how when I travel around the country and I talk to Americans, Americans still see you guys as vitable to-- important to our national security, that we still want to be in NATO, and we're not looking at leaving NATO. Even the President had talked about doing such a couple of weeks ago. So you're seeing this sort of bipartisan pushback on the President, including several votes in the House and the Senate where they've actually rebuked the President's foreign policy. So we're just going to have to see as time goes on, are more Republicans breaking with him on that to push back and sort of reclaim our standing in the world?  MARGARET BRENNAN: I think it's an important point and believe it they are on that. Also interesting that, Vice President Biden, former vice president was there. We haven't heard a lot from those who are expected to throw their hat into the ring for 2020 on national security. But he staked that out, at least for the weekend.  We'll be back in a moment with former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, who's here to talk about his new book, Beyond Charlottesville: Taking a Stand Against White Nationalism. It's out in July and looks at what led to the violent Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville and how Virginia and the country continue to deal with racism. Good to have you here.  TERRY MCAULIFFE (Former Governor of Virginia/@Terry McAuliffe/Beyond Charlottesville): It's my pleasure.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Certainly your state of Virginia continues to deal with racism. The-- Governor Northam, who we heard from last week, has refused to resign, despite near universal calls among elected Democrats to do so. Can he survive?  TERRY MCAULIFFE: Yes. I think he's made a decision he's going to stay in, but the way that Ralph survives and brings Virginia back together, he's got to lean in on these very important issues, which I talk about in the book. He's got to use executive authority as governor. You know I used executive authority. I took the Confederate flag off the Virginia license plates. I banned the box on any state employment forms. And, as you know, I restored the felon rights of hundred and seventy-three individuals, more than any governor in U.S. history. I was sued by the Republicans. We ultimately won. And the reason I was so adamant about doing that was because of Virginia's racial history. It goes back to the Jim Crow laws. In 1902 a state senator disenfranchised felons, a poll tax and a literacy test to put it in our constitution. And his quote that day is, \"I am doing this to eliminate the darkie from being a political factor in Virginia.\" Well, a hundred and fourteen years later, there was new sheriff in town. And I was able to enfranchise all these people to give them a second chance. And this is what our leadership in Virginia needs to do. We need to lean in. We've had a horrible history. You look at Charlottesville, Margaret, I can't even say to you on TV what I heard that day against members of the African-American community and members of the Jewish faith. These people walking down the streets, you know, they used to wear hoods. They used to do it at night because they were embarrassed. They don't feel they have to wear hoods anymore. And they can do it in broad daylight. Something has gone wrong in our country. And I talk in the book about how we got to bring our country back together again.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  TERRY MCAULIFFE: We've got to deal with the issues of the past, but we need to go forward.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What about Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, who faces sexual assault charges. Can he survive?  TERRY MCAULIFFE: Very serious allegations have been made. They need to be investigated. He has called for an investigation. The two women have called for an investigation. I believe this week in Massachusetts--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  TERRY MCAULIFFE:--they've opened up an investigation, and I believe that Duke University has opened up an investigation. So we will go through that process. What I'm hoping now is what has happened here that, you know, we're a great state. And I was very proud as governor. I eliminated all the horrible biases that we had. Remember when I came into office, the Republicans had wanted to shut all the women's clinics down. We had horrible legislation against women, the transvaginal bill, horrible legislation against members of the LGB-- we got rid of all that. We became open, welcoming. That's why we got Amazon. There was no question. You know, I put the bid in--  MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about that.  TERRY MCAULIFFE: Yeah. That's why we got Amazon. You cannot succeed, as a governor, you cannot grow your state unless you're perceived as open and welcoming to everyone.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, so New York, as you know, Amazon pulled out of New York after they had bid for this--  TERRY MCAULIFFE: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --facility there, but some of the outcry locally and then nationally from progressives was saying this is a win against big corporations. This is a win for little-- the little guy. I mean, for you, what do you think the impact is? Does this in any way paint the Democratic Party, as well, as anti-business?  TERRY MCAULIFFE: I certainly hope not. Listen, I put the bid in for Amazon in September '17 while I was governor. Before I put the bid in, I worked with my state legislators, I worked with all of the local immunities in Northern Virginia and Richmond and Hampton Roads. So when our bid went in, everybody was all in. I cannot, for the life of you understand, after this bid went in, why the locals came out against it. You should have done the due diligence before you submitted the bid. It just doesn't make any sense. But, more importantly, our bid, we won and we're going to create twenty-five, up to thirty-seven thousand jobs in Virginia, high-paying jobs, you've got to build an economy for the future. I just read a report that artificial intelligence will eliminate forty percent of the world's jobs in the next two decades. You better be creating new twenty-first century jobs. We welcome Amazon. Now, they don't get any money until they come in, create the jobs and pay the taxes. It's all how you structure the deal. So if Jeff Bezos, if you're watching here, thank you for coming to Virginia. You don't want to go to New York. I would tell you bring the other jobs to Virginia. We are an open, welcoming, dynamic state. We're the number one state for cyber, for data, for unmanned systems.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I've got to-- before I let you go, though, ask you, March 31st, you set as your deadline to announce--  TERRY MCAULIFFE: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --whether you're running for President. What are you waiting for? Is it Joe Biden?  TERRY MCAULIFFE: I'm not. I have spoken within the vice president. I have made hundreds and hundreds of calls across the country, talked to potential staff. And, listen, we're close to making a decision. I want to see where the field is. I do think we need in this race a progressive governor who was very jobs-oriented, very successful in economic development. They're not mutually exclusive. A governor is a CEO. We build roads, we fix roads. We do need governors in this race, because, you know, we don't just get to talk all day.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  TERRY MCAULIFFE: We got to deliver every single day.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'd love to have you back--  TERRY MCAULIFFE: Thanks, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --and talk about it when you're ready to make a decision--  TERRY MCAULIFFE: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --governor.  We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Population data collected from the 2020 census could lead to dramatic changes in how congressional seats and Electoral College votes are apportioned in several states. Ten states, including several in the Northeast and Midwest, are set to lose congressional districts, although seven in the West and South could gain seats, according to an analysis of new Census Bureau data. The results of the census will be used to determine how 435 seats in the House seats are apportioned for the next 10 years. This impacts a state's political power in Congress and importance in presidential elections, as Electoral College votes are determined by the size of a state's congressional delegation. The reapportionment is expected in December 2020, resulting in the lengthy process of each state redrawing congressional maps for the 2022 midterm elections. The Census Bureau released its final population estimates ahead of next year's census in a\u00a0report on Monday. An analysis of the figures by the consulting group\u00a0Election Data Services\u00a0shows the 10 states set to lose a congressional district: Among the seven states set to gain seats, Texas and Florida are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries, gaining at least three and two congressional districts respectively. That would give Texas the second-largest number of congressional districts and electoral votes in the country, behind California. Texas is increasingly becoming a battleground state in presidential elections, due to demographic change and growing urban populations. According to the Census Bureau data, Texas had the second highest number of new residents from other countries between July 2018 and July 2019, behind California, and the second highest number of new residents from elsewhere in the U.S. over the same time period, behind Florida. Florida is also a critical state in presidential elections. The winner of every election since 1996 has captured the Sunshine State. Arizona, Colorado, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon are each set to gain one congressional district, according to Election Data Services. Among the states set to lose a seat, population decline in Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Pennsylvania in particular demonstrate the continued contraction in former industrial powerhouses. The 2020 census has been a subject of much debate and litigation over the past year, as the Trump administration attempted to add a question about citizenship. Opponents argued that this would lead to an undercounting of the population\u00a0in states with large numbers of undocumented immigrants, which in turn could lead to lower apportionment in Congress. In June, the Supreme Court ruled against including the proposed citizenship question, saying the administration's explanation for including it was insufficient. President Trump abandoned the effort soon after, saying his administration would collect data on citizenship by other means. \u00a0 Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

He's got the authority to be the director of the orchestra, and that's how I think he views the presidency.

Ted Cruz last year.\u00a0 \"There were some really wonderful people that [said], 'could you please get him to stop swearing so much?'\" she recalled.\u00a0 \"But at the same time, I think Beto is at his best when he's just being himself and unfiltered, and speaking honestly and directly. And so if that means there's a curse word from time to time, I'd rather him be himself. I'd rather him be himself then try to stifle that,\" she added later. Amy O'Rourke spoke with CBS News at the tail end of her Nevada debut, on the sidelines of a volunteer phone-banking event in Las Vegas. The trip is only her second solo outing for the campaign, following\u00a0a visit last week\u00a0to New Hampshire.\u00a0 \"When you're running for president, it's hard to be in every state and meet people as you would in local races,\" said Amy O'Rourke. \"I'm trying to go and meet people on my own and then bring those stories back and be able to talk with Beto about them and share people's perspectives,\" she explained. As Beto O'Rourke was leading an\u00a0\"equity\u00a0and justice\" roundtable\u00a0in California, his wife kicked off Thursday with an intimate, at-times emotional breakfast with Latina leaders and small business owners in Las Vegas.\u00a0 \"On August 17th, the police came to my house for my undocumented husband. By August 20th, my 14-year-old committed suicide,\" one attendee recounted to O'Rourke, through tears.\u00a0 She met later with Roxann McCoy, president of the Las Vegas branch of the NAACP. And as her husband headed to\u00a0a town hall in Colorado, she sat down with gun control activists, shooting survivors, and fellow Moms Demand Action members. \"Campaigns can be tough, and they're long and they're hard. And hearing those stories, it makes you want to fight that much harder every day,\" Amy O'Rourke reflected. Despite a high-profile\u00a0campaign relaunch\u00a0and\u00a0a viral moment\u00a0out of the third Democratic presidential debate, the former Texas congressman has amassed comparatively little support against frontrunners Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren.\u00a0 In a\u00a0recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll\u00a0across the early presidential nominating contests, Beto O'Rourke cleared two points in only one state: Nevada. Wesley Powers-Sabugo, whose Las Vegas home hosted Amy O'Rourke's final event of the day, told CBS News he had only one complaint out of Beto O'Rourke's performance on stage in Houston. \"I wished he would have used harder words,\" Powers-Sabugo joked.\u00a0 \"We love it when he swears. He's very passionate and it was very authentic.\" CBS News reporter covering public health and the pandemic.",

            "article_content": "A Democratic Virginia state lawmaker interrupted President Trump's Jamestown speech Tuesday directly in front of the stage where the president was standing, declaring, \"President Trump, you can't send us back, Virginia is our home.\" Ibraheem Samirah, who is Muslim, held up a sign with the words \"Deport Hate,\" sparking boos and chants of \"Trump, Trump, Trump\" from some in the audience. The president temporarily halted his speech, and Samirah was escorted from the event by law enforcement. \u00a0 The interruption comes after the president has spent weeks deriding progressive women of color, and after he spent the last few days blasting Rep. Elijah Cummings, who is black, over living conditions in Baltimore. Multiple Virginia officials boycotted the Tuesday event commemorating the 400th anniversary of the first representative legislative assembly over Mr. Trump's rhetoric, and Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney resigned from a committee planning the ceremony.\u00a0 Samirah posted a lengthy statement to Twitter after the incident, declaring the president a \"racist-in-chief\" who \"openly stokes hate against immigrants.\"\u00a0 \"400 years ago today, a group of undocumented immigrants formed a government to rule this commonwealth, beginning a centuries long tradition of people from across the world immigrating here for a chance at safety, democracy, and prosperity; my parents, who are Palestinian refugees, included. The fact that the racist-in-chief, who so openly stokes hate against immigrants, was even invited to this event is insulting to Virginians and insulting to the history of our commonwealth's democracy,\" the statement said. Virginia's Speaker of the House of Delegates, Kirk Cox, said the young lawmaker's conduct violated House rules.\u00a0 \"I am disappointed by Delegate Ibraheem Samirah's disrespectful outburst during the president's remarks. It was not only inconsistent with common decency, it was also a violation of the rules of the House.\" Samirah himself was in a special election in which his opponent accused him of previous anti-Semitic remarks. Samirah was forced eventually to apologize.\u00a0 The president later told reporters he didn't think Samirah looked very good, and complained that the media gave \"100 percent\" of the coverage to the protester and none to his speech.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's rhetoric has sparked debate about how the president addresses minorities. A new Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday found 51% of Americans think the president is racist, compared to 43% who do not think he is racist.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "President Trump spoke before the National Association of Realtors Friday afternoon, beginning his speech by announcing that the U.S. would be lifting steel and aluminum tariffs. \"We've just reached an agreement with Canada and Mexico and we'll be selling our product into those countries without the imposition of tariffs or major tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said. He expressed hope that Congress will approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement. He did, however, say that his increase on tariffs on Chinese products and China's retaliatory tariffs was \"worth it,\" to ensure that China would stop cheating the U.S. through trade. Acknowledging that these tariffs have had a negative effect on farmers -- many of whom supported Mr. Trump in 2016 -- Mr. Trump called them patriots, saying \"we're taking care of our farmers\" and he has \"never heard a complaint.\" \"Farmers are incredible. I don't know. They may even be better than the realtors!\" Mr. Trump cracked. Mr. Trump, who has a background as a real estate mogul, spent much of his speech cracking jokes to laughs and applause from the audience. He acknowledged that his speech was \"all off-cuff,\" because he knew more about how to talk to realtors. The president also spoke extensively about the economy. Bragging about low unemployment among women, Mr. Trump joked that \"men should sue the women for discrimination.\" Mr. Trump also criticized the press for reporting on the recent escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran, saying that there was no conflict in the administration over whether to go to war with Iran. He condemned the use of anonymous sourcing in reporting. \"There is no source. The person does not exist. The person is not alive. It's bullshit,\" he claimed without basis. He also insulted the numerous Democratic candidates running for president in 2020: \"Some of these people are stone cold crazy.\" The president spent much of Friday morning preoccupied on Twitter with Attorney General William Barr's assertion that the Trump campaign was surveilled. \"My Campaign for President was conclusively spied on. Nothing like this has ever happened in American Politics. A really bad situation. TREASON means long jail sentences, and this was TREASON!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter Friday morning. In two separate interviews, Barr maintained that illegal spying did take place, a claim he made in Senate testimony last month. In a conversation with Fox News' Bill Hemmer on \"America's Newsroom,\" Barr suggested that he wanted to get to the bottom of whether \"government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale\" during the Russia investigation. He criticized unnamed officials as providing \"inadequate\" explanations for what took place. In a separate interview with the Wall Street Journal, Barr appeared more certain, asserting, \"Government power was used to spy on American citizens.\" The attorney general's assertion of spying, however, has been twice denied by current and former FBI officials. When asked directly about Barr's claims before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray\u00a0testified to the Senate Appropriations Committee\u00a0that he wasn't aware of any illegal \"spying\" on the Trump campaign in 2016. Former FBI Director James Comey also maintained that he had \"no idea\" what Barr was talking about when he brought up the claim of unauthorized spying.\u00a0 On Thursday, Mr. Trump introduced his plan to prioritize high-skilled immigrants and restrict family-based migration a proposal that would drastically change the composition of immigrants to the U.S. However, the president's plan won't include any protections for undocumented immigrants who arrived as children. It's unclear if a single Democrat has been consulted on the plan so far, and some Republicans have offered tepid responses to the proposal. Asked Wednesday how failing to first confer with Democrats or include anything on so-called \"Dreamers\" amounts to anything more than a reelection strategy, the official said, \"If they don't want to engage then it would be part of the election. If they want to engage, it could be part of the negotiation. That's going to be up to them.\" Kathryn Watson, Emily Tillett and Grace Segers contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "President Trump again threatened to close \"large portions\" of the southern border on Friday if Mexico does not halt all undocumented immigrants from entering the country. This comes after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen sent a letter to Congress with an \"urgent request\" for assistance ahead of a \"system-wide meltdown\" the agency faces due to a tide of migrants overwhelming the border. Also this week, Democratic lawmakers are calling for the full release of the Mueller report, which is more than 300 pages long. Speaker Pelosi criticized Attorney General William Barr's summary of the report as \"condescending\" and \"arrogant\" and said \"it wasn't the right thing to do.\" Seeking to alleviate those concerns, Barr sent a letter Friday to lawmakers saying the Justice Department will deliver the special counsel's report by mid-April, with parts redacted. He also offered to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on May 1 and 2.  House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who has led the committee's own investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, is now facing calls from Republican colleagues to resign as chairman for pushing a \"false narrative\" of collusion. And President Trump reopened a fight over Obamacare that many believed, including some congressional Republicans, he already lost. Vowing to make health care a centerpiece of his reelection campaign, the president tweeted, The Republican Party will become \"The Party of Healthcare!\" The Republican Party will become \u201cThe Party of Healthcare!\u201d This comes as the Justice Department shifted legal positions this week and argued the entire Affordable Care Act should be invalidated.  However, the president faced another legal defeat on the issue Thursday when a federal judge struck down the administration's push to allow health insurance plans outside the ACA that avoid the law's coverage requirements. The president announced he asked a small group of Republican senators \"to take a look, form a really great plan,\" including Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott. The issue of health care is again emerging at the center of the 2020 Democratic platform. Most candidates have embraced the idea of universal health care, most notably Vermont Independent Sen.

            "article_content": "Our series A More Perfect Union aims to show that what unites us as Americans is far greater than what divides us. In this installment, we go to a state where Republicans and Democrats are working together to welcome refugees.\u00a0 President Donald Trump has sharply reduced the number of refugees who can legally enter the United States. Next year, the cap will be 18,000, the lowest since Congress established the Refugee Resettlement Program in 1980. The U.S. resettled nearly 85,000 refugees in 2016. But in heavily Republican Utah, officials have watched the decline in refugee resettlements with alarm and they have a message for Mr. Trump: send us more, not fewer, refugees, reports CBS News correspondent Major Garrett. Asma Dahir was born in Utah after her mother fled a Kenyan refugee camp with her three kids in 1998. A raging civil war had forced them from their home in Somalia. \"My mom was pregnant with me and my twin sister,\" Dahir said. \"I would say Utah is the best thing that happened to our family because since we resettled here, we've had countless of opportunities.\" Utah is a largely conservative state, but it's also one of the most refugee friendly. Until Mr. Trump's election, it welcomed upwards of 1,500 refugees per year. Those numbers are down by two-thirds now. Jackie Biskupski, the Democratic mayor of Salt Lake, and Michelle Kaufusi, Republican mayor of Provo, disagree on some issues but not this one. \"The refugee piece is really tender and personal to us and it's an issue of the heart for us in Provo City,\" Kaufusi said. \"We are a very red state,\" Biskupski said. \"But we all agree that Utah should be a welcoming state for refugees.\" \"Issues like this are bigger than our partisans and our parties,\" Kaufusi added. In October, Mr. Trump boasted about a new executive order. \"No refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the expressed written consent of that city or that state,\" he said. Weeks later, Utah's Republican Governor Gary Herbert sent his reply in a letter. \"I encourage you to allow us to accept more international refugees in Utah,\" he wrote. Utah's Republican House Speaker Brad Wilson, who supports Mr. Trump and, like the governor, is Mormon, said the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints sustains the state's commitment to refugee resettlement. \"I can tell you here in Utah, this has never been a partisan issue. \u2026 Our state was settled by individuals that were fleeing religious persecution,\" he said. \"I think it's just kind of in our DNA.\" \"Has Utah ever felt overrun by refugees?\" Garrett asked. \"Not that I'm aware of,\" Wilson said.\u00a0 Haymar Janumonya arrived in Utah in 2008. She fled violence in Burma for Thailand when she was 13. She made the journey on foot, she said.\u00a0 \"I have to get to Thailand. We walking,\" she said.\u00a0 Janumonya became a U.S. citizen in 2013 and, helped by the Spice Kitchen Incubator, a program run by the International Rescue Committee for immigrants and refugees interested in starting a food business, she now owns her own Burmese-Thai restaurant. \"We're not trying to bring refugees here to take on our low-wage paying jobs either. We are putting them on career paths,\" Biskupski said. \"They are some of the most hardworking, dedicated people you'll ever meet \u2026 and that's what I would hope that President Trump would see,\" Kaufusi said. The mayors also hope Mr. Trump would see what Dahir is doing now. She's a public health major at Westminster College in Salt Lake City and plans to become a physician assistant. And she volunteers with newly arrived refugees, hoping to pay forward the opportunities she's had. \"I feel like it's a cycle where younger folks who were raised in Utah have the ability to become successful and then they want to reciprocate that with future generations,\" Dahir said.  States and local communities have until Christmas Day to tell the federal government whether they plan to continue welcoming refugees.",

            "article_content": "Hundreds of refugees have crossed into Uganda from Congo in the days since that country's troubled presidential election, a Red Cross official said Wednesday, heightening concerns about the possible cross-border spread of Ebola. Separately, the head of the World Health Organization said he has asked the supplier of an experimental vaccine to produce more of it. The refugee influx started the day after Sunday's vote and since then dozens of people have been arriving at a time, said Irene Nakasiita, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Uganda. Some Congolese trying to cross the border were forced back after resisting the efforts of Ugandan health officials screening people for Ebola, she said. Gayle Smith, president and CEO of the anti-poverty group The ONE Campaign, had expressed concern about the virus spreading beyond Congo on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" in an interview broadcast Sunday. \"I'm quite concerned that it hasn't risen to a higher level of attention on the world's agenda because as we know these viruses don't pay attention to borders, and they move very quickly,\" she said. \"It could kill a whole lot more people.\" Congo's government cited the Ebola outbreak in the country's northeast for a contentious decision to bar an estimated 1 million voters from the election. Protests followed, with some people vandalizing Ebola response facilities and some aid groups forced to suspend work for days. The internet has been cut off in Congo this week in an apparent effort by the government to prevent social media speculation about the results, while the opposition and observers have reported multiple problems with the election. The internet outage also has affected Ebola response efforts, with Congo's health ministry on Wednesday citing \"technical problems\" for the delay in sending its daily update on the outbreak. More than 600 Ebola cases have been reported, with more than 360 confirmed deaths since August. The outbreak is the second-deadliest in history. The outbreak has been difficult to control amid armed violence and community protests, and the violence has increased \"in intensity and frequency,\" the head of the World Health Organization said Wednesday. And yet \"there is reason to be hopeful\" the outbreak will be brought under control as soon as possible, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. Tedros spent New Year's Day in Congo. Amid the election-related protests last week, he warned that \"prolonged insecurity\" in Congo could lead to a rise in new Ebola cases. Some of the Ebola cases in this outbreak have been reported close to the heavily traveled border with Uganda. For months, Ugandan officials have been subjecting all passing through official border posts to mandatory Ebola screening. The Ebola virus is spread through direct contact with the fluids of an infected person. More than 50,000 people have received an experimental vaccine. Tedros said there were enough doses of the vaccine available \"but at the same time we have already requested the supplier to produce more.\"",

            "article_content": "Ankara, Turkey \u2014Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted Tuesday that re-running the Istanbul mayoral vote that was won by the opposition will only strengthen democracy, while critics called the decision an \"outrageous\" move to eliminate dissent against his government. Ruling in favor of Erdogan's governing party, Turkey's top electoral body on Monday annulled the results of the March 31 vote in Istanbul, which opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu narrowly won, and scheduled a re-run for June 23. The loss of Istanbul \u2014 and the capital of Ankara \u2014 in Turkey's local elections were sharp blows to Erdogan and his conservative, Islamic-based Justice and Development Party, or AKP. AKP had challenged the results of the vote, claiming it was marred by irregularities. Critics accuse the AKP of trying to cling to power in Istanbul, a city of 15 million people that is Turkey's cultural and commercial hub, and of exerting heavy pressure on the country's electoral body to cancel the outcome of the March 31 vote. The controversial decision has increased concerns over democracy and the rule of law in Turkey, a NATO member that is still formally a candidate to join the European Union. Turkey is also a key Western ally in the fight against terrorism and in stemming the flow of refugees to Europe. \"The will of the people has been trampled on,\" said Meral Aksener, leader of a nationalist party in Turkey that had backed Imamoglu. The move is raising questions about whether Erdogan, who has consolidated power throughout his 16-year rule and is increasingly accused of authoritarianism, would ever accept any electoral defeat or relinquish power. \"This outrageous decision highlights how Erdogan's Turkey is drifting toward a dictatorship,\" Guy Verhofstadt, a European Parliament lawmaker and the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, said on Twitter. \"Under such leadership, accession talks are impossible.\" Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, described the decision as a \"seismic event in Turkish history.\" \"Turkey has been holding free and fair elections since the 1950s,\" he told The Associated Press. \"Never before has a party refused to accept the outcome of the election... This goes against 70 years of accepted tradition.\" \u2033(Erdogan) is saying 'let's vote until the governing party wins,\" he added. Opposition newspaper Birgun branded the decision a \"coup\" and argued that justice in Turkey had \"been suspended.\" The redo of the Istanbul vote also threatens to further de-stabilize the Turkish economy, which has entered a recession. The Turkish lira crashed spectacularly last summer over investor concerns about Erdogan's policies. It has been sliding again in recent weeks and on Tuesday it hit its lowest level since October. Europe's top human rights and democracy watchdog expressed concerns about reports of pressure exerted by Erdogan's government on the electoral body. \"We face the repeat elections in Istanbul with great concern and urge Turkish authorities to do their utmost to restore the safeguards of the electoral process,\" said Anders Knape, the President of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. Delivering a speech in Parliament on Tuesday, Erdogan reiterated that the vote was sullied by irregularities \"we could not ignore.\" He rejected opposition accusations that his party was trying to win back a key election that it had lost. He said violations included the alleged improper entering of election data and the fact that thousands of officials overseeing the vote at ballot stations were bankers or teachers and not civil servants, as required by law. \"We see this decision as an important step in strengthening our democracy, which will enable the removal of the shadow cast over the Istanbul election,\" Erdogan said. The opposition, however, has complained about irregularities at Turkish elections in the past years, but their objections have been ignored. Imamoglu arrived in Ankara on Tuesday for emergency talks with senior members of the opposition Republican Peoples' Party, or CHP. Despite media reports about a possible boycott of the repeated vote in Istanbul, CHP made clear that Imamoglu would run again. \"We extend our hand to all our citizens,\" the party said at the end of the meeting. \"We wholeheartedly believe that this extended hand will be held strong on 23 June, that it will strengthen our democratic struggle and that we will achieve a greater victory than on March 31.\" On the other side, Erdogan told reporters that former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim would again run as the ruling party's candidate for mayor. On Tuesday, the Interior Ministry appointed Istanbul's governor Ali Yerlikaya as acting mayor of the city. The Istanbul municipality immediately deleted all tweets that were posted by Imamoglu during his 20 days in office as mayor.",

Omar told reporters at the airport that it felt \"good to be home,\" and she retweeted video of her arrival and wrote \"home sweet home!!\" Home sweet home!! https://t.co/OQvh52aw2Q There was security at the town hall, which was mostly full, according to CBS Minnesota. Omar received a standing ovation when she got on stage.\u00a0 \"I know there are a lot of people that are trying to distract us now, but I want you all to know that we are not going to lie down,\" Omar told the crowd.\u00a0 Omar, a supporter of Medicare for all, called the health care system \"broken.\"\u00a0 \"Here is what medicare for all means in real terms,\" Omar said. \"High-quality healthcare for all U.S. residents. Comprehensive coverage including dental, vision, and long-term care. No co-pays, deductibles, or other cost sharing. Substantial administrative savings through global budgeting of hospitals and a more efficient healthcare system by cutting out private insurance company middlemen.\" Rose Roach, the executive director of the Minnesota Nurses Association, told Omar \"we are so grateful for all the amazing things you do in Congress and we stand with you.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump's name was not mentioned at the town hall. Many town hall attendees told CBS Minnesota they had planned to attend already to hear about Omar's plans about Medicare For All, but they said they also wanted to come to show their support for Omar.\u00a0 Omar, who was first elected to Congress in November, is one of four progressive freshmen congresswomen of color known as \"The Squad,\" who first publicly disagreed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi by refusing to vote for a $4.6 billion border bill. But the internal Democratic Party fight turned on Sunday when\u00a0Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter the four women should \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested\u00a0places from which they came.\" Omar, a Somali refugee who became a naturalized American citizen, is the only one of the four women who was not born in the U.S. At a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Mr. Trump singled her out, falsely claiming she blamed the U.S. for terrorist attacks. The crowd responded with chants of \"send her back.\"\u00a0 After Mr. Trump and the crowd were widely criticized, Mr. Trump claimed Thursday he was \"not happy\" with the chant, although he did nothing to stop it during the rally. CBS News has learned that the president took heat\u00a0from first lady Melania Trump and his daughter Ivanka over the racist chants. He also heard from Vice President Mike Pence. Omar's immediate response Wednesday night was with a pair of tweets, first writing, \"I am where I belong, at the people's house, and you're just gonna have to deal!\" She then tweeted a Maya Angelou poem that read: \"You may shoot me with your words / You may cut me with your eyes / You may kill me with your hatefulness / But still, like air, I'll rise.\"   Omar told reporters Thursday that immigrants like her are as American as everyone else in the country, CBS Minnesota\u00a0reported. \"We are where we belong,\" she said. \"I told people on my election night, in the great state of Minnesota, we don't just welcome refugees, we send them to represent us in Washington. As much as [Trump is] spewing his fascist ideology on stage, telling you as citizens to go back because they don't agree with his detrimental policies for our country, we tell people that here in the U.S the sense is patriotic, here in the U.S. disagreement is welcome, debate is welcome, and especially in the people's house, all of our voices are uplifted.\"",

Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar \u2014 three of the Democratic members of Congress competing for the party's presidential nomination \u2014 are joining forces to call on the Trump administration to overhaul the policies in place for detaining and housing unaccompanied migrant children in U.S. custody. \u00a0 In a letter to the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) on Tuesday, the trio of 2020 Democrats urged the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure its facilities have proper oversight and to evaluate and change its policies regarding the care of unaccompanied minors, who are supposed to be transferred to HHS within three days of their apprehension by Border Patrol. Citing thousands of sexual abuse allegations\u00a0reported by children in HHS custody, Harris, Gillibrand and Klobuchar said the changes are urgent.\u00a0 \"We cannot compromise on the safety and wellbeing of children facing extended lengths of stay in government custody,\" the senators wrote in their letter. ORR is the agency within HHS responsible for taking care of unaccompanied migrant children in U.S. custody. \u00a0\u00a0 The senators \u2014 who visited the largest shelter for unaccompanied migrant children at Homestead, Florida, last week alongside other presidential candidates \u2014 noted that HHS has received the funding it requested for months.\u00a0 Congress last week approved a multi-billion-dollar funding package the Trump administration requested to deal with the months-long unprecedented surge of Central American families and unaccompanied minors heading towards the U.S.-Mexico border. A version of the legislation with stronger protections for migrant children in U.S. custody favored by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and progressives was derailed in the House after a group of moderates threatened to revolt.\u00a0 \"ORR should be prioritizing reunification of every child as soon as possible, but instead it has been responsible for policies that are forcing longer stays in government custody for children,\" Harris, Gillibrand and Klobuchar wrote in their letter. \"You now have the funding you said you needed, and your office must ensure that the custody and processing of UACs is meeting the minimum standards required by domestic and international law.\" Accusing some HHS shelters, which are typically operated by private contractors, of violating the Flores court settlement that governs the care of migrant children in U.S. custody, the three senators called on HHS to ensure that the companies it hires employ staff who go through proper vetting and that have adequate resources to take care of children.\u00a0 Harris, Gillibrand and Klobuchar said these shelters need to have rigorous oversight to make sure they are abiding by the Flores agreement and other state requirements for the care of minors.\u00a0 Although most of the shelters which house migrant children are subject to inspections by state child welfare authorities, some \"temporary\" ones \u2014 like the\u00a0one in Homestead, Florida\u00a0\u2014 are not required do undergo inspections since they are located on federal land.\u00a0 This week, HHS opened a new \"temporary influx shelter\" in Carrizo Springs, Texas, on a site that was once used as a private dormitory \"man camp\" for oil field workers. HHS is also slated to start using an Army base in Oklahoma as one of these temporary shelters for unaccompanied migrant children in its custody.\u00a0 The three senators said HHS should not open up any new of these \"temporary influx\" facilities. \"I urge you to ensure these 'temporary' shelters remain temporary and are beholden to stringent compliance requirements for state-licensing as they become operationalized,\" they wrote. \"ORR must not establish or expand Influx Care Facilities that are not state-licensed\u00a0or\u00a0Flores-compliant without stringent compliance oversight.\"\u00a0 Graham Kates contributed to this report.

Great to be with you. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Tony, you have a particularly interesting story about how you came to be interested in foreign policy. Can you share that with us? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Yes. You know, I think we're all sort of products of the conversations we hear around the dining room table, the kitchen table in our families. And in my family, a lot of the stories were about the fact that so many of the people that came before me were refugees or immigrants of one kind or another. I had a grandfather who came here at the turn of the last century fleeing pilgrims in what's now Ukraine, was welcome to the United States, built a life for himself, for his children, a stepmother who fled communism, literally, in the dead of night on a train, made her way, at a very young age with her mother, to the United States. She, too, was welcome here. And, then, finally, my stepfather who passed away a few years ago, he was one of 900 children in his school in Bialystok, Poland before World War II, the only one of those 900 to survive. His entire immediate family was wiped. Bialystok was the center of Jewish living in Poland. He wound up in virtually all of the concentration camps one can remember from history, Auschwitz, Dachau, Majdanek. At the very end of the war, he made a run for it. They were on a death march out of one of the camps in Bavaria. And he made a run for it with some of his friends. And somehow, they made it into the woods. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: How old was he at the time? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: At this point, he was 16. So he was in the camps from age 12 to 16. And somehow, they made it to the woods. And they hid out during the day and moved around at night. And after a few days of this, one day, they heard this rumbling sound. And as he looked out from their hiding place, what he saw was a tank. But instead of having the dreaded iron cross or a swastika on it, he saw something else. He saw a five-pointed white star. And in a kind of crazy way, he ran to the tank. And the hatch opened up. And an African American GI looked down at him. And he got down on his knees. And he said the only three words that he knew in English that his mother had taught him before the war, \"God bless America.\" And at that point, the GI lifted him into the tank into freedom, in effect, into the United States. That was kind of the image that I had of my country growing up, what it represented to people around the world. And I think that's what motivated me as much as anything else to get into foreign policy. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So I don't want to jump too far ahead. But what we're seeing in our country now with the feelings about immigrants and refugees must cut to the core with you. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: It does. And, you know, on the one hand, look, I think we all get it. People feel a tremendous sense of confusion right now and chaos and a loss of identity. They don't recognize themselves. They don't recognize the country. And it's deeply, deeply, deeply confusing. At the same time, we know from our own history that we've gone through successive waves of migration each of which has made the country stronger but each of which, at different points in history, had a counterweight whether it was Irish, whether it was Italians, whether it was Jews, whether it was Asians, whether it's Latinos. And we know that this is incredibly disruptive. And it takes some time to sort it all out. Each time, it's made the country stronger. But during these periods of transition, it's tough. And we have to find a way forward that works for all of our communities as well as working for the people that want to come here. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So in those previous moments of backlash, how did we emerge from them? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: You know, in these previous moments, there was a transition period. And it was challenging. And I don't want to minimize the disruptions that took place. But there was a recognition the economy might improve as we saw success, as we saw what immigrants were bringing to the country. There was a recognition that this made sense for America. Now, when we look across the broad swath of the economy, look at every pursuit. Who are the folks who are picking our crops? Who are the folks serving food at our tables, cleaning our homes and, then, as you move up the ladder, nursing the sick in underserved communities, doctoring them and, then, at the highest end, half of our fortune 500 companies foundered or co-foundered by immigrants or the sons and daughters of immigrants, half of the startups in Silicon Valley, the same thing. So we see the success time and time again. But now, in this particular moment, these disruptive forces are more intense and more acute than they've been. And you get a feeling things are just moving in fast motion. And it's very hard for people to be grounded and have a sense that they're going to come out okay on the other side. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So with this historical understanding, are you confident that we're going to come out the other end here? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Look, this could be the exception that breaks the rule. It's hard to be fully confident. You know, I'm reminded of the late John McCain who said, \"It's always darkest before it goes completely black.\" But all of that said, I don't believe that. I think that most of us have a sense of optimism based on our history because we've been through incredibly tough periods before. The 1960s, to take a recent example, the late 1960s were far more disruptive than the period that we're going through now. The dawn of the progressive era, to me, this is maybe most closely approximate to that. We had, before the progressive era, capitalism fully unleashed in this country producing tremendous wealth and, in many ways, tremendous progress but also in a way that was not evenly distributed, that was leaving too many people out, too many people behind. And thankfully, we had a progressive era in which the rough edges of capitalism were rounded off. More people were brought into the mix. We made major investments in education, in healthcare, in infrastructure, progressive taxation. Now, in a sense, we need a progressive era but on a global scale. That's really the change of the moment to figure out how we can take these incredible forces that are at play, bringing tremendous advantages globalization, but in way that doesn't leave too many people out of the deal. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So I heard Warren Buffet say not long ago, you know how there's things that people say that stay with you for the rest of your life, this was one of those moments, he said, \"I believe that capitalism was the greatest force for good in the history of mankind,\" which I believe, too. And, then, he said, \"But I fear we're going to lose it unless we take care of the people that it leaves behind.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: I couldn't agree more. There is a crisis of legitimacy for capitalism that we're going through now. And, again, we've been through it before. This is what happened before the progressive era. It happened before the New Deal. And in a sense, it's happening now but, again, on a global scale. And we figured out how to get through these periods before. Now, could this be different? Absolutely. At each big transformation there was a transitional period. And somehow, we wound up on the other side in a better place. That may still happen. But you still have to get to the other side. And that's the challenge we're in now. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Okay. Then, the impact of all of this on our foreign policy and our role in the world, how do you think about that? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Well, I think there's increasingly recognition that whatever foreign policy we pursue, it actually has to work for people here at home. And if it doesn't, then, it's going to be very difficult to sustain it. And so, for example, if we have a foreign trade policy, an economic policy that's not also working to materially improve the lives of the people here, it's not going to be sustained. If we have a foreign policy that people perceive is somehow getting us into problems that we shouldn't be involved in, that may be difficult to sustain as well. So being clear with our fellow citizens explaining what we're doing, why we're doing it, what the objectives are, how it's going to actually make their lives better is usually important. But, Mike, I'd say another thing, we shouldn't be a prisoner to history. But we should at least be informed by it. And I think the period after World War II was hugely instructive and remains very instructive because that was a period in time when, after the war, we could've retreated as we did after World War I. We could've pulled back. Or we could've used the tremendous power that we had to, basically, lord it over others. And we didn't do either of those things. Famously, we spent time building the institutions, developing the norms, the rules that others live by but also ourselves. And that seemed counterintuitive. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: And spending a tremendous amount of money rebuilding our enemies. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Absolutely. But here's what we got out of it, we did, we invested in their prosperity. We invested in their security. But we got new markets for our products. We got new partners to deal with global challenges. We got new allies to deter aggression. Those investments, we got ten, 20, 100 times over in return. And that's why, as we think about today, we shouldn't be blind to what we did in the past because it does hold lessons. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So, Tony, one of the things that I worry about is that we national security folk, foreign policy folk, have a hard time articulating for the average American why America's role in the world is so important to them. I mean, I've been places in the country where people say to me, \"Mr. Morell, why does it matter what Vladimir Putin does in Ukraine? Or why does it matter what the Chinese do in the South China Sea? How does that affect me?\" How do you answer that question? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: You know, I spent about 25 years in government. And one of the things I took away is this, the world doesn't govern itself. And over the past 70-plus years, the United States has played a lead role in helping to govern the world, again, establishing the institutions but also defending them, helping to put in place the rules and the norms. And we know this, if we're not doing it, if we're not playing a lead role, then, one of two things: either someone else will and probably not in a way that advances our interests and values or even worse, perhaps, no one does. And, then, the forces of anarchy and chaos prevail. And in the past when that's happened, that's created big global conflagrations World War I, World War II. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Which we get sucked into. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Which we get sucked into. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Pay now or pay later. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: It's pay now or pay a lot more later. And the other thing I'd say is this, we have extraordinary resources in this country. And with those resources, with that wealth, with that success I think comes a certain amount of responsibility to at least do our part in advancing the common good. But it's also something called enlightened self-interest. Yes, it's doing right by others. But, ultimately, that does well by us. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Okay. Let's do an around the world kind of hotspots approach. And as we do these, Tony, I would ask you to kind of assess the situation, assess the Trump administration's approach to that issue. And if you disagree with it, say what would you recommend to the president instead. Okay. So let's start with Saudi Arabia. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Saudi Arabia, I think the administration has missed a tremendous opportunity to use a horrific, terrible event, the murder of this journalist, Khashoggi, to use that as a way to influence Saudi behavior and Saudi policies in a way that better reflect our interests and our values. There was a moment to go to Saudi Arabia and say a few things. One, your new leader or de facto leader, the crown prince, acts in impulsive and sometimes reckless ways. We're not telling you who should lead your country. But we are telling you he needs to be reined in in some fashion. You choose how. Second, this horrific war in Yemen that is doing extraordinary damage to tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of innocent civilians, that needs to end. You need to actually take the first step in helping to end it. We're here to defend you. We will defend you from any aggression by the Houthis in Yemen. But you need to take steps to end this war. And we won't be complicit in it anymore. Third, this crazy division with Qatar, that needs to end. You need to resolve it. And you also need to demonstrate to the world that the things you're talking about in terms of liberalizing your country you mean. And that means letting people who've been simply trying to advance and advocate for their rights out of jail. There was a moment to do all of that. That moment seems to have been squandered. Saudi Arabia seems to have a blank check. This is not about ending the alliance or the partnership with Saudi Arabia. It is making sure that the alliance actually reflects our interests and our values not just Saudi Arabia's. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Your view on the likelihood that Mohammad Bin Salman is going to change, because, I mean, there's been such a pattern here of reckless behavior. Right? And it seems to flow from both an arrogance and a paranoia. And people who have paranoia, as they get older, it tends not to go away. So I'm really wondering here about how likely he is to change, ultimately. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Look, I'm skeptical, which is why I think Saudi Arabia needs a governor on his impulsiveness and his recklessness of their choice -- whether it's a regent, whether it's a council, something. But look, he is whatever he is, 33, 34 now. I don't want to rule that out either. You know, I met him when he was 29. He had just become defense minister. And this was just after the Houthi aggression taking over Sana'a and Yemen and then, moving on the rest of the country. And then, the Saudis and the emirates intervened with our backing. And I was dispatched to Saudi Arabia to say two things. One was to make it clear that we were committed to Saudi Arabia's defense if they were attacked in any way by the Houthis, we would be there. But two was to ask them, 'What are you trying to accomplish in Yemen? What's the strategic objective?' And the answer I got from Mohammad Bin Salman in the meeting with him was, immediately, 'To remove every last vestige or Iranian influence in Yemen,' to which I responded, 'Good luck, not going to happen.' My hope is that with experience, including the experience of what he has brought on himself through this horrific, horrific action and murder of a journalist, that if he's going to remain around, that he learns something from it. But the jury's out. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: We'll see. Just across the Persian Gulf, Iran. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Look, I think the irony with Iran is that we have a lot of problems and challenges posed by Iran including its support for terrorism, including its meddling in various countries in the region, including, of course, its abysmal record at home on human rights. The irony is this: the one thing we got right, actually curbing its nuclear weapons program and putting a check on it, is the one thing we just tore up -- which makes no sense. And now, it actually makes it more difficult to deal with the other challenges posed by Iran. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Why more difficult? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Two reasons, first, I think the reason the Obama administration focused like a laser on trying to deal with the problem that was an urgent problem, which was Iran having the capacity to move to a nuclear weapon very, very quickly, to have the capacity to have enough fissile material on very short order to build a weapon was urgent, because of the immediate threat that that would pose if they actually developed a weapon -- but also because it would allow them to act with even greater impunity in these other areas where they posed a threat to our interests and to what we were trying to achieve in the region. Now, I think we have the worst of both worlds. Iran, for the time being, continues to abide by its obligations under the deal. It's trying to see if it can get the economic benefits it bargained for from Europe and from other countries. And we'll see if that's sustainable.  What I worry about it this, given the administration's efforts to squeeze Iran economically and to use the leverage that we have with our economy to force other countries to abandon any kind of economic relationship with Iran, at some point, those in Iran who are against the nuclear deal from the beginning will reassert themselves and say, \"We're no longer abiding by our obligations.\" And, then, Mike, we'll be right back where we were before we got into the deal which is Iran on the threshold of having enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon. And we'll be faced with the binary choice that we tried to avoid. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Right. Right. And we're sending a signal, a very strong signal, whether it's the policy or not, I don't know. But we're sending a signal that we're all about regime change. And if you're the Iranians, why would you ever negotiate with people who want you to go away? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: That's right. That's right. The idea that Iran is now going to do more and get less under duress doesn't make any sense. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Afghanistan -- we've been there for 17 years. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: This is one of the toughest problems and I think one of the most enduring frustrations that I've had. And I have to acknowledge here that I actually think President Trump's instincts are probably right on this, which is, it's time. It's time to cut the cord. And this goes against a lot of, I think, instincts that a lot of us have because we know what the Taliban regime meant to the people of Afghanistan -- and not in a good way. We know that real progress has been made in improving the lives of people in Afghanistan. At the same time, the position we're in is not sustainable. And where I'm particularly frustrated is this --and you'll remember this well -- virtually every year, we would hear from our colleagues, \"We just need one more year, just one more year. And it will be self-sustaining. The Afghans will be able to fend for themselves. \"The military will be able to control the security situation along with the police.\" And year after year, it was just one more year. I think our finger's been in the dyke in Afghanistan for a long time. I, obviously, worry what will happen when we take it out. But I also think that, at this point, it's just not sustainable. And we also have to remember why we were there in first place. As much as one can appreciate some of the successes that the international community had in improving the lives of Afghans, the bottom-line, hard reality is that we were there because of 9/11 and because of Al Qaeda. And that threat has been, if not eliminated, significantly reduced to the point where I think it can be contained without having 15,000 Americans in Afghanistan. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: I mean, one of the ways I think about it is to ask if we weren't there now, would we go? And the answer to that is no. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: I think you've got it right. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Absolutely. Russia, Putin's aggression on a number of fronts, right, whether it's with his neighbors, whether it's what he's doing in Syria, whether it's what he is doing in terms of weaponizing social media, a whole bunch of issues. How do we deal with that? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Putin is playing a losing hand brilliantly. Russia, by virtually every metric, is actually in decline. And, yet, he succeeded in reasserting Russia on the world stage, to some extent to distract from problems at home, to some extent to try to realize a vision that he has of a greater Russia, but mostly I think for this reason -- the biggest threat to Putin's continued leadership in Russia is really the success of democracy. And that's true, by the way, for just about any autocrat. And he has a profound strategic interest in trying to demonstrate to his own people that democracies are failing, that our system is no better than his. It's not delivering better results. To the contrary, it's chaotic, not stable. And so, unfortunately, whether we like it or not and even if we pull back and didn't engage Russian aggression, I believe he would continue to try to create trouble in Europe, in the United States, within our societies and between them. So this is a huge challenge for us. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: How do we engage him in a way that makes this much better? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: A few things. First of all, let's take Ukraine and let's take Russian aggression with regard to some of its neighbors. First, I think it's a good thing that we expanded NATO. There's a big argument over whether NATO expansion actually has provoked Russian behavior. I asked myself where would the Baltic states be right now if they were not in NATO? Where would Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic be in their own ways? I think that's proved to be a tremendous deterrent to Russian aggression. But states like Ukraine that are not in it, there's a reason that we got involved in leading the effort to put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression, and, we hope, actually return sovereignty to Ukraine. And it's not because on a basic level Ukraine, itself, is that critical to the United States or to countries in Europe. It's because the norms that were violated in terms of aggressing a democratic country on Russia's borders, changing its borders by force, trying to dictate to people their choices about with whom they would ally or associate, if you allow that to stand, it is an open invitation to aggression and anarchy throughout the world. So we have to stand up against that. And I think sustaining that is important. And we've sustained it. And the Trump administration, despite what the president says, the administration, itself, has sustained it. But at home, we have to do a much better job, of course, at defending our democratic institutions from the kind of meddling not only in the elections in 2016 but everything that's followed since. And I think we've got a couple of big challenges there. First, we're not properly defended. Second, we don't have a clear and effective deterrence policy. We need to actually be very clear about what we'll actually do if we're attacked, and mean it and actually do it. And, then, we probably have to look at how we would use these tools ourselves, and also what the right responses would be. And they may well be asymmetric, responding tit for tat, for example, against some kind of cyber-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: The problem, of course, is that politics has got in the middle of this issue, right, and has not allowed the discussion that you want to have on this to actually occur. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: This should've been a unifying issue. This should've brought people together because the attack is not on Democrats or on Republicans or anyone else. It's on our democracy. And that's the one thing that should unite us. And, unfortunately, that's what we're losing right now. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: North Korea. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: So on North Korea, look, I think that there was some merit in President Trump throwing the deck of cards up in the air and seeing what came from it, because the fact of the matter is the policy that successive administrations have pursued over the last decades has not worked. North Korea's gotten more dangerous, not less dangerous. Its arsenal has gotten bigger, not smaller. And so, at some point, you say, \"Maybe it's worth trying something new.\" And I don't object to direct diplomacy even with someone as heinous Kim Jong Un. But, unfortunately, thus far at least, the art of the deal has really been the art of the steal and all in North Korea's favor. I think the president in having the meeting with Kim Jong Un gave Kim Jong Un something that he deeply, deeply valued and that none of his predecessors were able to get. And that was the legitimacy that comes from meeting with the leader of the free world being on the same stage. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: That was the questioned they always asked, he and his father, \"When can I meet with the president? When can I meet with the president?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: So President Trump would say, \"See, I did something that no previous president did.\" Well, there was a good reason that previous presidents didn't do it. Or if you're going to do it, at least make sure you're getting something. And, unfortunately, thus far at least, we haven't. North Korea's program has continued. We continue to see reports in the press from our intelligence agencies and others showing that far from pulling back, they're moving forward. At the same time in elevating Kim Jong Un, in declaring success and even saying, at one point, that the nuclear problem was resolved, the president gave a green light to other countries, starting with China, to go back to something approaching business as usual. What had been working and where the administration deserves credit was it not only continued, but it actually deepened the pressure program that the Obama administration put in place to cut off every economic tie that North Korea had, diplomatic ties, political ties. And that was starting to have an effect.  China, of course, is a key to that. Now, the president has, basically, said to China, \"Hey, if the problem's resolved, why should China have to continue doing this?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: The Chinese, the Russians and the South Koreans have all loosened up. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: That's exactly right. That's exactly right. You know, again, I give him some points for trying a different playbook, the way he's played it, I think, is making things worse, not better. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: How would you fix that? I mean, if you could say to Mike Pompeo, \"Here's what I think you need to do?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Look, I think we were on the right track. And we need to figure out a way to get back to it, which was a sustained pressure campaign that's internationally coordinated but that has an objective not of regime change but conduct change. The hard reality is it's, if not impossible, highly unlikely that we will achieve in any near term the complete denuclearization of North Korea. I just don't see that as realistic in the near term.  What I think we can get is an arms control and, over time, disarmament process put in place. But that requires enough pressure, sustained and comprehensive to get North Korea to the table. And that requires China. It requires South Korea. It requires Russia. It requires others. It's doable. But it takes time. It has to be sustained. And it has to be comprehensive. So there's a play there. But we haven't seen signs of the administration being willing to do it. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Okay. The toughest one of all, China. Right. What should our strategic approach to China be? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: We had an approach for decades that sought to bring China more and more into the international system starting with the international economy on theory that this would actually liberalize China at the same time. And thus far, at least, that theory has not borne out. Now, history is long -- especially Chinese history. So maybe we're assessing the situation too soon. But clearly, the consensus that had developed over the right approach, the responsible stakeholder approach right now, at least, is in serious doubt. But I still think the basics of what we were trying to do, which was work to cooperate with China where we can, compete with it where we must but compete in a way that has a level playing field and basic fairness, is still the right approach. But now, we're stuck in a different dynamic. And that is a veering wildly between confrontation on the one hand and abdication on the other hand. So on the one hand, a very confrontational approach over trade and related issues which is not wrong in the sense that the lack of reciprocity in the commercial relationship was totally un-sustained. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: These are real issues. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: These are real issues. The president was right to confront the issue, I think profoundly wrong in the way he's doing it; throwing out the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a huge strategic mistake. This was our best lever to change Chinese behavior. 40% of world GDP with us in it represented, something that China would want to get into, not stay out of, that's gone. Not making common cause with our allies who are similarly situated when it comes to China, who are aggrieved in the same way with technology transfer, the theft of intellectual property, the lack of transparency, unfair competition from state-owned enterprises. We should've been on the same team with them. Instead, of course, starting a tariff war against our closest partners has made that more difficult. But that needs to be dealt with. But I think that as we're doing that, we can't abdicate our leadership in the region. And, again, out of TPP is an abdication of our leadership. Telling our allies, 'You know what, you're going to be on your own. We don't want to pay for this anymore,' that's an abdication of leadership. And if there's a vacuum, look, what have we seen? A profound irony. We've seen Xi Jinping try to assert himself as a leader of the global community who is in favor of a free and open trading system, who supports globalization, who supports the United Nations, peacekeeping, whose voting shares are increasing in the international financial institutions at the same time when we're pulling back from all of that. And that means that, again, in the absence of American leadership, in the absence of an American model, a Chinese model could win by default not because it's better. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So one of the two outcomes you talked about earlier. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Exactly. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Right. Right. Tony, you have been fantastic with your time. I just want to ask you one final question. You worked very closely with two people who may run for president in 2020, Joe Biden and John Kerry. What I'd love to hear you talk about a little bit is how would a Biden foreign policy or a Kerry foreign policy be different from an Obama foreign policy because I think most people think it would be exactly the same. And I'm just wondering what you think. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Look, I can't speak for either Secretary Kerry or Vice President Biden when it comes to what policies they would pursue if they, you know, were to continue in public life in some fashion. I think, in fact, in either case, the basic principles were the same. But we're also in a different moment. And it's the moment we talked about at the very outset, a moment in which there are people in our own country, people in allied countries, people around the world who are feeling a sense of chaos, confusion and vulnerability because of the rapidity and profundity of change, technological change, the flow of information, at the same time, a paradox when, by so many metrics, we're better off than we've ever been in history and, yet, too many people left out and left behind in that situation. The best way to look at it is, on the one hand, over the last 30 to 40 years extraordinary success in alleviating poverty around the world. And, yet, inequality is growing at the same time. And those two things put together create a lot of disaffected people either economically or culturally and, then, finally, huge power shifts not only among countries but beyond them, between them, the rise of China that we talked about but also super empowered groups and individuals, corporate chieftains, the mayors of megacities, all of these new actors making it more difficult for nation states to get the results that they would get in the past. That's an increasingly new reality. And technology's driving a lot of it. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: But the next President's going to have adjust to. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: The next president, whoever it is, has to deal with that. And I think that, again, this comes down to a president who understands that whatever foreign policy we pursue, it has to actually work for people here at home. It has to show them that it's making their own lives safer, more prosperous. And, ultimately, that's the test. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Tony, thank you for being with us. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: Great to be with you, Mike, as always.",

            "article_content": "In this episode of the \"Intelligence Matters\" podcast, host Michael Morell speaks with Michael Bennet, U.S. Senator from Colorado and a current Democratic presidential candidate. Morell and Bennet discuss the state of American politics and the ideologies and objectives that would define a Bennet administration. Bennet, who was recently added to the Senate Intelligence Committee, discusses the state of U.S. election security and his priorities for confronting Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. Bennet also discusses his views of alliances and plans for bolstering global stability.\u00a0 On China:\u00a0\"[W]hether we like it or not, we are in a contest with China now for the future of the world. And they are acting like that. And we are not. We're not even showing up. We got a guy in the White House who doesn't have any idea what he's doing in foreign policy. They know exactly what they're doing -- which does not mean they won't make mistakes.\" INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET CORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELL PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSenator Bennet, welcome to the show. It is great to have you. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tIt's wonderful to be here. Thank you. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tI should tell our listeners that we have made the offer to many of the candidates running for president to come on this show to discuss foreign policy and national security. And Senator Bennet, you're the first to say yes. So thank you very much. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tWell, I'm grateful for the opportunity. I'm sure the others will be here. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSenator, I do want to talk about foreign policy and national security. But I'd like to start somewhere else. And that's with our own politics which looks to  many people, including me, like it's broken. And the reason I want to talk about it is because I believe that doing what we need to do in the world to keep our country safe is not going to happen unless we fix our own house, unless we get our own house in order. \tSo perhaps the most important question that I'm going to ask you in the next 40 minutes or so is what is ailing American politics? And what would you do if elected to fix it? And I should mention before you answer that you just wrote a book about this very issue which I found very interesting. It's titled A Land of Flickering Lights; Restoring America in the Age of Broken Politics. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tThank you very much for reading it. Our politics is broken. And I think it's important to understand that Donald Trump is as symptom of those broken politics rather than the essential cause of those broken politics. Why is it broken, you ask? \tOne reason has nothing to do with politics. It's economics. Fifty years of an American economy where all of the growth has gone to the top 10% of the American people and 90% of the American people basically haven't seen a pay increase. So if you ask me to summarize for you my last ten years of town halls, it's very simple. It's people coming saying, \"We're working really hard. But we can't afford some combination of housing, health care, higher education, early childhood education. In other words, we can't afford a middle-class life. We can't save anything for our kids.\" \tAnd when people are under that kind of stress and feeling that sort of compression it makes it difficult for them to think about other things. If I think about the families I used to work for in the Denver Public Schools when I was the school superintendent who are mostly kids of color and mostly kids living in poverty, what their families would say is,  \"We're killing ourselves.\" \tAnd they are. They're working two and three jobs. \"We're killing ourselves and no matter what we do we can't get our kids out of poverty.\" And the sense among the American people was that Washington wasn't paying any attention to that. Whether we elected Democrats or Republicans, nothing ever changed. \tAnd so there was a sense among some people, \"Let's elect this reality TV star. Things can't possibly get any worse.\" Of course we know they have gotten worse. And which brings me to my second observation which is that at the same time we're coming to the end of that, hopefully, the end of that 50 years of a lack of economic mobility. \tOur institutions were crumbling under the pressure of the collapse of print journalism. The Supreme Court's terrible decision in Citizens United which gave billionaires the key to the kingdom when it came \u00a0 to running our democracy. Excessive gerrymandering that helped fuel the rise of the freedom caucus and the Tea Party. The billionaires helped fuel that rise too which grew out of a reactionary politics that occurred after the election of President Barack Obama. \tAnd all of that taken together has sort of conspired to create a situation where Washington D.C. is broken. There's a better way of saying it, that our politics. Because I think at the local level our politics still works. Here it doesn't work. So if you'll just indulge me for one second, the other day in Des Moines a woman asked me, \"Can democracy,\" and her question was, \"Can western democracy address climate change?\" \tAnd I said to her, \"You have just asked the most existential question anybody has asked me because our institutions are in rubble today. And that suits Mitch McConnell's purposes and Donald Trump's purposes because all they want to do is put right-wing judges on the  courts and occasionally cut taxes for wealthy people.\" \t\"If you want to solve climate change you need to imagine a politics where you're not just putting something in for two years and the other side rips it out and you put it in for two years and the other side rips it out.\" You can't solve climate two years at a time. In the end, we actually need something called an American climate policy like we used to have something called American foreign policy. But when you look at our politics smashed into smithereens, it's very hard to imagine how you do that. And it's one of the reasons I'm running for president because I believe the only way to do that is to create a constituency for change out in America that says, \"We will come together to support durable solutions to the problems that we face.\" \tAnd as we're doing that, we're going to reform our democracy to get the money out of it and put more people into it. \u00a0 We are under deep-stress and your intuition that we can't solve the issues that we confront internationally with the broken political system I think is correct. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo Senator, let's shift to foreign policy and national security which is what this show's all about. \tAnd maybe the place to start is with your own interest in the world. You did not have a lot of jobs that were directly related to foreign policy in your career. But your father was a diplomat. And you do serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. So I'd love to ask you two questions. What did you learn from your father about the world and America's role in the world? And what have you learned from serving on the Intelligence Committee about that? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tSo I was, as a result of my father's service, I was born in New Delhi, India, first of all. And from him I learned that public service is noble, which I think is a very important thing for us to  understand at this moment when it's being denigrated by the Trumpian wing of the Republican Party. \tAnd second, I learned from him that the world is interconnected and that America has a particularly unique role to play in our expression of pluralistic values and democratic values, small D democratic values. I should say it would be an incomplete answer if I didn't say this, I also, my mother's side of the family had a very different set of circumstances than my dad's. \tShe and her parents were Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust, who immigrated here when she was about 11. She was the only one in the family that could speak English. She enrolled herself in school. And I've never met anybody with stronger accents than my grandparents had. And I've never met greater patriots than they were. \tSo the combination is the reason that I'm in public service to begin \u00a0 with. And what I've learned by being in the Intelligence Committee I would say two things. 1) how dangerous the world is that we live in. 2) the incredible capacity we have to confront that danger. And 3) how committed the men and women are of our intelligence agencies to keeping this country safe even at a moment when they're under attack by the president of the United States. They are showing up to go to work every day to act in the national security interests of our country. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo we've seen a lot of erosion of capacity in the State Department, for example. Have we seen that in the intelligence community or not? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tI don't think to the same degree. But I do think, my impression is, that it's harder to hire people than it used to be. And it's harder to find talent. On the State Department, I met with one of the best known, toughest ambassadors who we've ever had, a guy who served in Iraq and Afghanistan within the  last year. \tAnd at the end of our meeting he said, \"I'm going to the State Department.\" I said, \"Why are you going to the State Department?\" And he said, \"I'm going there because every single senior foreign service officer has two jobs now. One job is doing their job. And the other job is doing whatever they can do to keep junior foreign service officers from quitting.\" \tAnd that's a terrible legacy of this Trump era and of Mike Pompeo's secretary of state tenure. And now that we've got this clear manipulation of the Ukraine situation for partisan political purposes, that's only going to further cast a pall, I think. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tI have to tell you, there's a coffee shop halfway between my house and the CIA and I've had dozens and dozens and dozens of coffees with current intelligence officers who want to know, okay, how do you make \u00a0 the transition to the private sector? And my answer to them is, \"Don't go anywhere. Your country needs you now more than ever.\" \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tAnd it's true. And they need to hear that from everybody. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo how did you end up on the Intelligence Committee? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tI wanted to be on it because I'd been in the Senate for ten years. And I thought it was important I was not on a committee that gave me international exposure. And I wanted particularly to be on that committee because I thought it'd be fascinating to learn what our intelligence capabilities look like. And it has been fascinating. \tThe other thing I like about the committee is it's a lot less partisan than a lot of the other committees because it's behind closed doors, it's not in front of the television cameras. And I think people in general do their work properly there. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo how's it possible that the Senate Intelligence Committee has been able to carry out its responsibilities in a bipartisan or nonpartisan way and the House Intelligence Committee has really struggled with that? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tWell, we don't have Congressman Nunes at our committee which may be a reason why. And I just think there's just been more of a tradition in the Senate of trying to carry out these responsibilities in a bipartisan way. We don't do it perfectly. But it's one of the reasons why I like to serve on it. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo senator, with that as background, let me ask you what a Bennet administration's foreign policy would look like. What would its priorities be, what would our posture in the world but it's? What would be its ideological underpinnings? How do you think about that? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tIdeological underpinnings, to start there, is that democracy is a virtuous way of organizing human beings. And that the best thing we can do for people like my mom and my grandparents, is be the best democracy we can be to show the world that pluralism is a normatively beneficial way for human beings to organize themselves. \tIt's particularly important with the rise of China for us to embrace those democratic values. That's not the same thing as saying we should be exporting democracy around the world. But I do know for my parents' example what an important beacon of light this country is when we are, we're not perfect, but trying to live up to our founding principles. So that's sort of the overarching thing. Underneath that I would say making sure that we burnish alliances all over the world. So the first visit I would make if I were elected president would be to Europe to say, \"We are here to defend western democracy. That's why I'm here.\" \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tWe're back. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tWe're back. We're with you. We don't view you as some sort of liability. But together we have to push back on Russia, on China. Where I think Trump actually was right to call the question on China. He just did it in an utterly counterproductive way. \tWe share equities with almost every other country in the world with respect to China. It's a colossus. And it's going to grow. Think about this, its economy has quadrupled since 2001. It has tripled since 2004. It's doubled since we went into the Great Recession. And they're going to continue to grow. We want those markets open to us. And we can build a forceful coalition of trading partners to say, \"China, we want to sell into you and we want you to do a better job of following the rules of the road.\" \tIt's not going to be easy to do that but it does provide us a very important organizing principle and a reason to be working with other nations which I think will lead to a more peaceful world. In our hemisphere we have seen what happens when you don't have real leadership. On this immediate refugee crisis at our border we could resolve that if we had a president who led all the countries from Canada to Argentina in saying, \"Let's figure out how to resettle these people. And then let's figure out what to do with the underlying causes of the misery in the Northern Triangle countries that are resulting in people fleeing for their lives.\" And then in the Middle East where I would start is to try to rebuild the alliances to a successful negotiation of the Iran agreement to see whether there's a piece of business that can be done there. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tIn thinking about your foreign policy, what your foreign policy would \u00a0 be, is there a particular president, is there a particular secretary of state that you, national security advisor, that you admire for how they handled when they were in charge of the-- \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tIt's interesting. I haven't. I've never thought about it that way. I will think about it that way. It's hard not to think of Franklin Roosevelt as somebody who acquitted themselves very well in that job. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSenator, one more question before we get to some specific issues. And I want to ask about the salience of foreign policy and national security on the campaign trail. It doesn't seem to be high on the priority list of the voters. Certainly not the media. Is that perception on my part, right? And if so, is that concerning to you? And how do you talk to folks about it? How do you get folks to think about its importance? How do you talk about all that? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tSo I'd say three quick things. 1) your perception is right although in every single meeting that I have somebody asks, \"What are you going to do to restore America's alliances?\" And that's I think good news that people are worried about that and thinking about that and understanding that it comes at a cost for our country to turn our back on our allies. So I think that's point one. \tHow do you get people to care or interested in about it? Last weekend Donald Trump spent the whole weekend tweeting out things that if anybody else in America tweeted out, they'd be meeting with the HR department on Monday morning. And the HR department would be saying, \"If you keep doing that, you're gone.\" And if the answer to that from the person was, \"Oh don't worry about it. I'm a stable genius with unmatched wisdom,\" that would be it. You'd be finished. \tBut because this guy is our president on that weekend as he was  obsessing with cable television and tweets, China was signing trade agreements with enough economies that if you add it all up together it represents half the GDP of the world. Iran was doubling the number of centrifuges they were using to enrich uranium at the same time he was doing that. \tSo it's important for people to hear that because when they hear that it makes them angry and aggravated about it. Or another example I like to use is the example of China. I just mentioned how much their economy has grown in the last ten, 15 years. Another way of thinking about that is in three years in the last decade they poured more cement than we did in the 20th century. While we spent seven months horsing around with issues about $6 billion for Trump's wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for, China is building a vast telecommunications network that stretches from Latin America to Africa, connecting to the surveillance state of China. \tAnd also massively investing in their One Belt One Road initiative. This comes at huge cost to our position in the world, and I would say to humanity's position in the world, because if you're living in a world in Africa where if you get elected to office, you go to the party for your election and then you go back to your office and there's a plane ticket waiting for you to take you to Beijing, and we're absent, that's a problem for us. So those are some of the ways I talk about it. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo one of the things that strikes me in listening to what you just said, senator, is that a number of your opponents on the campaign trail seem to side with the idea that the U.S. should withdraw from the world which is deeply concerning to me. And where do those pressures come from? Do they come from the same place that our broken politics come from? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tThey do. They do actually. They do because what have we done with our \u00a0 broken politics? And there's an answer. Since 2001, we have essentially borrowed $5 trillion from the Chinese to give tax cuts to rich people. And we borrowed another $5.6 trillion from the Chinese to fight these wars in the Middle East. So that's $11 trillion or $12 trillion or $13 trillion that from the vantage point of the people, they're struggling in the American economy. We might has well have lit on fire. \tAnd I'm not sure people know that exactly or precisely but they have a sense of it. And that coupled with the terrible disaster of the Iraq war has combined I think to create a caution about what it is we're doing in the world. And to me that's completely understandable. \tThe question then is what do we do about it? So Trump looks at the Iraq war and he says to himself, \"Well, the Iraq war was emblematic.\" He's not saying. He would say, \"That's emblematic of American foreign  policy for the last 70 years.\" \tInstead of understanding that the Iraq war was a departure from, certainly our most successful, foreign policy over the last 70 years. But unfortunately the lesson he's learned from that leads him to a place where it's just we're going to get out. So you look at something like Northern Syria. I am completely convinced. This is after five years of fighting side by side with the Kurds to put ISIS in a box -- we lost six guys. Six guys over five years. That's a tragedy. Kurds lost 11,000 people. And that looks to me like a huge success.\u00a0 \tTo pick that as the one thing that we're going to retreat from because Trump can't stand up to Erdogan -- I don't think there's a president in American history that would have made the decision that Trump did. And it's a reflection of how weak he is and how poorly he understands the lessons that were learned. \tSo the American people deserve to have a president who learns the right lessons from our mistakes as well as our successes. I spent some time this week on the way back in the airplane on the way back from the West Coast reading the army college report on Iraq. I don't know if you've seen that yet. But it's two or three volumes. Hundreds and hundreds of pages that basically concludes that the only winner of the Iraq war was Iran. And the part that I was reading was about all the miscalculations that were made. These are things the American people deserve to understand because in their name Washington made terrible, terrible judgments. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo senator, I want to run through some specific issues. And the way I'd like to do this, if it's okay with you, is I want to toss out the name of a foreign leader and get your kind of gut reaction. And the reason that I want to do it this way is because as  president these people would be your counterparts. Right? You'd be dealing with them. You'd be thinking about how to deal with them. So I think it's an interesting way to come at the issues. So let's start with Russian president Putin. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tTyrant. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tTalk about him. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tSo he's basically sitting on top of a mountain of kleptocracy. And I think one of the reasons why Donald Trump has such a hard time with him is that he's more successful. He's been a more successful looter of his country than Donald Trump has been. \tObviously he's acting in his interests and his interests are utterly conflated with the interests of the Russian state. And Europe needs us to stand by them as their ally pushing back against Putin. They can't do it on their own. And he still hasn't been  sanctioned for the attack on our elections in 2016 which continues to this day because we have a president who stood next to Putin in Helsinki and explicit took Putin's word over the word of the nation's intelligence agencies. It's reprehensible. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSenator, you wrote a book several months ago now about Russia's disinformation efforts in 2016 and beyond. It's called Dividing America: How Russia Hacked our Democracy. Why did you feel the need to write that? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tGreat question. Thank you for that. I felt the need to write it because I think the American people didn't really understand what the nature of that attack looked like. And I wanted them to be able to see it, be able to hold it in their hands. \tTo me the most discouraging thing about that attack was we actually didn't discover it for a year. And when you look at the Russian propaganda it's the most vile,  racist stuff you could imagine in part because they were seeking to divide us, they saw our pluralism, diversity as a weakness, not a strength. \tBut I think it says a lot that it was completely unrecognizable to us from our own political discourse. In other words, what does it say about us right now when we can't distinguish between our political discourse with Russian propaganda that's meant to hurt our country and wound our country? So that's why I published it. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tAnd looking ahead to 2020, how aggressive do you expect the Russians to be? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tI think they will be very aggressive. They've basically been invited in by the American president. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tAnd how would you assess our preparations as a government for defending against them? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tThat's the good news. I think that without going into any detail about it, I believe we were much better protected in '18 than we were in '16 because of the work of our intelligence agencies. And they are continuing to work. They are on the mission whether the president agrees with what they said or not. They are on the mission. \tThe threat is evolving. It's changing. And it's not confined to Russia anymore. Other countries are trying to assault our democracy as well. And think about this, Mike, just for the listeners who might be saying, \"I don't really care about this.\" Imagine living a world where you can't be sure that the result at the voting booth is the actual result that happened. When that happens our democracy could be at an end. And it could happen to us and to western Europe at the same time. This is the nature of the threat that we're under. \tAnd that's why the fact that McConnell has been so unwilling, Mitch  McConnell, to pass election protection legislation that would help us make more resilient our hardware and software at the local level so we can protect the ballot box is really problematic. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tIn fact, there's bipartisan bills. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tThey're all bipartisan as far as I know. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tAnd why the reluctance? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tThat's a great question. You would think the people in Kentucky would want to have their elections protected. I think he's just trying to protect Donald Trump who doesn't want to ever admit that the Russians interfered in his election for whatever reason. But certainly the most benign explanation for that is that he doesn't want the American people to think that he got an unfair advantage because Putin helped him win. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo our next leader, Xi Jinping, how do you think about him? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tI think about him as somebody who's playing a very long game. And I also think that Donald Trump has misplayed his hand on the trade deal in a way that Xi -- it could be said that our next election may rest in his hands because he is now in a position to make a decision about whether he grants Donald Trump a victory on trade that gives him something to go back to our farmers and ranchers with, who have been so abused by Donald Trump's trading policies, or not. I think Putin and Xi both would like to see Donald Trump reelected because they have been able to enhance their roles in the world as a result of Donald Trump being elected. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tAnd to paint us as a failing democracy. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tAnd to paint us as a failing democracy. And four more years of that is probably really good from their point of view. And whether we like it or not we are in a contest \u00a0 with China now for the future of the world. And they are acting like that. And we are not. We're not even showing up. We got a guy in the White House who doesn't have any idea what he's doing in foreign policy. They know exactly what they're doing which does not mean they won't make mistakes. But we shouldn't count on that. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo you said earlier that you do give the president some credit for calling the Chinese out on sometimes the anti-competitive practices that they pursue. But that the president hasn't gone about taking them on on that in the right way. What would you do? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tWhat I would do is mobilize the rest of the world whose interests I think are completely aligned with us. Asia. The countries in Asia have no desire to be dominated in a unipolar world by either China or us. They'd much rather be in a bipolar world and we give them that opportunity. \tAfrica. China is everywhere in Africa. But they're entering into these debt deals with countries as they are in other parts of Asia and other places, that have turned out to be quite damaging where China ends up owning the port. We are in the position to come in and sweep in after that. \tAnd there is a desire -- I was in eight African countries in the year before I decided to run for president. There's a strong desire for us to show up there. And in our own hemisphere, I think. So I actually believe that when we think about the contest with China, we don't need to think about them as our enemy. There's not a reason to do that. \tBut I do think it provide a very clarifying way for us to think about the world and how we advance our interest of the world, democracy's interest in the world and the free-market system. It's useful. And we should be thinking about that in a coherent way. And there \u00a0 is no way that 330 million people can outcompete the Chinese or even compete with the Chinese without allies around the world. It's the only way we can do it. And I think we should look at that as a positive because it can lead to peace. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tAs you know, we did have a set of allies who came together and were prepared to say to China, \"You can have more influence in the world. You can play more in the world if you follow the rules.\" But we threw it away. It was the Transpacific Partnership. Would you go back to something like that? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tWe've got to do something. I think that that failed in part because there was no political predicate in our national politics to support that agreement. People didn't see it as a national security agreement. They didn't see it as something that was important for our geopolitical standing in the world. \tAnd we have had a lot of negative effects of trade as well that we  have not as a country responded to. And I believe that we've got to sort of simultaneously respond to that dislocation and at the same time say, \"We're not closing ourselves off from the rest of the world.\" And not only that, that we've got an important geopolitical role to play in Asia to push back on Chinese dominance there. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo two more people real quick. Supreme leader of Iran. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tHe has been strengthened by the Trump administration as have the hard-liners in Iran. Our walking away from the Iran deal was like jumping out of a lifeboat just because we didn't like it when there was no other lifeboat in sight. \tAnd I think the Iran deal represented a rare attempt of us trying to manage a situation in the Middle East rather than go to war with it. When Trump ripped up the deal our intelligence community assessed that Iran was more than a year out from breaking out to nuclear \u00a0 weapon was a big improvement from being two to three months away, which is where they were when we signed the deal. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tAnd were heading towards two to three weeks at the pace they were-- \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tThat's right. Exactly. And why does that matter for the listeners? It matters because if you have two to three weeks it's very hard to mobilize the rest of the world to push back. You may end up in a place where Iran is forcing you to make a decision whether to unilaterally attack or not. \tAnd when you've got a year you can do the planning that's required to actually have an intelligent and strategic reaction. I think the supreme leader and the hard-liners in Iran have been extremely successful in creating a regional hegemony since we invaded the Iraq war. That report by the war college that I mentioned earlier concludes that the only winner of the Iraq war was Iran. I share that view. And I think their malevolence in the  region and the danger they pose to our national security and to Israel is real. And it's significant for us to push back on it. \tHaving said that, they have successfully moved into Yemen. They've successfully moved into Southern Iraq. And actually even parts of Northern Iraq. Have incredible influence in Syria that they didn't used to have. Still have the influence in Lebanon that they've always had. And that's very concerning to me. \tAnd unfortunately part of what Trump has done is I think he's strengthened the hands of the hard-liners because the hard-liners didn't want anything to do with the Iran deal to begin with. And they said that we would break the deal. And in fact, we have broken the deal. And what have the Iranians done recently? They showed the whole world that they could hit the Saudi oil infrastructure with a degree of precision that nobody knew they had.  And that's causing everybody to think about how we react to them. And it's another reason why Donald Trump has to be a one-term president. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo what would you do vis a vis the Iranians? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tI think the first thing to would be to try to reestablish the alliance that made the Iran deal possible. It was an alliance of the P5+1. It was cortical to have China and India's part of that. And I wouldn't necessarily say we have to sign exactly the same deal. But it would be good for us to try to flex those muscles again and build that alliance. These guys are very, very dangerous customers in Iran. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tOne more name, senator. Kim Jong-un. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tObviously it's very hard to tell what his personal capabilities are. But I think he's played Donald Trump for a patsy. Trump has accepted on face value Kim's statement \u00a0 that-- he didn't even really make a statement that he would denuclearize. But the idea that they would denuclearize which they have said in the past. But they've never actually done. And what has happened since they had their, was it Hanoi where they had their meeting? \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tYes. Yes. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tWhere basically Trump said, \"You can sleep well at night,\" on his way back from there. That's what he tweeted out. Basically what's happened is, whether he knew it or not, he's created a cover for Kim to continue to pursue his nuclear program and his missile program which he has done. \tThere has been no halt in doing what he's done. And that's damaging to us. So once again, it would be foolish for people to think that these other countries are not pursuing their national security imperatives from their vantage point, from their point of  view. They may have notions that are completely contrary to ours. Whether you're talking about Russia, Iran, North Korea. It would be fair to say they are completely contrary to ours. \tBut they are not incoherent. And the incoherence that we are projecting is creating a danger for the world. For most of the last 70 years we obviously have not been perfect. Iraq, Vietnam. But for most of the last 70 years we have been a force for stability in the world. We've been a force to sort of try to tamp down the storm. Now, in a way, we are the storm. And other people are taking serious advantage of that. Putin, China, North Korea, Iran. They have all benefited from having Donald Trump as our president. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSenator, you've been fantastic with your time. I want to ask you one more question. I'm wondering if you've given thought, and I'm sure you have, to a couple of the really tough jobs of being president. As  commander in chief, ordering young women and young men into harm's way and then having to call or write to parents or spouses or children who have lost a son or daughter, husband or wife or parent, how do you think about that? \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tI've thought a lot about that. I've thought a lot about that because even in the job that I have today once or twice a week I write a letter to somebody who's lost their loved one in service of the United States. And I believe that ultimate sacrifice we need to make sure is worth people making. \tAnd if it's in service to our democracy and service to the idea that we have inherited something very precious in the history of human kind from our parents and grandparents, from the people that founded this country, that is our obligation to pass that off to the next generation. And that as long as we're doing that, the service people that die defending this country and our interest will not have died \u00a0 in vain. And that's why I think it's so important that we have a new president at the end of the next election. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSenator, thank you very much. \t\tSENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: \tThank you for having me, Mike. I appreciate it. Thank you. \t\t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

I'm Margaret Brennan. And this is FACE THE NATION. Six weeks after the Mueller report's completion President Trump is still taking victory laps. This time in a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He said something to the effect that it started off as a mountain, and it ended up being a mouse. MARGARET BRENNAN: Russian interference in the 2016 election is, of course, what prompted the investigation in the first place. KRISTEN WELKER: Did you tell him not to meddle in the next election? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We didn't discuss that. Really, we didn't discuss it. MARGARET BRENNAN: What should be done to punish Russia and keep them from meddling again? We'll talk with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; and attorney general William Barr faces a firestorm on Capitol Hill, angering Democrats on one committee-- MAZIE HIRONO: Please, Mister Attorney General, you know, give us some credit for knowing what the hell is going on around here. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and declining to appear before another. STEVE COHEN: Chicken Barr should have shown up today and answered questions. MARGARET BRENNAN: That same committee is threatening to hold him in contempt of Congress. We'll explain why. And there is outrage over some of Barr's answers in testimony last month. NANCY PELOSI: He lied to Congress. And if anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll ask the top Republican on the House Committee, Doug Collins, and California Democrat Eric Swalwell what's next. Plus, we'll speak to the number-two Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin of Illinois. We'll have plenty of analysis on all of the news of the week. It's just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It's quiet here in Washington but that is not the case in other parts of the world. Overnight we've seen the worst flare-up in violence between Israel and Hamas in months. Hamas fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, which responded with what Prime Minister Netanyahu called massive airstrikes in Gaza. Meanwhile, North Korea tested what appeared to be short-range missiles as President Trump's diplomatic outreach stalls. Kim Jong-un personally oversaw that launch. And in Venezuela, a U.S.-backed uprising against Nicolas Maduro fizzled as opposition leader Juan Guaido was unable to peel away his key military support. We begin this morning with America's top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Welcome to FACE THE NATION on a very busy morning for you. On this latest North Korea test, it appears to be short-range missiles. Does Kim Jong-un get a pass on this or are we looking at a situation where more sanctions are necessary? MIKE POMPEO (Secretary of State/@SecPompeo): So the sanctions haven't changed. The toughest sanctions in the history of North Korea remain in place. That's probably what's putting some of the pressure on Chairman Kim today. You saw this happen too right after his visit to Russia. Right-- right after he spoke with Vladimir Putin, he made the decision to take these actions. We're still evaluating the appropriate response. But I want everyone in your audience to know we're going to exhaust every diplomatic opportunity there is. I continue to invite our counterparts for negotiations. We still believe there is a path forward where Chairman Kim can denuclearize without resort to anything beyond diplomacy. We're hopeful that we can achieve that. We've made real progress between Singapore and Hanoi and we hope that progress can continue. It would be the best outcome for the world and Chairman Kim's commitment that he made to President Trump back in Singapore remains in effect. He has said he's prepared to denuclearize. My task as America's most senior diplomat is to achieve that. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when President Trump tweeted \"I'm with him,\" he wasn't saying that this test will go without consequence. MIKE POMPEO: I think President Trump understands that the path forward that is the most optimal for the entire world is a negotiated solution to this. So we're-- he-- I talked to him last night. We are full speed ahead and trying to work with the North Koreans to diplomatically achieve the verified denuclearization on the peninsula. MARGARET BRENNAN: Cynthia Warmbier, the mother of Otto Warmbier, the college student from the University of Virginia who died in North-- after being released from North Korean custody, spoke out forcefully about Kim Jong-un and the diplomacy under way. Take a listen. CYNTHIA WARMBIER: This is not only a nuclear problem this is a problem that we're dealing with absolute evil. There is a charade going on right now. It's called diplomacy. How can you have diplomacy with someone that never tells the truth? MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to her? MIKE POMPEO: Well, I've gotten to know the Warmbier family, especially Cindy. She is an amazing patriot and a remarkable woman and I have enormous sympathy for her and admiration for her as well, and I completely understand her remarks. We're hopeful. We-- we don't expect Chairman Kim to tell us the truth. That's why we're going to verify any denuclearization that takes place. That's why we will ensure that we see actual on-the-ground-- on-the-ground outcomes. We're not going to take anyone's word for it but we want to work to try and do that in a way that is a negotiated solution and that's our mission set. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you still President Trump's lead negotiator on North Korea? MIKE POMPEO: So far as I know. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the North Koreans have said that they objected to-- MIKE POMPEO: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --negotiating with you personally. MIKE POMPEO: The North Koreans don't get to choose our negotiator and we don't get to choose theirs. Each of these two leaders is also very personally committed to this effort. They've both shown great effort to try and achieve this outcome. I-- I'm working to support those two leaders so that we can get the outcome that the world deserves. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about China. Chinese officials are headed here to Washington for trade talks. MIKE POMPEO: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: We heard from a Pentagon official on Friday, a pretty stark description of what is underway right now in China. He said that there are three million Muslims being rounded up into concentration camps in China. Why hasn't the administration taken any kind of action or sanction against Beijing for this? MIKE POMPEO: Oh, goodness. The-- President Trump has pushed back against China in a way that no previous President had. They'd-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Concentration camps-- MIKE POMPEO: --they'd given-- they-- they had given the Chinese a free pass in every dimension. President Trump is now pushing back on the enormous trade abuses. You've seen me personally speak out about the same situation that you're describing, this-- this number certainly up to a million people held in reeducation camps. The Trump administration is going to hold every nation accountable-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You're okay with that term, reeducation camps, not concentration camps, which the Pentagon used? MIKE POMPEO: We can-- we can use lots of different terms to describe what's taking place. This is an enormous human rights violations. I've spoken about it repeatedly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why the difference between-- MIKE POMPEO: The entire administration has spoken on it repeatedly. MARGARET BRENNAN: You just said a million minorities. MIKE POMPEO: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Pentagon says three million. MIKE POMPEO: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a discrepancy within the administration-- MIKE POMPEO: No. MARGARET BRENNAN: --on what to do about this and what's actually happening? MIKE POMPEO: There-- there-- there's-- there-- there's not. Don't-- don't-- don't play ticky tac. There's no discrepancy. This administration this-- this-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Concentration camps is a loaded term, Sir. MIKE POMPEO: Ma'am-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And three million Muslims being rounded up is something that many would expect the United States to raise-- MIKE POMPEO: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --at the highest levels. MIKE POMPEO: And-- and we've done so. MARGARET BRENNAN: So sanctions-- MIKE POMPEO: So-- so it sounds like-- it sounds like you're satisfied with that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- MIKE POMPEO: Right. We-- we've done so, right? And so-- so don't-- don't-- don't-- don't make-- don't make-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But why use sanctions? Should we expect that? Be-- because the accusation as you know, Sir, is that the trade talks are causing the U.S. to choose its own financial interests over its values. Are you saying that's not the case and there will be actions taken? MIKE POMPEO: Thanks for the clarification of your question, I-- I appreciate that. This administration can do more than one thing at a time. We're working to stop the intellectual property theft that has destroyed millions of jobs in the United States. We're working to stop the foreign technology transfer-- foreign technology transfers that have taken place. We have got the largest defense budget in history in place, part of which will go to ensuring we counter Chinese military power. We're working on these human rights violations, as well. This administration takes a backseat to no one in our efforts and our outcomes in achieving a more rational relationship with China. The previous administration put us in a bad place and we're working to fix it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Were you just saying human rights are going to be included in the trade deal? MIKE POMPEO: No. Human-- human rights are-- are going to be addressed. MARGARET BRENNAN: On-- MIKE POMPEO: And we've done so. I've raised it in multiple conversations with my counterpart, their foreign minister, and with others. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got the whole world as your portfolio, so let's move on to Venezuela and Russia. There was this phone call between Vladimir Putin and President Trump that just happened. The President described it to us in an Oval Office spray. Why didn't he bring up election interference on this phone call when he said he did discuss the findings of the Mueller Report which found sweeping and systematic Russian interference in 2016? MIKE POMPEO: Well, you'll have to ask the White House that question. The President has been very clear. The administration has taken great action. I wish the previous one had stopped the election interference that took place in 2016. They failed to do so. Between 2017 when President Trump came into office and 2018, we had a successful election year, a set of midterm elections. We're working diligently to ensure that the elections in 2020 aren't interfered with by Russia, by Iran, by North Korea or anyone else. We have enormous resource deployed against that challenge. And the American people should be sure that their government is working hard to keep our election safe and secure. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said this week that Moscow has hundreds of people in Venezuela and you were very clear that you think it was Russia that convinced Nicolas Maduro not to get on a plane and to flee the country. Here's what the President said during his-- after his phone call with Vladimir Putin. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Friday): He is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela, other than he'd like to see something positive happen for Venezuela and I feel the same way. MARGARET BRENNAN: There seems to be a difference in how the President described the situation and how you and Ambassador Bolton have described it. MIKE POMPEO: No, no difference, no difference. The pre-- the President has said, I think he in fact tweeted that the Russians must leave Venezuela. We've asked every nation that is interfere-- interfering with Venezuelan democracy, you've seen this. I-- I was down on the border. We saw mothers who couldn't feed their children fleeing the country. We saw families that had sick kids but couldn't get medicine. It's all sitting, sitting within 50 miles of where we were located. And Maduro won't allow it to come in. The President has been very clear. We want the Cubans out. There are Iranians on the ground there. We want the Russians. We want everyone out so that the Venezuelan people can get the democracy they deserve, that includes Mr. Maduro leaving. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when he says-- the President says Putin is not looking to get involved at all in Venezuela, that is not the President accepting him at face value? MIKE POMPEO: He'll have to leave-- he'll have to live with-- MARGARET BRENNAN: He knows but that's not the case? MIKE POMPEO: The President has tweeted that he wants the Russians out of Venezuela. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, he was just putting a positive spin on things in that moment? MIKE POMPEO: We are working very diligently to ensure that Maduro leaves and we get free and fair elections in Venezuela. That will require the 2,300 Cuban security personnel, frankly, the people closest to Maduro who are protecting the in-tight security for Maduro. They have got to leave. We're working on that as well. We're working with the Cubans to try and get an outcome that will let the Venezuelans have this opportunity. MARGARET BRENNAN: On this-- I know you will be meeting with the Russian foreign minister in the coming days. Is there a deal to be struck with Russia on this front? I mean Russia benefits, right, by having Venezuelan oil off the market, by having a level of influence in America's backyard. Is the U.S. going to negotiate a deal with Russia on Venezuela? MIKE POMPEO: I'll certainly bring up Venezuela. It will be one of many topics that Foreign Minister Lavrov and I speak-- speak about, whether there is a particular deal that can be reached, only time will tell. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lindsey Graham, the Republican Senator from South Carolina, who I know you know well, tweeted this week, \"Cuba, Russia send troop to prop up Maduro on Venezuela while we talk and have sanctions. Where is our aircraft carrier?\" He seems to be calling a bluff here on your mention and mention from others that military options aren't off the table. What is actually being considered here, because you can't refer to the use of military force lightly? Is there an actual option that you are considering deploying in the coming days? MIKE POMPEO: Oh, goodness. The President has made clear that no option is off the table. We worked this week to further the planning so that we'd have a wide range of options, diplomatic options, political options, options that would involve the Department of Defense. We have made clear the President has-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that hospital shifts or that's actual offensive action? MIKE POMPEO: There will be many options that we will fully bake, make sure they're ready, get laid out in exquisite detail that are executable so that when the situation changes on the ground or the President makes a conclusion that it's path he wants to go down that these options are prepared for him. We would't want to be flat-footed and we have worked diligently to make sure that that capability--a wide range of capabilities are prepared to be executed. MARGARET BRENNAN: And just final point on this. Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader that the U.S. backs and many other countries recognize is a legitimate leader, has said that he, essentially, miscalculated the level of support in assuming the military would back him or break away from Maduro. Are you still saying a military option is on the table when the opposition leader we're backing can't get the support of his country's military? MIKE POMPEO: Well, he didn't get it that day. Although the senior intelligence official left. It's not the case that military haven't left. There have been lots of Venezuelan military that have departed. But-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Not enough to make that successful. MIKE POMPEO: Not yet. We're not there yet. We won't be successful until the day that we are. We are determined to see that the Venezuelan people have their democracy, as are 54 other nations, including most every nation in the region. They understand that three million refugees, three million migrants that have departed Venezuela and another two million this year is unacceptable for their region and they are working to build out a coalition to support the Venezuelan people and their democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Mr. Secretary, I'm told we have to leave it there. Thank you for coming in. MIKE POMPEO: Thank you, Ma'am. MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the number-two Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin of Illinois. He joins us this morning from Chicago. Senator, I-- I want to get to a number of these domestic issues with you, but I do know you had visited Venezuela within the past few years. Do you support the administration's approach here? SENATOR DICK DURBIN (D-Illinois/Minority Whip/@SenatorDurbin): Well, I support their approach, but I don't agree with Lindsey Graham. I am not in favor of military intervention, but I-- I can just tell you that I listened to Secretary of State Pompeo trying to explain this President's conversation with Vladimir Putin, and I just don't get it. This President is totally dazzled by Vladimir Putin, by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, by authoritarian leaders in countries like Brazil. He gets on the phone with them and he loses it, gets all googly eyed, over their assertions they have nothing to do with what's going on in Venezuela. Listen to what John Bolton says; listen to what-- even what Secretary of State Pompeo said. Russia has sent at least a planeload full of these little green men that we've seen in Eastern Ukraine and they are destabilizing the situation there. They're there to-- to support Maduro. They don't want to see the change that the American people want to see and that's to have a free election in that country, and a choice of someone democratically. MARGARET BRENNAN: Now to the question of Russian election interference in this country's election in 2016, which is, of course, what prompted the mush-- Mueller report and what brings us to where we are right now with the attorney general testifying to Congress about his description of that to the public. Speaker Pelosi said this week that A.G. Barr lied. Do you agree with her? SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I don't know what other conclusion you can reach. I asked him the question, point blank, and Charlie Crist of Florida asked him, \"Well, is there any effort by the people who worked on the Mueller staff and such to raise questions about the accuracy of what you said in your letter.\" And he said, \"No, I don't know.\" And the fact is he'd received a letter from Bob Mueller just a few days before that explicitly said, in writing, the concerns which he had with the characterizations by Attorney General Barr. I don't know any other way to characterize it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's listen to that exchange that you just referenced. (Begin VT) CHARLIE CRIST (April 9): Reports have emerged recently, General, that members of the special counsel's team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24th letter that it does not adequately or accurately necessarily portray the report's findings. Do you know what they're referencing with that? WILLIAM BARR (Attorney General/April 9): No, I don't. I think-- I think-- I suspect that they probably wanted, you know, more put out. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (April 10): Did Bob Mueller support your conclusion? WILLIAM BARR: I don't know whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusions. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: That was Congressman Crist and then Senator Van Hollen. Those questions that you are saying you view as a lie. Republicans, defenders of Attorney General Barr say, \"No, no. This was a-- a matter of answering the question regarding members of Mueller's own team disagreeing, not saying that he was not aware that the special counsel personally objected.\" Why don't you buy that excuse? SENATOR DICK DURBIN: I don't buy it at all. Let's be honest about it. Attorney General Barr not only received that letter from Bob Mueller, saying in writing that he disagreed with the attorney general's characterization of the Mueller report, he then had a telephone conversation with him to follow and to say he wasn't aware of Mueller's misgivings about his characterization. That is at-- at the minimum misleading, if not worse deception, to the American people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, you did have a chance to ask some questions of attorney-- the Attorney General, yourself. The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Lindsey Graham has since issued a letter saying that-- offering Robert Mueller the chance to testify, specifically, about this phone call in conversation with the Attorney General. Do you expect him to testify and-- and if he declines, do you consider that a closed matter? SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I hope it is not a closed matter because there's so many unanswered questions. Remember there are two volumes to the Mueller Report. The first volume deals with Russian interference in our election. Much of that is redacted. We need to know what they did which led to the indictment of Russians by Mueller and led to, I hope, a-- a new resolve by the United States to never let it happen again. But-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you expect him to testify? Take Lindsey Graham up on that offer? SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I would take him up on it but I asked him point blank on the record on Thursday in the Senate Judiciary Committee, \"are we going to have Bob Mueller before this committee?\" And he said no. As far as he was concerned it was over. If he's opened the door now to bring in Bob Miller-- Bob Mueller, good. I believe he should testify not only about the first volume on Russian interference but, clearly, about his conclusions or lack of conclusions on obstruction of justice. MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote an op-ed recently challenging the Attorney General and saying he should recuse himself from a number of the related investigations that have sprung off the Special Counsel's probe itself. Are you suggesting that the Attorney General would meddle in ongoing investigations regarding the President? SENATOR DICK DURBIN: I'm not going to suggest that. But I'll tell you this, for the sake of justice and in light of what we've seen in the rollout of Bob Barr, or Bill Barr's rollout of this Mueller Report, he should recuse himself. Fourteen different matters are being investigated because the Mueller in-- inquiry, the Mueller investigation and Mister Barr should not be a hindrance or raise any questions about whether this is going to be a-- an investigation and a prosecution with total integrity. He has raised that question because of his characterization of Mueller testimony. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, should he resign? SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I-- I've not called for resignation. Some of my colleagues have. But recusal? Yes. He should withdraw himself from any of the results that are leading-- could possibly lead to prosecutions because of the Mueller investigation. MARGARET BRENNAN: But aren't you concerned that this could just you know in some ways strengthen the President's decision to take this as a fighting matter, make this a matter of partisan politics. He clearly feels that the Mueller report, in his words, exonerated him and that this is a fight he wants to have in the public space. SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, the Mueller Report expressly said it was neither exonerating him nor finding him guilty. And that's what led to the conclusion by Mister Barr and Mister Rosenstein when it came to the obstruction of justice. But as far as I am concerned there is work to be done on the Mueller Report in Volume 1 to protect us from Russian interference. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR DICK DURBIN: The fact that the President of the United States had this conversation with Vladimir Putin, within the last several days, and didn't raise this issue after the Mueller report, what is he thinking? We don't want to relive what happened in 2016 in the United States. The Russians ought to take their hands off of our election process. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for joining us this morning. SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Thanks. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined-- we will be joined in a minute with Congressman Doug Collins. He's a top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. So, stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with Congressman Doug Collins. He's the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee and joins us from Warner Robins in his home state of Georgia. Good morning to you. Have you read the full 400-plus pages of the Mueller report? REPRESENTATIVE DOUG COLLINS (R-Georgia/@RepDougCollins/Judiciary Committee Ranking Member): Yeah. Good morning, Margaret. Yes, I have. And I've also read what Bill Barr actually-- let us go back and he actually opened it up even more and I have went to the Department of Justice and read the less redacted report which means that of the whole report I have read all of it except a little less than 2%, almost 1% of the report. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is what the Democrats on your committee are calling for to be made public and, in fact, there is this threat of holding the attorney general in contempt if he doesn't share more information and underlying evidence. Do you expect him to be held in contempt? REPRESENTATIVE DOUG COLLINS: It's really interesting, Margaret, what's happened here. I mean a little over sixteen days ago the chairman asked for this material. He knows that he can't get it in a normal oversight proceeding, but, yet, he's continuing on and now with pressure, it seems like from his own side they are going to move to contempt over not producing the documents, not showing up. This is about the documents. But if you go back to any other press before Eric Holder, you know (INDISTINCT) or others. This is a longer process. We're looking at sixteen days or a little over that to actually go to a contempt report on information that he knows he can't get. My question to the Chairman is why don't he go down-- why doesn't he read what's already available and then if he wants more, then work with the Department of Justice to figure this out instead of having the public show of contempt and trying to discredit Bill Barr. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Democrats would say if they look at it and can't talk about it publicly, then that's not fair. But on top of this are you disappointed that the Attorney General didn't come before your committee so you could have this conversation? REPRESENTATIVE DOUG COLLINS: I'm very disappointed that my chairman let that happen. I wanted to actually talk to Bill Barr. He had that opportunity. And the day before he was in the Senate and in the Senate for over six hours and even did a double round of questions from Democrats. Bill Barr is not afraid of testifying. Bill Barr is frankly-- has already said he will testify. He just didn't want to be part of a show in which the Democrats who have not brought up impeachment because they know they can't-- in fact, I have a question for you, Margaret. Why would you impeach a president except for the-- what is found out-- because Mueller said there was no collusion, there was no obstruction. I mean, at this point-- I mean, you-- he is-- we have the best economy we've had in years, 50 years of unemployment. What were you impeaching him for? MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to talk about that. REPRESENTATIVE DOUG COLLINS: And I think they want to make it look like impeachment. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to talk about that more with you. REPRESENTATIVE DOUG COLLINS: They want to make it look like impeachment. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to take a quick commercial break and I want to talk to you more about that on the other side of it so please stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Be sure to join us next Sunday. We'll have an interview with Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. That's next week on FACE THE NATION. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but we will be right back with more from Republican Congressman Doug Collins of Georgia.\u00a0 Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to continue our conversation with the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Georgia Congressman Doug Collins. Congressman, let's pick up where we left off. In terms of the Attorney General's testimony and the questions about the accuracy and truthfulness of his accounts to the public and Congress we now know, because it became public, that the special counsel himself wrote a letter dated March 27th saying, quote, \"There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine the central purpose for which the department appointed the special counsel to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.\" Do you want the special counsel to appear and explain exactly what he was objecting to here? REPRESENTATIVE DOUG COLLINS: We've already asked for the special counsel to come, Margaret. We did that over a month ago because we believe, you know, actually he is the fact witness here. He was the one that conducted the hearing-- the investigation over two years spending mult-- you know, well over thirty million dollars, had all the assets in place with a grand jury and everything. He's the one that is the central figure here. But the one thing he said in that letter I think is worth-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you know what he was objected-- objecting to in that letter because you seem to be defending the attorney general? REPRESENTATIVE DOUG COLLINS: Well, I think if you read the letter you see what he is concerned about. He is concerned about the public perception a la what has happened through the press on how it was-- MARGARET BRENNAN: He didn't-- REPRESENTATIVE DOUG COLLINS: --being port-- portrayed. When you-- when you look at it-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The quote was as I read it-- REPRESENTATIVE DOUG COLLINS: --what he is saying is a roll out-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --there, Sir. REPRESENTATIVE DOUG COLLINS: I read it and I read the letter as well in-- in totality in which he never disagreed with the conclusions of the attorney general. He-- the conclusions were right. And as the attorney general has said, and also Mister Mueller said in that letter, he was concerned about how it was put out. He thought there might have been more put out at a certain time, and it was the attorney general's job to actually make sure on how he was going to put that out for most of the folks in the public to see it. That was, I think, believe the difference if you take a strict reading of the letter. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. This is not the only hearing. In fact, there are many investigations, there are many subpoenas that have been issued to the administration and-- and it seems that really you're seeing an-- a head-to-head clash between the congressional branch of government and the White House on many fronts. Is the refusal to comply worrisome to you that this is setting a precedent that undermines the oversight capabilities and charge of Congress? REPRESENTATIVE DOUG COLLINS: No, it does not, because it's happened with every administration. In fact, you know, during the Obama administration there was a lot of pushback. There was always a slow walk of-- of information requested and sometimes a rescheduling of witnesses. This is something that goes on between the administration and the congressional branch at all times. Now I am very much in favor of congressional oversight, no matter who's in the White House. And we have that proper role, but there is a give and take between the two. And I believe if, especially in the regards of what we're seeing right now from our chairman, if the chairman would actually engage and then find a way to find accommodations--offer accommodations, do the things that have been done in the past, historically, instead of rushing to do a contempt or rushing to a press release or rushing to make a-- an assumption, then I think we could actually get to the oversight that we need to have on this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time this morning. We turn now to Congressman Eric Swalwell who joins us this morning from Mason City, Iowa, where he is campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination. Welcome to FACE THE NATION, Congressman. I know you are very-- REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL (D-California/Judiciary Committee/@ericswalwell): Good morning, thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are very much involved as well with these hearings and these investigations. So let's start there before we talk about your 2020 platform. This hearing that we were just talking about that the attorney general did not show up for in the center of the room, one of your Democratic colleagues put a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken and an actual chicken. It, obviously, got a lot of press attention but is this really the tone that Democrats want to set? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: Margaret, the-- the tone we want to set is to highlight that America was attacked by the Russians in 2016. The basic function of a government is to protect its people from a foreign attack and we needed the attorney general to come to Congress, a separate branch of power and tell us what the Russians did who they worked with and what we could do next. And he chose not to show up and there's going to be consequences for that. And that was highlighted by another colleague of mine. But the bigger issue here is he didn't show up. MARGARET BRENNAN: He didn't show up. They argue over these procedural arguments in regard to having other lawyers, staff lawyers, question alongside congressmen like yourself. For you, you think this is just a refusal to comply because of what? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: You know, Margaret, I don't care if we asked him to meet us here in Mason City to tell us about what the Russians did. We are a separate branch of power and we have the right to ask so we can protect the American people. And again, I think this is more about not wanting to play an away game. He had a home game with the Senate with Chairman Graham. He didn't do so well there, it looks like he lied to Congress, and he didn't want to come the next day where he would face even more tough questions. And again the bigger picture here, if we are not able to protect our people from a foreign attack do we really actually have a government that can defend us. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said-- you seem to agree with Speaker Pelosi that the attorney general lied, specifically, here. What is it that you are taking issue with? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: Well, first, he prejudged the report before he even became attorney general. I think he should have never been confirmed, but once confirmed should have recused. Second, he falsely accused the Obama administration of spying on the Trump campaign. Third, he mischaracterized at the press conference and to Congressman Christ what Bob Mueller's view was on the report. And, finally and most importantly, he missed the deadline last week to give us the full Mueller report. There have to be consequences for that. For that reason I think you have to move this obstructor out of the way and I'm recommending that we impeach Attorney General Barr so that we can get the information we need to protect our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you read all the Muller report? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: Yes. There's an eighth of it that I'm not allowed to read that I should be allowed to read. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your leadership has the ability to read it but we know that there's a-- a reason for that objection. But I want to get to the point of the-- the sweeping and systematic Russian interference that is laid out in the report is substantiated. But I know you have been talking because you are also in an intelligence role on that House committee saying a number of things that I want to quote back to you. Up until this point, you said when you were asked in January, \"Do you believe the President right now has been an agent of the Russians?\" You said, \"Yes.\" You were asked again at the end of that month by a questioner, \"I'm still not hearing any evidence that he's an agent of Russia.\" And you said, \"Yeah, I think it's pretty clear it's almost hiding in plain sight.\" The Mueller report did not substantiate any conspiracy or coordination with Russia. Do you regret prejudging the outcome? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: No, actually, I-- I think I should have been louder, considering the top of your show and you talked about the phone call between Vladimir Putin and the President, at the President's request. And-- and, Margaret, the Mueller team was not even allowed to look at the financial entanglements. So, I think it's really hard to draw a conclusion about conspiracy if they couldn't look at the President's tax returns. They couldn't look at the President's loans from the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You still believe he's an agent of Russia? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: I think he acts on their behalf. I mean, again I think ten years from, now we are going to-- we are going to look at what happened this week and we are going to say, \"Are you kidding me?\" After Russia attacked the United States, after the special counsel laid out two hundred pages of links between the Russians and the Trumps and how they tried to help him, our President instead of calling the Russian president saying, \"don't do this again,\" he talked to him for an hour and a half and said that the Russian president was smiling. I mean, that is just nutty, Margaret. That is putting the Russian's interests ahead of the United States' interests. MARGARET BRENNAN: This, along with other investigations, the administration is pushing back on. Given the level of pushback, do you think that this is stirring up enough frustration among Democrats that they might change the judgment and go ahead with impeachment? Do you support impeachment of the President? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: This President is taking us down that road. It's-- it's maybe the only road to save the country. But right now, you know, I'll-- I'll tell you with the attorney general, I think we should move to impeach him first. Now, I'm-- I'm a father of a-- a two-year-old and a six-month-old. We're going through the terrible twos. When my son misbehaves, we take a toy away. We know if we don't do that he is only going to get worse. We have a really bad kid at the White House and unless we start showing that there are consequences for their actions, he is only going to get worse and the next kid, the next President, is going to look at what we did now and judge their actions based on whether there were consequences or not. So we have to start taking this President seriously and speaking the only lan-- language they know, which is force and consequence. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're running for President. Day one, more sanctions on Russia? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: Yes. But also day one is take the oath and go on a global affirmation tour to assure our NATO allies and others that we are still with them and we need them to be a check on Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, more to talk about with you, but we're going to have to leave it there. REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: I look forward to that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Pick that conversation up-- REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: --another time. And we will be back with our political panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our political panel. Byron York is the chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner, Shawna Thomas is the Washington Bureau chief for Vice News, Rachael Bade covers Congress for The Washington Post, and Michael Crowley is the White House and national security editor at Politico. Not for long, though, because congratulations, Michael, I know you're headed to a new assignment for The New York Times to cover the White House. MICHAEL CROWLEY (Politico/@michaelcrowley): Thank you. I'm excited. Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And hope to have you back at this table. Byron, good to see you. BYRON YORK (Washington Examiner/@ByronYork): Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: The speaker of the House says that the attorney general lied under oath. Did he? BYRON YORK: I don't think so. I think you could-- if-- if you look at the text of what the attorney general said in that exchange with Representative Crist, you played it earlier, if you look at the text, Bill Barr gave an accurate and very lawyerly answer. We've seen that in Congress before. He was asked about Robert Mueller's team, about a news story that appeared in The New York Times right before about members of Mueller's team had told associates that they were unhappy with the report. Specifically, said they didn't know what Mueller himself thought. And Bob-- Bill Barr said, look, I talked to Robert Mueller himself. I don't know what his team said, and that's why I answered the question. It was not forthcoming. It was narrow, but it was not a lie. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the letter from the special counsel that became public this week underscores, it seems, at least some level of disagreement between the special counsel and the attorney general in the public portrayal. BYRON YORK: I don't think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: How do we make sense of that? BYRON YORK: Well, I don't think there is any-- any doubt about that. I think Barr would say, look, there was intense public pressure when the-- when the report was sent over to the Justice Department on March twenty-second. I had to get something out. So in a couple of days, I summarized the report's principal conclusions. I didn't characterize the whole report. Basically, he said that Mueller had found there was the evidence did not substantiate a charge of conspiracy, and that he chose not to exonerate the President on obstruction. And he included that in his letter. So, look, I think a two-page letter is not going to characterize a four-hundred-and-forty-eight-page report. SHAWNA THOMAS (Vice News/@Shawna): But what this underscores, and I think also what Barr is hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee underscores is the need to hear from Mueller. There were so many questions that Attorney General Barr got that day. And what I was struck by was they were asking him to characterize Bob Mueller's thoughts. And there was even one time where he says, I don't want to characterize Bob's thoughts about a question from a Democrat. And I think if-- if Bob Mueller is willing to speak to the Senate Judiciary Committee, to a House committee, that whole thing, he can actually answer some of these questions that Barr got. And that can help figure out, you know, was it a lie? Was it not a lie? All of those things actually sort of rest on Bob Mueller. RACHAEL BADE (Washington Post/@ rachaelmbade): There's also the saying that, you know, if you're explaining, you're losing. So maybe, you know, Barr can go out there and try to explain, well, I thought the question was this or that, but Democrats feel they definitely have enough in terms of saying he lied. And it's not just that comment, you know, he has now ignored two subpoenas from the House Democrats. He did not show up at a hearing that he was supposed to attend last week. And they have a whole list of grievances with him. And so we're going to see them, it's interesting with your interview with Swalwell, he talked about impeaching Barr. You know, the Judiciary Committee-- MICHAEL CROWLEY: --question about impeaching the President. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. RACHAEL BADE: Right, right. Well, there's this debate going on about, do we just hold Barr in contempt of Congress? Because they are going to do that. It's a matter of when, not if, but, you know, if they impeach Barr, does that make it harder for them to one day impeach the President? And there was a private conversation with some Judiciary Democrats last week where they actually debated that very thing. Can they impeach both? Or if they're going to impeach anyone, they would want to impeach the President, not Barr. So it's sort of an interesting how they handle that will be interesting to watch. MARGARET BRENNAN: Any attempt to impeach is dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate. So what does this accomplish? To people at home it just sounds like more fighting in Washington. RACHAEL BADE: Yeah. So I think with the Mueller report, the Democrats had-- the House Democrats had a call right after the Mueller report came out. And the message was still the same: Do not talk about impeachment. Well, let's talk about investigating the President. We'll keep investigating him and see where it leads. But there was a turning point I feel like last week with a lot of Democrats when the President came out and said, \"I am going to ignore all the subpoenas. That infuriated a whole bunch of Democratic investigators in the House. And that more than the Mueller report I would say has made more people start talking about impeachment. Now Pelosi is still pushing back on that, but she is feeling a lot of heat from her members right now, which I think is why you see her rhetoric become sharper and sharper accusing the President being worse than Nixon, for instance. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. RACHAEL BADE: But, you know, she's going to have to find a way to sort of calm the caucus down if she doesn't want to do impeachment, because a lot more Democrats are talking about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Michael, is it a fair question? And itself a question I put to secretary of state, I'll say that, but is it a fair question to ask why the President didn't bring this up with Vladimir Putin given that it has been discussed, they have confronted him in some way through other channels? Does-- in the wake of the Mueller report, should we have expected the President to have pushed Vladimir Putin? MICHAEL CROWLEY: Well, I wouldn't have expected it because at this point we know that the President just doesn't want to talk about this. He doesn't want to prioritize it in his relationship with Putin. And I-- I find it, although, you know, strange on some level, also utterly unsurprising. And what's more striking to me is, in general, the President's tone toward Putin is just completely unchanged. So, in other words, it's not that particular point about election interference and is he still pushing that. It's that he's still talking about trying to have a-- a good relationship with Russia, speaking in generally positive terms about Putin, kind of describing this, you know, this kind of bon ami that they have between each other, this light rapport, joking around, Putin was smiling through the telephone, that kind of strange formulation the President used. And, you know, I do wonder if there is some part of Trump that now feels that all the Russia stuff is behind us and I can get back to work on this relationship with Putin. Now, Congress has really tied his hands, made it difficult for him to change U.S. policy. There's still a lot Trump can do in terms of building relations with Putin, giving Putin more freedom around the world to act, his comments about Venezuela, although he said one thing verbally and another thing on Twitter, as Mike Pompeo pointed out, he can still make it easier for Putin to operate in Venezuela and elsewhere, places like Syria and the Middle East, if he wants to. So I would say beyond that particular question, which is very important, I am watching to see whether Trump now feels like he can resume this effort to develop some kind of relationship. And the last thing I'll say, Margaret, very quickly, is Pompeo meeting with the Russian foreign minister to tee up a potential Trump-Putin meeting-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MICHAEL CROWLEY: --at the G20 summit in Japan this summer? I think that's very possible. BYRON YORK: Can I say one thing on-- this Trump-- MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to take a break and then finish. I'll give you that thought on the other side of it. So stay with us. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with our political panel. Byron, start with you. I cut you off before the break. BYRON YORK: Well, the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: We were talking about Russia and the President's lack of confrontation with Putin. BYRON YORK: Yeah. I mean the Trump-Putin show is a recurring show. Trump has consistently refused to publicly condemn Putin. It just happens over and over and over. I think he makes a mistake every time he does that. But with Trump, as with everything else, there are always two levels going on. There's what the President says publicly and what the administration is doing. I was at a Hoover Institution event a few days ago, Stanford. Michael McFaul, who was the Obama administration's ambassador to Russia, no fan of Trump at all, said, \"I don't see a big difference between the late Obama years and the early Trump years. I see more continuity along the three big dimensions: Strengthening NATO, punishing Russia for belligerent behavior, and strengthening Ukraine.\" So there is always a two-level thing going on. And you do have to remember what the President's administration is doing against Russia in addition to what he is saying. SHAWNA THOMAS: But it also puts his administration in a weird position. I mean one of the things about Secretary Pompeo's interview with you is he had to find himself either ignoring or explaining away the President of the United States. And you're right, we see this happen over and over again and it's worth paying attention to what the administration continues to do, but what does that say to our friends, our allies, the people who don't like us around the world when the President continues to say one thing, but Secretary Pompeo and everyone else say something else. It is just confusing. And it-- it isn't-- it isn't clear. And the President's words do matter in foreign affairs. MICHAEL CROWLEY: And just one sentence on this. Now that the Mueller report is behind us and Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy at least to collude with Russia, will the President now feel more freedom to try to change U.S. policy? So that is behind us, what you just described. And I am just waiting to see what comes next. We may be in a different environment now. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I'm interested in what you said about potential meetings since the President has floated this idea of a nuclear deal with Russia and with China. So more to come on that front. Well, let's turn back here to home. Rachael, in an interview with the New York Times, Speaker Pelosi said the best plan to defeat President Trump, not to impeach him, but is to win at the ballot box in 2020 but she said own the center left, own the mainstream. Is that a message being heard? RACHAEL BADE: Yeah, it's really interesting to see Pelosi, you know, for-- for years we saw Republicans sort of paint her as this San Francisco liberal, you know, this bogeyman. And she more than any other leader in the Democratic Party is really taking a pragmatic approach to impeachment to 2020. She has pretty much put any notion of putting Medicare for All on the House floor to the side. They're having hearings on that, but she's not talking about it. She says calm down on impeachment. And this just shows the sort of cautious approach that she is taking when it comes to keeping her own majority and this fear that she has that, you know, her caucus could potentially overreach or being accused of overreaching when it comes to these investigations. And I-- it could have a blowback not only on the House but, you know, potentially giving Trump a second term, which is the last thing that she wants. I-- I also think it's interesting to look at the Republicans side, too. Because, you know, you asked Collins about if he had any concerns about precedent here-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. RACHAEL BADE: --and about Trump stonewalling all these investigations. You know, I covered-- his response was something along the lines of, oh, every administration does this. And it is true. There's always a tug-of-war between, you know, the House and-- and the White House. But I-- I covered the IRS scandal and the Benghazi investigation, and the White House, the Obama White House that hated those investigations, they gave over a ton of information. They let people do depositions. And so it's really interesting to see that Republicans don't have any concerns about precedent here, because they're actually going to be undercutting potentially themselves in the future when there is a Democrat in the White House and they regain control of the House. MARGARET BRENNAN: Byron, why isn't there more concern about that? BYRON YORK: You know I am actually a little mystified at Pelosi's behavior. She has been putting the brakes on this a lot on-- on-- on impeachment talks. She knows a lot of her base wants it. And a lot of senior Democrats, like Pelosi, believe that impeaching Bill Clinton was political suicide-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BYRON YORK: --for Republicans back in 1998. And, in fact, in 1998, Republicans thought they were going to pick up seats in the House with impeachment, and they didn't. They actually lost a few seats. But they won control of the House. And after impeaching Clinton, they won control of the House in '98, 2000, 2002, and 2004, and when they lost in 2006, it had nothing to do with Bill Clinton. And in addition, they won the White House in 2000 and 2004. Impeachment was not political suicide for Republicans, and I think actually Nancy Pelosi has a difficult case to make to her base on that. SHAWNA THOMAS: But Nancy Pelosi also says, and-- and I think this came up in that phone call that they had right after the Mueller report came out but all the Democrats were scattered throughout the country because of the recess, that some of the things we remember from-- from the Nixon situation, the hearings, John Dean talking, all that stuff, weren't impeachment hearings. They were hearings about the investigation, and they were hearings about what was going on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SHAWNA THOMAS: And that her point was we can get our version of the Mueller report out into the world, because we know lots of people aren't going to actually read it. We can do that through committee hearings. We can do that through hearings without quite going as far as impeachment when we know we are going to lose that argument in the Se-- in the Senate. So I think what she's focused on is, like, how-- what is the PR way to do this? Like, can we get all this? Can we get Mueller out in front of it? MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SHAWNA THOMAS: Can we do all that and not have to call it impeachment? RACHAEL BADE: The problem there, though, is that, you know, with the President doing the stonewalling of Congress, the Democrats, that plan is going up in smoke right now. I mean, they wanted to put Don McGahn-- SHAWNA THOMAS: Not if Bob Mueller. RACHAEL BADE: Well, Bob Mueller is one thing. And it sounds like he is going to appear before the House at some point here in the next couple of weeks, but Don McGahn, for instance, was a key witness in the Mueller investigation and, specifically, on questions of obstruction of justice. SHAWNA THOMAS: Right. RACHAEL BADE: But the White House is saying they're not going to let him appear, so that whole plan of investigating and laying it out for the public it's sort of shot right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see. The special counsel does testify. It will be much watched-- must-watch television. We will be right back with the other part of this must-watch television in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) (Ends Abruptly)",

            "article_content": "As we head into a busy week for the Iowa State Fair,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporters Musadiq Bidar and Adam Brewster\u00a0are seeing different tiers of staffing numbers for the 2020 Democratic Presidential campaigns. At least 9 campaigns have more than 35 full-time paid staffers on the ground in Iowa, not including interns and \"fellows.\" The campaigns of Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg all have more than 50 full time paid staffers. Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke all have between 35-50 full time staffers in Iowa.\u00a0 Biden has one of the larger staffs in the state, with about 75 full-time people on the ground, but other campaigns including Warren, Sanders, and Booker already had significant established operations in Iowa by the time the former vice president joined the race in late April. The late start has put the Biden campaign in place where they have to play catch up.\u00a0 \"I think that they made their job more difficult by waiting,\" said Kurt Meyer, Chair of Mitchell County Democrats. Former Iowa Democratic Party Chair Sue Dvorsky also echoed that sentiment about the Biden campaign, telling CBS News, \"you can equalize on money, you can equalize on ground game, but what you can't make up, you can't get time back. There's just no way to make time up.\" Dvorksy added that Warren had the \"earliest\" and \"most robust\" ground game in Iowa.\u00a0 Caucus-goers still have about 6 months to make up their mind on which candidate they want to support. \"People are not as likely to jump on board with campaigns as quickly,\" said Penny Rosfjord, chair of the Iowa Democratic Party's 4th Congressional District. Rosjford added that organizers will want to proceed with caution over the next few months so caucus goers are not overburdened with calls. \"It's kind of a little cat and mouse game, really, because they need to stay connected to these activists and other folks that are interested in the campaign but you can't push too hard, either.\" \u00a0 JAY INSLEE:\u00a0On Tuesday, CBS News obtained an exclusive copy of Washington Governor Jay Inslee's 10-Step Plan to halt the epidemic of White Nationalist Gun Violence, per\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry. Highlights of the plan include directing federal law enforcement resources to confront white nationalism, and creating systems to identify, track and prosecute violent white nationalists. The plan also calls for a national assault weapons ban and closing the \"Charleston Loophole,\" which allows the transfer of firearms to buyers before background checks have been completed. In a statement released by the campaign, Inslee said, \"We need a new president who will take on the twin epidemics of rising white nationalism and rising gun violence that have cost too many American lives.\" You can read Perry's write up of the plan\u00a0here. PETE BUTTIGIEG:\u00a0 The South Bend Mayor released a\u00a0plan\u00a0Tuesday aimed at combatting domestic terrorism and the gun lobby, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. The plan includes a $1 billion dollar investment to combat violent extremism. In a\u00a0Medium post, Buttigieg said the funds would be allocated to law enforcement across all agencies. Some of the funds will be dedicated to increasing the number of counterterrorism field staff at the FBI and to reinvest in the Department of Homeland Security's ability to counter and prevent extremism and hate. \"After foreign terrorist attacks, airport travelers now have to take off their shoes. After three mass shootings in a single week, Congress takes off for recess,\" Buttigieg said in a statement. \"The cycle of cut-and-paste condemnation and inaction must give way to a new approach of urgency and action.\" Buttigieg also plans to work with social media companies to track and \"limit the spread of hateful ideology\" online. In regards to gun violence prevention, Buttigieg calls for universal background checks, banning assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines and closing numerous gun loopholes. \"Weapons like the one I carried in Afghanistan have no place on our streets or in our schools \u2014 least of all in the hands of white nationalists,\" Buttigieg said in the\u00a0Medium post. Buttigieg's policy proposal also indicates his support for the creation of a national gun licensing program, allowing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to research gun violence and supporting red flag laws, which would grant judges the ability to seize guns from an owner who is a threat to themselves or others. BERNIE SANDERS:\u00a0According to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga,\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders unrolled new endorsements Tuesday from seven local leaders in New Hampshire, including refugees and representatives from the Bhutanese, Rohingya, and Congolese communities in the state: July Blaise Nganyi Imembe, Ro Mohammad Mustak, Geraldine Kirega, Surya Thapa, Krishna Nepal, Victor Mbuyi, and Rajesh Chauwan. Constituencies Director Suraj Budathoki said in a statement, \"Bernie's message of Medicare for All, a $15/hour minimum wage, tuition-free college and trade schools, and an economy that works for all of us resonates with New Americans because, like millions of immigrants and former refugees before us, we came here to build a better life for ourselves and our families.\" UP NORTH: Sganga\u00a0also reports that Concord, New Hampshire is currently coping with its own gun reform battle. Following a rally at the State Capitol yesterday, a package of gun violence prevention bills are headed to Governor Chris Sununu's desk: HB 109, closing background check loopholes; HB 514, establishing a \"waiting period\" between purchase and delivery of a firearm; and HB 564, clarifying statewide gun free schools. Democratic House Speaker Stephen Shurtleff said in a statement that he carried a gun as both Vietnam War veteran and deputy U.S. marshal, but noted, \"This is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a New Hampshire and an American issue and it's going to take all of us working together for the common good to find a solution.\" The Governor released a statement last night, writing in part, \"Like the entire nation, I was horrified by the senseless acts of hate and violence this past weekend. What we must say unequivocally is that hate, white supremacy, and acts of domestic terror have no place in New Hampshire or anywhere in this country. While we will never know all the things that lead a person to commit acts of evil, we must be mindful that the mental health crisis gripping our state and nation is a significant factor.\" NHGOP Communications Director Joe Sweeney said in a statement today, \"Democrats are disgustingly politicizing a tragedy by sending the governor these anti-Second Amendment bills immediately following terrible acts of violence in Texas and Ohio. None of these bills would have prevented those tragedies.\" MISSISSIPPI PRIMARY:\u00a0Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves heads into today's state gubernatorial primaries with two things: 1. A last minute\u00a0endorsement\u00a0from Mississippi native Brett Favre and 2. A 10-point polling lead against his most competitive GOP opponent, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Waller Jr.\u00a0 The latest\u00a0Mason-Dixie poll\u00a0has Reeves at 41 percent, but in order to get the Republican nomination, he needs at least 50 percent of the vote. A Mississippi Republican strategist familiar with the election told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0one thing to watch is how many votes go to another Republican candidate, state Rep. Robert Foster, and how much that cuts into Reeves' and Waller's percentages.\u00a0 If none of the three GOP candidates win that majority, a runoff will take place August 27. A Reeves campaign aide said they're feeling good about the primary so far but are prepared for any result -- including a runoff. For Democrats, state Attorney General Jim Hood is the front-runner and has raised over $1.3 million so far. Reeves has ignored his two other GOP candidates for most of his campaign and has centered his campaign on criticizing Hood. Tuesday's primary will help determine if the two meet in November.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power that aired Sunday, September 15, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power. She has a new memoir out, it's called \"The Education of an Idealist.\" Thank you for being here.\u00a0 FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS SAMANTHA POWER: Great to be here.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Does being an idealist survive working in the White House? POWER: Definitely, but you do have to learn how to prosecute your ideals. So the story I tell is not one of going in naive about how easy it will be to promote human rights from Washington. But I went in knowing it'd be hard and then learned how to build coalitions, learned how to work with other countries to fight things like the Ebola epidemic or get political prisoners out of jail. But you do have to keep learning and be self-critical as you go and that's a story I tell. MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Rice, you heard her just there, lay out a number of things she said were very similar between President Trump and President Obama in terms of responding to this strong reaction against military intervention. This idea that, you know, the system needs to be completely changed and that allies aren't shouldering more of the burden. Do you see those same similarities? POWER: We could not be more different, in fact. It's true that in the wake of the disastrous invasion of Iraq and the overstretch and the militarization of our foreign policy after 9/11 generally, that there is a fatigue in the country. That part I agree with. But there is a major difference between the current approach of attacking our democratic institutions at home, undermining our ability to lead internationally, attacking our allies, cozying up to abusive regimes, alienating everybody so if you need them in the face of a crisis it's going to be very hard to pick up the phone and actually get people to come into your coalitions. A big difference between that which is the present and what we did which was strengthen our alliances- yes, call on allies to do more. The United States can't share the- can't shoulder the burden alone. Absolutely that is the case. But you can do so in a manner that still preserves the relationships, deepens the relationships and ensures that when you go and try to end the- Iran's nuclear program, you get not only the European allies at the table with you but also Russia and China for all of the difficulties there. When you go and try to broker an agreement to curb climate change, you go first to China and are actually able to forge that agreement and then you take it global and bring other countries on board and you're able to build a 78 nation coalition to defeat ISIS, which is something that President Trump has carried through. But he couldn't build that coalition today. There's no way after the reckless foreign policy that's been pursued. MARGARET BRENNAN: You built your career, you won a Pulitzer Prize, around talking about human rights law, in particular genocide. And you're clear in your book that you morally had some problems with president--\u00a0 POWER: And strategically.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --and strategically, but with President Obama's decision not to strike Syria in the wake of those devastating chemical weapons attacks. General Mattis called that the shot not heard around the world. Why didn't you resign? POWER: Well first of all, in the book what I tried to do is bring readers into the situation room so they see just the complexity of decisions like that one. And when you are in the situation room and you're looking at the deaths of fourteen hundred people, and you're seeing refugee flows out of Syria that have the capacity, as they would go on to do, to destabilize countries, not just Syria itself. You see five-hundred thousand lives ultimately taken in Syria. There are a whole set of imperatives that grow out of that. At the same time, the U.S. Congress would not support President Obama when he went to them and said, \"Hey, let's do this together, let's make sure that Assad can't wait us out-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. POWER: --and just start gassing again, and then we're in a position where we're have- where we're divided domestically.\" So our foreign policy is going to be stronger if we can heal some of these divisions at home. And without that kind of base for acting internationally, especially when it comes to the use of military force, I think President Obama- again, I happen to take a different position but- but ultimately it is very hard to be a leader when the rug is being pulled out from you, particularly by the opposition party. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Assad has now essentially won that war? POWER: He has absolutely consolidated control over territory. But it's not the case necessarily, when you ask why I didn't resign, and I go into that at length in the book because a lot of people asked me that at the time.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean people ask the question now about the Trump administration, on matters of principle, why continue to serve and not resign if you object? POWER: Well again, I would- I would draw distinctions between locking children up in cages and so forth and making, I think, a reasonable decision that U.S. military force alone would not have brought the war to an end. I thought, perhaps in the wake of the gas attack, we could catalyze diplomacy. It was a limited strike of the kind that I- I thought would not lead to entanglement. President Obama agreed, he was pursuing military force. And again, Congress did not support him in that regard reflecting, I think, the larger skepticism among the American people. But what I show in the book is how much good you can do from these jobs. And I was really fortunate to be a member of the president's cabinet, to be able to launch a campaign to get female political prisoners out of jail and to actually succeed in getting them out of jail, to be able to build a coalition on- with President Obama and Secretary Kerry to end the Ebola epidemic in West Africa when people had predicted that more than 1 billion people would die. So one, you know, we are divided as Secretary Rice indicated. The reason I chose to tell a very personal story was to open up just how meaningful this work can be and to show again, the complexity of decisions and to show that not everything is as binary and gets at the sort of \"gotcha\" politics that we have today. That there are good flesh and blood people inside government, inside of public institutions generally who are trying to make the world better and who do in fact succeed. MARGARET BRENNAN: You helped shepherd through the Paris Climate Change accord which now every Democrat running for president says they're going to rejoin. But you- you also say that's not sufficient to meet the level of threat, right now. So what else needs to happen? POWER: Well, first and foremost we have to meet the commitments that we made in the Paris Agreement. I mean one of the things President Obama did was had us bring the Paris Agreement into law, international law quicker than any international climate or environmental agreement ever, worried that in case the November 2016 election-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. POWER: --went a different way then the agreement itself would collapse. So the agreement still exists globally but the commitments we made were a floor and everybody was very clear on that. So we've got to get into it, meet our commitments and then be much more ambitious in terms of what we do domestically and critically and this is why U.S. leadership is so catalytically important. We leverage the commitments we make, the sacrifices we make, to get other countries to do far more. That's how the global system works when it does. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, it's a personal memoir. You talk a lot about being a- a working woman and the challenges of being pregnant and juggling all that at the same time, it's a good read-- POWER: To which you can relate. MARGARET BRENNAN: It- it was a good read. POWER: Thank you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for joining us. We'll be back in a moment with a look at how Americans view climate change.",

I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION. A week after two mass shootings that killed thirty-one and wounded fifty-four, anger over gun violence and the motivations behind it is at a boiling point across the country. CROWD (in unison): Enough is enough. MARGARET BRENNAN: And especially on the campaign trail. JOE BIDEN: Who in God's name needs a weapon that can handle a hundred rounds? For God's sake. MARGARET BRENNAN: Despite the accusations about who's to blame for inflaming the hate that prompted them-- KAMALA HARRIS: People say to me, did Donald Trump cause those-- those folks to be killed? Well, no, of course, he didn't pull the trigger, but he certainly been tweeting out the ammunition. MARGARET BRENNAN: --there are sober reminders that gun violence touches all, even presidential candidates. STEPHANIE: My beautiful four-year-old daughter Dayla was struck by a stray bullet March, 2011. My son, my daughter's twin brother, witnessed what happened that day. She died two days later. ANDREW YANG: I have a six- and three-year-old boy. I was imagining-- I was imagining it was one of them that got shot and the other saw it. I'm so sorry. PETE BUTTIGIEG: El Paso Walmart, El Paso, Texas. Oregon historic district, Dayton, Ohio. These are less than half of the mass shootings in my lifetime. It is time to do something different. MARGARET BRENNAN: But after years of failing to get gun control measures passed on a national level, what bill that's different could get through Congress and get signed by the President? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But we have to have meaningful background checks. I'm talking about meaningful. Add that word, meaningful. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll hear from all sides. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg hosted a candidate forum Saturday in Iowa to push for gun control. We spoke with him there. Red flag laws, those were in place in Connecticut before Sandy Hook. They didn't stop that massacre-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: No, but they stopped some things-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --background checks would not have stopped these two shooters from getting these guns. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: Okay. That is true. No one law is going to stop everything. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with the number two Republican in the House, Louisiana's Steve Scalise. He was critically injured when a gunman attacked Republican members of Congress during a baseball practice in 2017. We'll also hear from three presidential candidates, Senators Bernie Sanders, Michael Bennet, and Kirsten Gillibrand. And as always, we'll have political analysis on all the news of the week coming up on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin with the question on everyone's minds a week after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio: What can be done to prevent these in the future? Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who founded the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, hosted a candidate forum in Des Moines yesterday. We spoke with him there and began by asking if he thinks Congress will pass a background check bill when they return in the fall. (Begin VT) MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (Former New York City Mayor/@MikeBloomberg): I'm optimistic. It still depends on Mitch McConnell bringing a bill to the floor in the Senate and it still depends on the President of the United States signing a bill. I think that the more you see things like this event where-- if I'd done this ten years ago we wouldn't have gotten any Democratic candidates for President to come. Today, almost all the twenty are here. That they see the public has said enough is enough and that's why we're here. And that's-- the impact is not just on the Democratic Party, which you may well remember the Democrats were cowed by the NRA as well for a long time although today, in all fairness, they're not. It's the time is to say we just have to stop this. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said that when you launched this group, that just like the NRA, we need to make them afraid of us. That is going out there and challenging politicians who don't support this kind of platform. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: What I did in the 2018 election was we supported twenty-four candidates for Congress. The criteria were they had to be good on guns and good on the environment. MARGARET BRENNAN: You spent about a hundred million dollars. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: Spent about a hundred million dollars and twenty-one of the twenty-four won and replaced \"A\"-rated Congress people from the NRA, NRA \"A\" rated. The NRA takes no prisoners whatsoever and they lost twenty-one seats in the House. Flipped the House. And so now is the time to start working and helping the Republicans to see the light because I don't think this is a partisan issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what does this mean for 2020? Are you going to go out there and fund candidates to challenge those who-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: We'll see. MARGARET BRENNAN: --don't fund or vote for things like background checks or red flag laws? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: It is very early and the best thing would be that we have action in Congress on the Republican Senate side as well as the Democratic House side, so that you won't be able to ask that question because we will already be where we want to be. MARGARET BRENNAN: But is this a-- a threat or warning from you? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: There's no question that I think this is one of the real key issues in our country. We cannot have a society where you go out in the street and you can get blown away. It's just not tolerable. We-- we just have to say enough is enough. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said that, essentially, the NRA model, of taking people directly on if they are not supporting your platform should be replicated-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: I think that should be-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --if-- if Mitch McConnell doesn't-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: --but if everything-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --bring this to the floor in the fall, will you look at funding his-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: Mitch-- MARGARET BRENNAN:--opposition? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: --Mitch McConnell is up for re-election, and he's running against somebody who I'm told is an attractive candidate. Mitch McConnell is going to look and say, \"What does the public want as well?\" So I am optimistic that even Mitch will change his mind. I hope so. MARGARET BRENNAN: Red flag laws. Those were in place in Connecticut before Sandy Hook. They didn't stop that massacre-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: No, but they stopped some things-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --background checks would not have stopped these two shooters from getting these guns, at least as currently written. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: Okay. That is true. No one law is going to stop everything, but there's just no question when you put in background checks, suicides with-- with guns and murder rates go down. When you get rid of assault weapons you stop the mass murders. These are not public health things. This is too much of a access to-- to-- to guns and particularly to assault weapons, which were designed to kill the maximum number of people as quickly as possible, and as gruesomely as you could possibly do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: The NRA has been having some internal disputes and problems. They were the largest donor to-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: I noticed that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --to President Trump-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: --what a shame. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in 2016. Will they be able to bankroll to the level they did in 2020? I mean-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --do you see an opportunity? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: I think the NRA has been very badly hurt by this. The NRA-- ninety percent of NRA members are in favor of background checks. So the NRA is not in the place of most of its members. And, in fact, if you go back you can see Wayne LaPierre, who runs the NRA, testifying before Congress in favor of background checks fifteen or twenty years ago. WAYNE LAPIERRE (1999): We think it's reasonable to provide for instant gun checks at shows, just like at gun stores and pawn shops. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: They've changed their views. They went towards-- away from background checks. The time is for them to come back. And if they want to be an organization rent-- representing gun owners, that's fine, nothing wrong with that. But we-- they should not be somebody representing the view that everybody has the right to go kill everybody. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I-- I want to ask you about some of the choices the candidates are making. Joe Biden has said the President encourages white supremacism. Bernie Sanders said the President's a racist. Elizabeth Warren said he is stirring up racial conflict. Beto O'Rourke said he is making the risk of violence like this in El Paso more real. Do you think that it's a mistake for Democrats to tie the President's rhetoric to these mass killings? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: No, I think words matter. People look to their leadership for guidance and to say that it doesn't have an effect is wrong. So what the President says is very important. And if he supports or says nice things about racists, it encourages racism. If he goes and says nice things about white supremacists, he encourages that kind of violence. He's just-- I hope he understands this. He cannot go and just have-- shoot off his mouth and say anything, he's the President of the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: You decided not to run for President. Is there anything that would make you reconsider? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: No, I don't think so. I thought about it a little bit when I was driving into Des Moines today thinking, you know, I've thought-- had-- I came here and I spent a good chunk of a month meeting the people of this great state and in some senses I miss being on the campaign trail. I ran-- I had three elections. I won them all. I know how to put together a team-- I know how to put together a team not just to win elections, I know how to put together a team to actually deliver the services you promise. But I did that, and now it's time to do something else. MARGARET BRENNAN: Can Democrats win if they bill themselves as progressives? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: I think if you are very progressive, no. I think the public wants evolutionary change, not revolutionary change. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that Democrats need a new generation? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: I think there's an awful lot to be said for experience and accomplishment. There's a value to having been there, done that, and to understand if there was simple solutions to complex problems we would have solved those problems. I'm not a believer that, oh, there's a new generation coming along and they own the right to set the agenda. I think you earn your spurs, and you earn the right to set an agenda by showing people that what you've been doing is working. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have business in China and you know-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --business people for decades have been complaining about China not playing fair. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: That's correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump's been really aggressive-- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: --on this. You don't like the tactics, but is he doing what is needed on this front? And how do Democrats say that they are going to be stronger? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: People that think Donald Trump will have-- is not re-electable are wrong. I think a lot of people look at exactly what he is doing with China and they think he's at least taking on the Chinese and they should be taken on is their belief. Now I would argue some of the things he says are right, that we really shouldn't have this asymmetrical trade relationship. But you don't do it by walking up and having public fights. You don't do it by changing your mind all the time. You don't do it by being a bully with tariffs. So it's the President's methods of trying to deal with China that I object to, not the fact that they have-- the Chinese have their interests, we have ours. MARGARET BRENNAN: You think he may be re-elected? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: I hope not. I will, I'm sure, support somebody who's running against him in the end. But I think-- to anybody that thinks that he does not have support is badly misinterpreting what the public believes. There is a revolution that has been taking place around the world where the public thinks that the establishment has not recognized their needs. And you see that in Donald Trump getting elected. You see that in Brexit. You see that in a lot of things where we're doing things differently and the old line stuff is being thrown out and that's not necessarily good. MARGARET BRENNAN: Our full interview with Mayor Bloomberg is available on our website, facethenation.com. We did invite the NRA's Wayne LaPierre to appear on the broadcast, but he declined our invitation. We now turn to the number two Republican in the House, Steve Scalise. He joins us this morning from New Orleans. Good morning, Congressman. REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE (R-Louisiana/@SteveScalise/Republican Whip): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump says he wants meaningful background checks. Why aren't you supporting him on that? REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, first of all, I have supported him on that. And, in fact, we got a bill to President Trump's desk last year, the Fix NICS bill, which truly does go after some of the real problems we saw where people were falling through the cracks and not getting into the background-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But, he wanted something new and now. REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: --check system, like so many shootings, like Charleston, like others. Well, the President said he wants to make sure especially that people with mental illnesses don't get guns. And, in fact, there were a lot of people that we were finding that weren't getting put into the system. We need to keep working on that and make the background check system work better. We passed a very bipartisan bill to do just that, and Donald Trump signed it into law just last year. Let's focus on making that work better so a lot of these people that slip through the cracks don't-- don't slip through the cracks again or in future attempts where they might try to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean that you do not expect Republicans to support or vote for new legislation on background checks? REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, first of all, let's see what bills are being brought forward. I know what Nancy Pelosi called for the Senate to come back and vote on, was a bill that they passed through the House, or two bills, that wouldn't have actually done anything to stop these shootings because the shooters in-- in both in El Paso and in Dayton, passed background checks. So her bill wouldn't apply to them, but her bill is very dangerous in a number of ways of how it stops law-abiding people from being able to transfer guns, including if you loan your gun to your neighbor because she's afraid that her ex-boyfriend is going to come and beat her up. You loaning your gun to her would put you in federal-- in-- not in federal-- put you in prison for up to a year. That's what Pelosi's bill does. Wouldn't have stopped the shootings, but actually makes it harder for law-abiding citizens to do things that are currently legal and, frankly, currently helping improve safety. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think domestic terrorism should be a federal crime? REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: I do, and in fact I applaud what's being done both at the FBI and with our new acting homeland security secretary. His first week in office he put in place a task force to go look at a lot of the online recruiting that's going on to radicalize people. We're seeing a very alarming increase in domestic terrorism. The FBI has been focused on that. Last month alone they saw it was in the hundreds, the number of domestic terrorism cases that they're looking at. So we need to make sure that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have the tools they need to go and root out whether it's white supremacists, whether it's radicals from the left that are committing some of these crimes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what tools-- REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: We need to make sure that they-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --do you think Republicans-- REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: --have the tools they need to root it out. MARGARET BRENNAN: What tools will Republicans vote to give law enforcement? What-- what are you suggesting there? REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, first of all, if you look at what the FBI just set up recently and what the Homeland Security secretary just did recently to put a renewed focus on this, to put a new focus on what's going on online, the recruiting that we all know has been going on online. They are actually focusing on it. They do need more tools. They've asked for more resources. We have a budget process that's coming up when we return in September. Let's make sure that in the budget process that is a very high priority because right now it's not a high enough priority. We need to make sure it is. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll have to wait till the fall to see what comes up. But I do want to ask you because you've voiced some concern about tone and conversation about these killings in this country. In the case of El Paso, it is the largest anti-Latino attack this country has ever seen. The killer said that he went to a border town to kill Mexicans. Given this particular context, can you understand the sensitivity to language used by the President when he refers to migrants as invading this country? REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, first of all, I-- I-- my heart breaks as everybody's does when you see what happened. There's no place for it, whether it's somebody that's racist that-- that hates a certain ethnic group. There's no place for those kind of attacks and attacking people based on-- on their ethnicity. But to try to assign blame to somebody else I think is a very slippery slope because the President's no more responsible for that shooting as your next guest, Bernie Sanders, is for my shooting. And he's not, by the way, responsible, the shooter is responsible. What we need to do is find out those people that have slipped through the cracks, and we've seen it in shooting after shooting; Sutherland Springs, Charleston, even in Dayton. He had a hit list and a rape list and, yet, none of that was in the system. Let's make sure these background check systems work properly and are rooting out the people that shouldn't be able to legally purchase a gun but currently are because the system hasn't worked. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have not advised the President to reconsider some of his words that many in the Hispanic community consider inflammatory? REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, first of all, the President was very clear just the other day that there's no place for this. He spoke out against racism; he spoke out against these kind of attacks. And so to try to assign blame, you know, go look at some of these presidential candidates who made some of the most ridiculous statements. I mean Joe Biden just said that he was vice president when the Parkland kids-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: --came and met with him, he wasn't vice president. You know, so some of these things that are being said are-- are beyond ridiculous. I-- I know they're running for President, and they might not like Donald Trump's views, but stop this-- this ridiculous assessment of blame to somebody other than the person who's responsible. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And again, you know, just-- just-- you talk to-- to other people who were motivators--look at the Dayton shooter and what his motivations were. Is anybody asking about that? Anybody from the left-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: --who he was inspired by. There's no right-- there's no place for it. The shooter's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're-- REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: --responsible. Let's try to identify these shooters in a better way which right now we're working on doing; let's put more emphasis there. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to give you a chance to respond to what Mayor Bloomberg said about the NRA. He said, \"It should be a group allowed to represent the gun lobby, but not to represent the view that everybody has the right to go kill everybody.\" Do you think the NRA is out of touch with some of its members who do support background checks and that it's been weakened? REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, first of all, you know, the NRA has millions of supporters and-- and people that are actual members just like any other group that can advocate for an issue. They're advocating for something that's in the United States Constitution: the Second Amendment. But let's look at some of the things that Michael Bloomberg has talked about. You know, he says he wants a better background check system, yet, every single person that he defeated last year, that he spent over-- about a hundred million dollars of his money to defeat, voted to fix the background check system last year. So what's his real motivation? I mean he, literally, spent about a hundred million dollars of his money for members of Congress who voted yes to fix the background system and close the background check system and close these loopholes. So-- so, again, I mean I-- I'm sure he says certain things, but what is his real motivation when he spent that much money to defeat people who voted to fix this system? And, by the way, Margaret, name one single bill that Nancy Pelosi put on Barack Obama's desk when they had the House, Senate, and the White House to address any of these issues. There was not one bill she put on his desk. We've put a bill on Donald Trump's desk last year to fix the NICS system, the background check system, and he signed it into law and is actually working to make it address those loopholes, the people that fell through the cracks, and he banned bump stocks, which were used in the Las Vegas shooting. Those by the way were legalized when Barack Obama was President. Donald Trump is the one who said this shouldn't happen. He banned bump stocks, and they're not legal anymore. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Scalise, thank you for joining us. We'll be back in one minute with Senator Bernie Sanders. He's standing by live in Iowa. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on to campaign 2020, Senator Bernie Sanders joins us from the campaign trail in Greenfield, Iowa. Senator, good morning.  SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont/@BernieSanders/2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to give you a chance to respond to Congressman Scalise who brought up the fact that the man who shot him back in 2017 had been a volunteer for your campaign. He said he doesn't blame you and, therefore, by the same token no one should blame President Trump for the shootings that we've seen in the past few days. How do you respond? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Look, as-- as soon as I possibly could I was on the floor of the Senate condemning that action. What we are is a nonviolent, political movement. I condemn all forms of violence. You know we had thirteen million people voting for us and I'm afraid I can't just tell you that every one of them was the kind of people-- kind of person that I would like. But we must bring about the fundamental changes that this country requires in health care, in education, in climate change. We do it in an absolutely nonviolent way. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you believe, and in some of your language in recent days, you-- you've said President Trump is a racist, you've called him a xenophobe. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe he is directly or indirectly responsible for what happened in El Paso?  SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: He create-- look. President Trump and nobody else wants to see people mowed down and killed, and I've never said that. He does not want to see that. But I think what he has created in this country with his incredible rhetoric, his racist rhetoric, where he calls Mexicans rapists and criminals, where he almost condones-- when in-- in a rally when somebody was attacking somebody he said, I'll pay the legal bills for violence. I think he creates a climate where we are seeing a significant increase in hate crimes in this country-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --hate crimes against Muslims, against Mexicans, against Jews. He is creating the kind of divisiveness in this nation that is the last thing that we should be doing. So he creates the climate. But do I think that he wants to see somebody get shot? Absolutely not. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect that Republican leadership, when they come back in the fall, will bring any kind of gun control legislation to the floor? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, Margaret, I certainly hope so because this is what the American people want. The American people are sick and tired of powerful corporate interest determining what goes on in Washington. You know that's whether it's the health care industry, whether it is the fossil fuel industry, whether it is the NRA. Poll after poll shows that, overwhelmingly, the American people want to expand-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --background checks. They want to do away with the gun show loophole. They want to do away with the straw man provision. And more and more people agree with something that I have been saying for thirty years, is that assault weapons are weapons of war, they are military style weapons designed to kill people-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --as rapidly as possible. They should not be sold and distributed in this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, we're going to take a quick break and continue our conversation on the other side of it. So don't go away, and we have a lot more to talk about. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up in our next half hour, we'll have two more Democratic presidential candidates in addition to more of our conversation with Bernie Sanders. Colorado Senator Michael Bennet and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand are both in Des Moines, Iowa. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Senators Sanders, Gillibrand, and Bennet and our political panel. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're back now with Senator Bernie Sanders who joins us from Greenfield, Iowa. Senator, I want to pick up where we left off on the issue of gun control. You said now you do support more efforts to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. But you have in the past been skeptical of federal gun control. You voted against the Brady Bill in '03 and '05. You voted for a law to shield gun manufacturers. And I'm wondering how you explain your change of heart. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think, first of all, for thirty years, I have been advocating for the ban on assault weapons. Year after year I have an F voting record from the NRA. I think the last one was a D minus, and as President I'm confident that I'll have an F minus. The world has changed in thirty years, and even in rural states like my state of Vermont, which until last year I had virtually no gun control. The people of this country are sick and tired of seeing the horrific mass murders that we have been seeing year after year, most recently, in Dayton and El Paso. And the American people want us to stand up to the NRA. The American people want strong gun control legislation. I have demanded that Mitch McConnell do the right thing, do what the American people want, bring us back to Washington right now. Let's pass what was passed in the House, let us go further. So to answer your question, Margaret, over the last thirty years the world has changed. It has changed in rural states like mine and it has changed all over this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you protect civil liberties and do things, like Congressman Scalise advocated, which is giving law enforcement more tools to root out those who might carry out these killings? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, it's not only giving law enforcement more tools. We have got to do a lot better job than we are doing right now in fighting the rise of white nationalism in this country. We need to understand that in El Paso what was committed was an act of domestic violence, and we need to be much more aggressive than the Trump administration has in-- in going after those people. So, I am a strong civil libertarian. But, on the other hand, I want to make sure that we do not see the rise of neo-fascism in this country and that we understand that those white nationalists are, in fact, when they get involved in violence they are terrorists and they should be treated as terrorists. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you support red flag laws? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, I do. I do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. All right. Senator, thank you for joining us from the trail. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Colorado Senator Michael Bennet. He joins us from the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. Good morning, Senator. It looks like a lot of fun there right behind you. SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET (D-Colorado/2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate/@MichaelBennet): Good morning. It is unbelievably fun. We actually just finished singing the \"Star Spangled Banner.\" Everybody stopped and put their hand on their heart and sang it together. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, you tweeted this week that if you are elected you promise voters that they won't have to think about you for at least two weeks. Is it a hard strategy to try to get people to be passionate about being moderate? SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: I think that people are so sick and tired of waking up in Donald Trump's reality TV show. I think they're sick of a President who is dividing us. I mean, it's very clear what he is trying to do. He acquired power by dividing the American people against themselves. He is trying to hold onto the power by doing the same thing and every day he just tries to keep the reality TV show alive. I think Americans want to go on with their lives. They want to build their businesses, they want to raise their children, they don't want to wake up, you know, feeling like we're on the cusp of some crazy new thing with North Korea or Iran or-- or that-- you know, the President is tweeting out conspiracy theories about somebody who killed themselves in New York. They want-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: --a President who is actually doing their job so they can do their job confident that we leave the country in a better place for our kids and grandkids and-- and-- and confident that we've situated America's leadership in this world again. So that's what I meant by that. I think that people can check in every two weeks and see how I'm doing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Colorado, where you're from, is the state that has a lot of gun-- gun owners, but it's also experienced horrific gun violence. And they've made some changes at the state level. Is that, essentially, what the country should be talking about because it doesn't seem that anything gets through Congress right now? SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: I-- I think that is what we should be talking about. You know, my oldest daughter is nineteen. She was born the year after the Columbine massacre happened in-- in my state. And my state--which is a Western state, the Second Amendment state--we passed the background checks that are waiting for Mitch McConnell to put on the floor this summer. And over that course of that almost twenty years about every year, about two or three percent of the people that try to buy a gun in Colorado can't buy a gun; and they are murderers and they are domestic abusers and they are convicted felons of violent crimes. There is nobody who could defend any of those people having a firearm. If we can do it in Colorado, certainly, we could do it nationally. We have-- we have-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't expect that to happen in September? SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: --put limitations-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't expect to vote on background check? SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: Well, I hope that it will happen. I-- I hope it will happen. But I believe with what-- I believe what Mike Bloomberg said earlier on your show, which is that the politics of this issue are changing in part because the tragedies are mounting up which is a terrible way for us to deal with it. But also because the public is being galvanized by organizations like the-- the kids from Parkland and the Moms against Guns, and that's making a difference. And if it does not come to the floor, we need to make sure that every week between now and November we're making this a voting issue. I'm not saying just the politicians. I mean all of us are making this a voting issue so that people that refused to let the American people have a vote on the floor are turned out and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: --replaced with people who will take the vote. MARGARET BRENNAN: You-- SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: I mean, we're not even-- like, Mc-- McConnell can vote however he wants. But why doesn't he just put it on the floor so that every senator could be held accountable for their vote? MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been talking about ending hyper-partisanship. Do you think it is helpful for Democrats and your fellow candidates to be linking the President to these mass murders? SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: Well, I'd-- I-- I-- here's what I think. I think Donald Trump is, as I said, has a strategy that is a-- to-- to divide the country so he can win. He believes there are enough people out there. He thinks it's thirty-eight or thirty-nine or forty percent-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: --that can keep him in office if the rest of us are not paying attention and not-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: --as strategic. And I don't think we can play into that. We have to unify this country. That is what the people of Iowa want-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: --the people of Colorado want, in South Carolina and New Hampshire. We have to unify this country to close over a broken Washington and to close over a President who is a guy who is, you-- you know, goes to our worst impulses rather than our best impulses every single day of the year. We have both in our country. We've got the best impulses-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: --with times we have our worst impulses. I think we should have a President who asks us to do our best. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: And I think we have to have a President who asks us to come together. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator, thank you. And I think I hear a child behind you, so nice focus. SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: There are-- it's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a fair. SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: It's not my child though, so. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. All right. Well, good luck to the parents. All right. Thank you-- SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: Thank you for-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --very much, Senator. SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: Thanks so much. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with-- SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET: Thanks, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --another 2020 candidate. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We are back with New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. She joins us this morning from the campaign trail in West Des Moines. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-New York/2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate/@SenGillibrand): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: You support universal background checks, a ban on large magazine and assault weapons, and an anti-gun trafficking law. You need Republican votes to get all those things through Congress, what can actually pass now? SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: You know I think things are changing since kids have been marching out of their schools and marching on Washington and are really demanding action. You've seen a level of advocacy that I've never seen before. And I think if Mitch McConnell would have the courage to call us back into Washington to vote, we would pass the universal background checks bill that's already passed the House and we would pass the bill that I wrote which is anti-gun trafficking which the last time we voted on it got fifty-eight votes. We only needed sixty. So we're only two votes shy and I believe we have the momentum and the advocacy behind us today to pass that as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about red flag laws? Your colleague in New York, Chuck Schumer, has said they are ineffective cop outs. SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I think you can pass a red flag law, but it's insufficient. What we really need to do is also pass a ban on assault weapons, particularly, the military-style weapons that have resulted in people losing their lives within seconds and then the large magazines. MARGARET BRENNAN: Many of your Republican colleagues would agree on red flags being insufficient. They also don't think background checks necessarily would be. The argument is for more tools for law enforcement. So, do you support making domestic terrorism a federal crime and would you sign on to Dick Durbin's bill to increase resources to combat it? SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Absolutely. And as President I would direct my Department of Justice to investigate white supremacy and other domestic terrorist groups to infiltrate them, to make sure we know if they're planning attacks, and to absolutely combat white supremacy in society because these groups are domestic terrorists. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when talking about white supremacy, you and some of your colleagues and competitors have been linking the President's rhetoric to emboldening white supremacists. You said, \"He is emboldening white supremacists his entire presidency and his campaign.\" Are you actually saying that President Trump is responsible for the killings in El Paso and Ohio? SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: What I'm saying is that his words have consequences and the words he has been using have been hateful and divisive and racist and has truly emboldened white supremacy and hate crimes across this country. Since President Trump's been elected hate crimes have increased--certainly, across my state and across the country--against all groups. More racism, more anti-Semitism, more white supremacy, more anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-refugees. And it's changing who we are as a nation. And that's one of the reasons I am running for President. We need a President-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but in terms of that-- SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: --who will bring us back together again. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in terms of the name-calling and putting it in the political context, don't you think that is ratcheting up the rhetoric rather than having cooler heads prevail? SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: What President Trump has done is ratchet up the rhetoric. When he's at a rally in Florida and someone says \"what are you going to do with immigrants,\" and someone shouts \"kill them, shoot them,\" President Trump laughed. So he is not leading us in the right direction. He has used words like infestation. He's used words like invasion. That is creating a climate where people are-- literally, today fueled by anger and hate. They are hunting down other people using weapons of war. That's what we're up against right now. And President Trump will not stand up to the NRA; will not stand up to the gun-- gun manufacturers-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what about-- but-- but-- SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: --to get these guns off the streets. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what about, though, what Joaquin Castro--the congressman--did this week with publishing the names of some of President Trump's top donors? It's publicly available information, but some would say he was targeting these individuals. Is that helpful or is that dangerous given what you're describing? SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Those are his choices, not mine. I will call out racism when I see it. I will call out white supremacy when I see it. I will call out hate and I will stand up against it in every form. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about New York financier, Jeffrey Epstein. He is an accused child molester, pedophile, sex trafficker. He committed suicide while in federal custody. The FBI and IG are investigating. Do you think the U.S. government has failed his victims? SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Well, I am concerned. These survivors deserved a day in court, they deserved justice. They deserved to speak out against this perpetrator, and it is a shame that he committed suicide. I do think there needs to be a full investigation about why he was taken off the terror watch, excuse me, why he was taken off the suicide watch list. I think it's a strange decision given that he attempted suicide once already. I want to know why he was left in a circumstance where suicide was even possible. I think it needs a full investigation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Gillibrand, thank you. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We are back now with our political panel. Jerry Seib is the executive Washington editor for the Wall Street Journal and Shawna Thomas is the Washington bureau chief for Vice News. Out in the field this morning our CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, who is still out at the Iowa State Fair. Ed, tell me, you-- you've been listening to all the candidates out there speak about promising some kind of gun control, either now or if they're elected. Is there any chance any of it gets through? ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): You know, Margaret, I have been covering this issue in one way or another for six or seven years, since Sandy Hook, essentially. We go through a week of this, we hit a weekend, and-- and then it's-- it's struggles to sustain itself, the debate. And that's one of the things I am very curious to watch in the next few days is can this issue get into its second week since a big mass shooting and sustain itself? There is some evidence that at least here in Iowa, a critical early caucus state, that it might. Just a little while ago Julian Castro, one of the candidates who spends a lot of time here, said that this Wednesday he'll be holding a forum with members of that organization that held the larger forum yesterday here in Des Moines to talk, specifically, about his gun violence plan and ways to somehow curb violence across the country. It will happen in a small bedroom community that is popular with younger families, young couples out in Eastern Iowa. If that organization can continue to hold those kinds of events with candidates over the course of the next six months here and in New Hampshire and in South Carolina and other states, maybe it does sustain itself. But when that congressional debate happens in September, if it happens at all, I suspect it's going to look very similar to what's happened before. Promises of action that fall apart over the details and the concerns from either party-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ED O'KEEFE: --that they may be giving away too much. MARGARET BRENNAN: Shawna, our CBS News polling shows that there-- there is some data to back up what the candidates are saying in terms of shifting public sentiment. Six out of ten Democrats polled by CBS say they want things like background checks. Majority of Republicans and Democrats are open to more action on this front. But what's different this time is always the question? SHAWNA THOMAS (Vice News/@Shawna): I think that's a good question. It is really hard not to be a little bit cynical. Sandy Hook, twenty kids died. They weren't able to do all of that much afterwards. I think the difference is, one, the NRA doesn't have as much money as they used to. And, two, there are Republicans who are trying to engage in this conversation. There's only so many times people can die. And I do think the President saying, okay, let's talk about background checks, now, we don't know if he's going to actually follow through with that, always hard to tell with this President, and then hearing McConnell say on the radio, Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell say on the radio, okay, we can maybe have this conversation when we come back, at least that's happening, but, remember, when-- when Manchin and Toomey had their bill that was a smaller bill about background checks. After Sandy Hook, there were four Republicans voted for it in the Senate, two of those Republicans are not in the Senate anymore. So the question is: How much money does the NRA raise out of this and how scared are Republicans to actually have this conversation? MARGARET BRENNAN: And we didn't hear from Congressman Scalise, who is the whip, really any promise of anything that would be voted for. He seemed to say there are a lot of tools already there that just need to be used better by law enforcement. GERALD SEIB (The Wall Street Journal/@GeraldFSeib): Yeah. So I think the question is very much open--will attention stay on this issue as it suggested or is that the circus move on to the next town. One of the things that might be different to your point is that for years and years, the passion on the gun issue was on the pro gun side, not the people who favored gun control. People who wanted guns or more passionate about that issue than the other side. That might have switched in 2018. I think we'll find out now for sure whether that's the case or not. But this is not really a complicated equation. This comes down to two men; this comes down to President Trump and to Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate. He says he will not bring up a bill on the Senate that the President won't sign. So will the President convince people he wants a background bill that he will sign? That's the only question that really matters in a sense. SHAWNA THOMAS: Sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. Ed, I wanted to ask you, one of the things that is different is this overlay of racial politics as well, the fact that the killer in El Paso said he, specifically, went to target Mexicans and that this was the largest attack on the Latino community this country has ever seen. Does that overlay the hate crime change things? ED O'KEEFE: I think it does to some extent, especially because it happened in such a border community that's defined by its Latino heritage. You know, and-- and the fact, frankly, that one of the presidential candidates is from there. Beto O'Rourke. He was able to help draw even more attention to this perhaps than it would have gotten otherwise. There has been a lot of debate in the past week about, you know, is this just a gun debate or is this-- does this also have to be a conversation about the fact that this was the largest anti-Latino attack, essentially, in modern history. And I have talked to some colleagues, and I asked Julian Castro the other day when he was here whether or not he thought the nation's response have been proper. He thought to some extent it had. But I got a sense from him that, perhaps, it could have been a little stronger or there could have been more conversation about that. But I think it-- it absolutely helps fuel the conversation, because race is, will be, and-- and-- and probably should continue to be part of the conversation in this campaign-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ED O'KEEFE: --given the fact that you have so many historic candidates running, given that the Democratic Party continues to have this debate over where exactly it should be campaigning for votes in order to win back the White House. Do you focus on southern states with younger and more minority populations? Do you come back to here in the Midwest and-- and try to drive up the numbers among-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ED O'KEEFE: --white working-class voters. Although if you were to come to Iowa, you would find a growing percentage of Latino people here. So it's an argument that has a double relevance certainly over the past week and candidates knew that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Shawna, Joe Biden had a few missteps this week. Steve Scalise in this interview on our show hit him on a few of those things. But one of them was also he-- he seemed to say something to the effect of poor kids are just as good as white kids. The-- the right jumped on him for that. SHAWNA THOMAS: Yeah. And, you know, here's the deal, Joe Biden is an older person, and sometimes he is going to-- he is going to say things that sound like mistakes. That is something that he and his campaign are going to have to deal with, because in the world we currently live in with, you know, social media, twenty-four-hour cable news, everything else, every little thing you do is going to be under a microscope. And Republicans are going to jump on him for that. I think it is clear what he was trying to say. I don't think he was trying to in any way in this type of commentary be racist or-- or anything like that. But this is a problem they are going to have to continue to deal with. And it's going to happen in debates. He-- this-- he's just going to have to figure out how to speak a little bit more carefully. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jerry, when you look at what happened this week-- GERALD SEIB: Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and the escalation of the trade war, there are some Republicans who are nervous that the President is hurting his chances at reelection if his bet does not pay off. GERALD SEIB: Well, it's an interesting situation, because this is actually an issue the trade fight with China in particular where the President has some bipartisan support. You know, Chuck Schumer's warning to the President a few months ago was, don't go soft on China. So up to this point, he's got a lot of Republican support, a fair amount of business community support, and some Democratic support. But a lot of that support is basically premised on the idea that the trade wars will be temporary and that they'll be contained. And this is the week where I think it started to look as if, wait, this might get out of control and it might go on for a long time. And I think some people who are with the President now on trade didn't sign up for a long trade war. They signed up for a short tariff fight. And if that's not what it is I think it becomes very problematic for the President or at least potentially so. SHAWNA THOMAS: And those farmers in Iowa want to know-- GERALD SEIB: Yeah. SHAWNA THOMAS: --what the future holds for them. I mean we've talked to a lot of farmers in Iowa in Vice News, who are basically saying, okay, I-- I am willing to go with the President because I do think we need to stand up to China, but if I don't have some consistency soon, I don't know how to make decisions about my business and I'm going to lose money. And that's scary. GERALD SEIB: And it's interesting that if you look at the numbers, the trade deficit actually went up in the first six months of this year. It's bigger now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GERALD SEIB: It's eight percent bigger than it was a year ago. So you have to ask the question, is this working? Is this trade war working? It was supposed to bring the trade deficit down. So I think it's a very tricky time. We-- we may be at a bit of an inflection point for President Trump on the trade issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's something we'll watch. Thanks to all of you, and that-- thanks to Ed out in Iowa. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that aired Sunday, May 5, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It's quiet here in Washington, but that is not the case in other parts of the world.\u00a0 Overnight, we've seen the worst flare up in violence between Israel and Hamas in months. Hamas fired hundreds of rockets into Israel which responded with what Prime Minister Netanyahu called \"massive airstrikes in Gaza.\" Meanwhile, North Korea tested what appear to be short range missiles as President Trump's diplomatic outreach stalls. Kim Jong Un personally oversaw that launch. \u00a0And in Venezuela, a U.S. backed uprising against Nicolas Maduro fizzled as opposition leader Juan Guido was unable to peel away his key military support.\u00a0 We begin this morning with America's top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Welcome to \"Face the Nation\" on a very busy morning for you. On this latest North Korea test, it appears to be short range missiles. Does Kim Jong Un get a pass on this or are we looking at a situation where more sanctions are necessary? SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO: So the sanctions haven't changed. The toughest sanctions in the history of North Korea remain in place. That's probably what's putting some of the pressure on Chairman Kim today. You saw this happen too right after his visit to Russia. Right- right after he spoke with Vladimir Putin, he made the decision to take these actions. We're still evaluating the appropriate response. But I want everyone in your audience to know we're going to exhaust every diplomatic opportunity there is. I continue to invite our counterparts for negotiations. We still believe there is a path forward where Chairman Kim can denuclearize without resort to anything beyond diplomacy. We're hopeful that we can achieve that. We've made real progress between Singapore and Hanoi and we hope that progress can continue. It would be the best outcome for the world and Chairman Kim's commitment that he made to President Trump back in Singapore remains in effect. He has said he's prepared to denuclearize. My task as America's most senior diplomat is to achieve that. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when President Trump tweeted \"I'm with him,\" he wasn't saying that this test will go without consequence. SEC. POMPEO: I think President Trump understands that the path forward that is the most optimal for the entire world is a negotiated solution to this. So we're- he- I talked to him last night. We are full speed ahead and trying to work with the North Koreans to diplomatically achieve the verified denuclearization on the peninsula. MARGARET BRENNAN: Cynthia Warmbier, the mother of Otto Warmbier, the college student from the University of Virginia who died in North- after being released from North Korean custody, spoke out forcefully about Kim Jong Un and the diplomacy under way. Take a listen. *Take SOT* MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to her? SEC. POMPEO: Well, I've gotten to know the Warmbier family, especially Cindy. She's an amazing patriot and a remarkable woman and I have enormous sympathy for her and admiration for her as well, and I completely understand her remarks. We're hopeful. We don't expect Chairman Kim to tell us the truth. That's why we're going to verify any denuclearization that takes place. That's why we will ensure that we see actual on-the-ground- on-the-ground outcomes. We're not going to take anyone's word for it but we want to work to try and do that in a way that is a negotiated solution and that's our mission set. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you still President Trump's lead negotiator on North Korea? SEC. POMPEO: So far as I know. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the North Koreans have said they objected to negotiating with you personally. SEC. POMPEO: The North Koreans don't get to choose our negotiator and we don't get to choose theirs. Each of these two leaders is also very personally committed to this effort. They've both shown great effort to try and achieve this outcome. I'm working to support those two leaders so that we can get the outcome that the world deserves. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about China. Chinese officials are headed here to Washington for trade talks. We heard from a Pentagon official on Friday, a pretty stark description of what is underway right now in China. He- he said that there are 3 million Muslims being rounded up into concentration camps in China. Why hasn't the administration taken any kind of action or sanction against Beijing for this? SEC. POMPEO: Oh goodness. The- President Trump has pushed back against China in a way that no previous president had-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Concentration camps-- SEC. POMPEO: --they'd- they'd given- they- they had given the Chinese a free pass in every dimension. President Trump is now pushing back on the enormous trade abuses. You've seen me personally speak out about the same situation that you're describing, this- this number certainly up to a million people held in reeducation camps. The Trump administration is going to hold every nation accountable-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You're okay with that term, reeducation camps, not concentration camps, which the Pentagon used? SEC. POMPEO: We can- we can use lots of different terms to describe what's taking place. This is an enormous human rights violations. I've spoken about it repeatedly-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why the difference between-- SEC. POMPEO: --the entire administration has spoken on it repeatedly. MARGARET BRENNAN: You just said a million minorities. SEC. POMPEO: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Pentagon says 3 million. SEC. POMPEO: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a discrepancy within the administration-- SEC. POMPEO: No-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --on what to do about this and what's actually happening? SEC. POMPEO: There- there- there- there's not. Don't- don't don't play ticky tac. There's no discrepancy. This administration this- this-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Concentration camps is a loaded term, sir. SEC. POMPEO: Ma'am-- MARGARET \u00a0BRENNAN: And three million Muslims being rounded up is something that many would expect the United States to raise-- SEC. POMPEO: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --at the highest levels. SEC. POMPEO: And- and we've done so. MARGARET BRENNAN: So- sanctions-- SEC. POMPEO: So it sounds like you're satisfied with that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- SEC. POMPEO: Right, we- we've done so, right? And so- don't- don't- don't- don't- don't make-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But why use sanctions? Should we expect that? Be- because the accusation as you know, sir, is that the trade talks are causing the US to choose its own financial interests over its values. Are you saying that's not the case and there will be actions taken? SEC. POMPEO: Thanks for the clarification of your question, I- I appreciate that. This administration can do more than one thing at a time. We're working to stop the intellectual property theft that has destroyed millions of jobs in the United States. We're working to stop the foreign technology transfer- foreign technology transfers that have taken place. We've got the largest defense budget in history in place, part of which will go to ensuring we counter Chinese military power. We're working on these human rights violations as well. This administration takes a backseat to no one in our efforts and our outcomes in achieving a more rational relationship with China. The previous administration put us in a bad place and we're working to fix it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Were you just saying human rights are going to be included in the trade deal? SEC. POMPEO: No human- human rights are- are going to be addressed. MARGARET BRENNAN: On-- SEC. POMPEO: And we've done so. I've raised it in multiple conversations with my counterpart their foreign minister and with others. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got the whole world as your portfolio so let's move on to Venezuela and Russia. There was this phone call between Vladimir Putin and President Trump that just happened. The president described it to us in an Oval Office spray. Why didn't he bring up election interference on this phone call when he said he did discuss the findings of the Mueller Report which found sweeping and systematic Russian interference in 2016? SEC. POMPEO: Well you'll have to ask the White House that question. The president's been very clear. The administration has taken great action. I wish the previous one had stopped the election interference that took place in 2016. They failed to do so. Between 2017 when President Trump came into office and 2018, we had a successful election year, a set of midterm elections. We're working diligently to ensure that the elections in 2020 aren't interfered with by Russia, by Iran, by North Korea or anyone else. We have enormous resource deployed against that challenge. And the American people should be sure that their government is working hard to keep our election safe and secure. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said, this week, that Moscow has hundreds of people in Venezuela and you were very clear that you think it was Russia that convinced Nicolas Maduro not to get on a plane and to flee the country. Here's what the president said during his- after his phone call with Vladimir Putin. *Take SOT* MARGARET BRENNAN: There seems to be a difference in how the president described the situation and how you and Ambassador Bolton have described it. SEC. POMPEO: No, no difference, no difference. The- the president has said, I think he in fact tweeted, that the Russians must leave Venezuela. We've asked every nation that is in- interfering with Venezuelan democracy- you've seen this. I- I was down on the border. We saw mothers who couldn't feed their children, fleeing the country. We saw families that had sick kids but couldn't get medicines, all sitting, was sitting within 50 miles of where we were located. And Maduro won't allow it to come in. The president's been very clear, we want the Cubans out. There are Iranians on the ground there. We want the Russians- we want everyone out so that the Venezuelan people can get the democracy they deserve. That includes Mr. Maduro leaving. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when he says, the president says, \"Putin is not looking to get involved at all in Venezuela,\" that is not the president accepting him at face value? SEC. POMPEO: You'll- you'll have to leave- you'll have to look at-- MARGARET BRENNAN: He knows that that's not the case? SEC. POMPEO: The- the president has tweeted that he wants the Russians out of Venezuela. MARGARET BRENNAN: So he was just putting a positive spin on things in that moment? SEC. POMPEO: We- we are working very diligently to ensure that Maduro leaves and we get free and fair elections in Venezuela. That will require the 2,300 Cuban security personnel, the- frankly, the people closest to Maduro who are protecting the in- tight security for Maduro, they've got to leave. We're working on that as well. We're working with the Cubans to try and get an outcome that will let the Venezuelans have this opportunity. MARGARET BRENNAN: On this, I know you'll be meeting with the Russian foreign minister in the coming days. Is there a deal to be struck with Russia on this front? I mean, Russia benefits, right, by having Venezuelan oil off the market, by having a level of influence in America's backyard. Is the U.S. going to negotiate a deal with Russia on Venezuela? SEC. POMPEO: I'll certainly bring up Venezuela, be one of many topics that Foreign Minister Lav- Lavrov and I speak about- speak about. Whether there's a particular deal that can be reached? Only time will tell. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina who I know you know well tweeted this week, \"Cuba, Russia sent troops to prop up Maduro in Venezuela while we talk and have sanctions. Where's our aircraft carrier?\" He seems to be calling a bluff here on your mention and mention from others that military options aren't off the table. What is actually being considered here because you can't refer to the use of military force lightly. Is there an actual option that you are considering deploying in the coming days? SEC. POMPEO: Oh goodness. The president's made clear that no option is off the table. We worked this week to further the planning so that we'd have a wide range of options. Diplomatic options, political options, options that would involve the Department of Defense. We- we've made clear the president- the- the president-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's hospital ships that or that's actual offensive action? SEC. POMPEO: There are- there'll be many options that we will fully bake, make sure they're ready, get laid out in exquisite detail that are executable so that when the situation changes on the ground or the president makes a conclusion that it's a path he wants to go down that these options are prepared for him. We wouldn't want to be flat footed and we've worked diligent to make sure that that capability, a wide range of capabilities, are prepared to be executed. MARGARET BRENNAN: And just final point on this. Juan Guaido, the opposition leader that the US backs and many other countries recognize as a legitimate leader, has said that he essentially miscalculated the level of support in assuming the military would back him or break away from Maduro. Are you still saying a military option is on the table when the opposition leader we are backing can't get the support of his country's military? SEC. POMPEO: Well he didn't get it that day. Although the senior intelligence official left, that's not the case that military haven't left. There have been a- lots of Venezuelan military that have departed-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Not enough-- SEC. POMPEO: --but- but let's make that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --to make that successful? SEC. POMPEO: Not yet. We're not there yet. We're- we won't be successful till the day that we are. And we're determined to see that the Venezuelan people have their democracy restored as are 54 other nations including most every nation in the region. They understand that the three million refugees, three million migrants that have departed Venezuela, another two million this year, is unacceptable for their region and they are working to build out a coalition to support the Venezuelan people and their democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright, Mr. Secretary. I'm told we have to leave it there. Thank you for coming in. SEC. POMPEO: Thank you, ma'am.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia that aired Sunday, March 17, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Late last night we spoke with Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, he had just returned from a visit to the Venezuelan border and spoke to us from Bogota, Colombia.\u00a0 We asked Senator Kaine about President Trump saying that he did not think white nationalism was a rising threat around the world. SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, it is on the rise and the president should call it out but sadly he's not doing that. We saw in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Charlottesville that he tried to say that the white supremacists, neo-Nazis, neo confederates there were just, you know, good people. But when you see church shootings in Charleston, a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, you see this hate filled manifesto of the shooter in New Zealand who is murdering Muslims, we have to confront the fact that there is a rise in white supremacy, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim attitudes. The president uses language often that's very similar to the language used by these bigots and racists. And if he's not going to call it out then other leaders have to do more to call it out and I certainly will. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the president did say it was a horrible thing that happened but he said that the White Nationalism issue is just a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. What do you attribute the rise to? SEN. KAINE: Well they have problems but- I think the president is using language that emboldens them. He's not creating them. They're out there. But you know at the same time as he was tweeting out yesterday his support for the family members in New Zealand, and that was appropriate, he was vetoing the Senate's rejection of his emergency declaration from Thursday. And he used the word invaders to characterize people coming to the nation's southern borders which was exactly the same phrase that the shooter in New Zealand used to characterize the Muslims that he was attacking. That kind of language from the person who probably has the loudest microphone on the planet Earth is hurtful and dangerous and it tends to incite violence. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about an exchange you had this week that seemed quite tense. You were very clearly frustrated with the acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan because you were asking why a list of military projects had not been provided to Congress that would be directly impacted by funding cuts due to re-allocation for the president's border wall.\u00a0 SEN. KAINE: I'm on the Armed Services Committee. I represent Virginia. I have a child in the military so I sent a letter on February 15th to the secretary of defense and said if you're going to ransack the Pentagon's budget, tell me what projects you're going to cut or delay or eliminate. They wouldn't provide an answer. At the hearing on Thursday we-we're now going to vote that day on whether we support or reject the emergency declaration and they still hadn't answered our question, \"What projects are at stake?\" At the hearing he said \"Oh I'll send you the list later this afternoon.\"\u00a0 And you're right I kind of blew up at him. You're gonna give us the list after we vote? This is highly relevant to the vote about the president's emergency declaration. What projects are you going to ransack out of the Pentagon budget? Is it going to be military housing? Is it going to be trying to make our bases safer from terrorism with construction projects? Is it going to be rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base that got blitzed in the hurricanes last fall? And they said they would give us the list after. But Margaret, to add insult to injury they had to walk that back. They don't even want to give us the list now at all we're going to have to have an override vote. I don't think the White House wants us to see the list before the override vote. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think the White House is withholding this information you say is so relevant because of an upcoming vote? SEN. KAINE: I think there's one reason. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're- you're connecting. You think they're trying to influence the outcome of it. SEN. KAINE: Absolutely. This is not the Secretary of Defense in my view, this is the White House wanting to hold the list back because they worry that if senators and House members saw the potential projects that were going to be ransacked to pay for the president's wall, they would lose votes. And I think they're going to try to hide the list until that veto override vote occurs in the House and then in the Senate.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You are of course in Colombia nearby. What is a country that is really crippled in many ways economically right now, Venezuela. There are about 3 million refugees who have fled, the energy and oil industry is collapsing as is the economy there. What is it that you were going to the border to see? What did you learn? SEN. KAINE: Well Margaret I wanted to see a couple of things. One, to support the Colombian government because their effort to provide assistance to these millions of Venezuelanos has been really momentous. But secondly, learn what more the United States can do. We have worked together actually in an accord between the administration and Congress to provide significant amounts of humanitarian aid, to- to work together, to pull together a coalition of nations. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But as you know, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro still is in charge of that country whether we like it or not. And these sanctions have not seemingly changed his calculus. The visas, the diplomatic isolation, what is this actually accomplishing at this point? SEN. KAINE: Well it's- it's giving hope to Venezuelans that their fina- there may finally be some change. The question isn't whether Maduro likes it or not, the question is what the Venezuelan people want. And the National Assembly has determined that the election of President Mazur- Maduro was illegitimate. There needs to be a new- new government. So what more can we do more? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 SEN. KAINE: More humanitarian aid, more work together to pull more nations into our coalition. The sanctions are important. They're having an effect. Sanctions are economic but they're also visa restrictions on Maduro and his cronies as they try to travel abroad. We need to give hope to the Venezuelan people that we stand with them and support them. It's a massive humanitarian crisis driven by one person, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and the Venezuelan people are speaking out and they want something better. MARGARET BRENNAN: Has the Trump administration whose policy you seem to support right now, have they underestimated how strong he is? SEN. KAINE: I don't know that they've underestimated it. Look, this is- this is not easy. It's a difficult situation. And I do generally support what the Trump administration has done with one exception, I think loose talk about U.S. military action is a big mistake. One, because that's not for the president, it's for Congress. But second, the right strategy here-- there's only one person using the military against Venezuelans and it's Maduro.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine thank you for joining us, safe travels. KAINE: Thanks Margaret. Absolutely.",

I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION.  Unfazed by one of the worst weeks of his administration, the President slammed his critics in the longest speech of his presidency before a group of conservative activists.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with (EXPLETIVE DELETED), okay? With (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  MARGARET BRENNAN: The President is struggling to contain fallout from devastating testimony from former personal attorney Michael Cohen.  MICHAEL COHEN (Wednesday): He is a racist. He is a conman. And he is a cheat.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And blasted Democrats for expanding their investigations.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I saw a little shifty shift and he said we're going to look into his finances. I said where did that come from? He always talked about Russia.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll ask the man in the President's crosshairs, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff about this week's bombshell revelations. And we'll ask the President's national security adviser, John Bolton, what went wrong with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata sat down with Hoda Muthana in Syria. She's the American who joined ISIS and is now barred from returning back home. And Senator Doug Jones talks about what it's like to be a Democrat in the very red state of Alabama.  That, plus analysis on all the news of the week is just ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin today with President Trump's national security adviser Ambassador John Bolton. Good to have you here.  JOHN BOLTON (White House National Security Adviser/@AmbJohnBolton): Glad to be with you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We had different versions of the story as to why this summit failed to produce any results. Why was the President unable to negotiate a breakthrough?  JOHN BOLTON: Well, I don't consider the summit a failure. I consider it a success defined as the President protecting and advancing American national interest. There was extensive preparation for this meeting. Extensive discussions between the President and Kim Jong-un and-- and the issue really was whether North Korea was prepared to accept what the President called the big deal, which is denuclearize entirely under a definition the President handed to Kim Jong-un and have the potential for an enormous economic future or try and do something less than that which was unacceptable to us. So the President held firm to his view. He deepened his relationship with Kim Jong-un. I don't view it as a failure at all when American national interests are protected.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, North Korea still has not agreed to denuclearize as the U.S. defines it.  JOHN BOLTON: Not as we have defined it although they have committed in public in prior regimes in North Korea, four or five times in writing to denuclearize and that's something--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So it doesn't mean much to you.  JOHN BOLTON: --we expect them to do if they reach an agreement with us.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the specifics, a senior State Department official spoke to reporters and said that what the North Koreans proposed, specifically, was about dismantling the three-mile Yongbyon complex which he defined as, quote, \"...the totality of North Korea's plutonium reprocessing and uranium enrichment programs,\" in exchange for lifting all sanctions except those on the weapons programs.\" Did the U.S. make a counter offer?  JOHN BOLTON: Well, the counter offer has been there from the beginning, from-- from the very first summit back in Singapore, which is if North Korea commits to complete denuclearization, including its ballistic missile program and its chemical and biological weapons programs, the prospect of economic progress is there. The President--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not what North Korea put on the table.  JOHN BOLTON: That's not what they-- that's not--  MARGARET BRENNAN: They put on this narrow definition.  JOHN BOLTON: A very limited concession by the North Koreans involving the Yongbyon complex which includes an aging nuclear reactor and some percentage of their uranium enrichment plutonium reprocessing capabilities. In exchange they wanted substantial relief from the sanctions. Now, one thing President Trump has said beginning in the 2016 campaign is that he's not going to make the mistakes of prior administrations and get into this action for action kind of arrangement which benefits--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So there was no counter offer.  JOHN BOLTON: --the North Koreans. Our counter offer was where we have been where the President's has exercised his persuasive abilities on Kim Jong-un to take the big deal and they weren't willing to do it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But what made the President stake out this maximalist position?  JOHN BOLTON: It's not--  MARGARET BRENNAN: You've negotiated with the North Koreans before, going back to 2002. Did you see the same pattern playing out now?  JOHN BOLTON: I think the difference that President Trump has articulated to the North Koreans is the future for them once they make the strategic decision to denuclearize. What they've done before is promise to denuclearize, get economic benefits in return and then renege on the deal. What the President was trying to get them to do is look at what was possible for them overall. And I think he remains optimistic that this is possible. Kim Jong-un himself said in our last meeting, you know, we're going to go through many stations on-- before we achieve this deal. The meeting in Hanoi was one such station. So the President is ready to keep talking.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you expecting North Korea to come back with an offer?  JOHN BOLTON: I don't know what they're going to do. I think the President himself said that he expects they'll want to go back and re-evaluate what happened. Certainly, we will-- we'll look at continuing the economic sanctions against North Korea which brought them to the table in the first place. We'll see what happens next.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But, in the meantime, North Korea can still produce nuclear fuel.  JOHN BOLTON: And they have been doing it. Yes, they have. That's exactly correct.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're a growing threat.  JOHN BOLTON: Well, I think our objective remains to find a way to get them to denuclearize. The President's trying this negotiation but his objective has always been denuclearization.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the window for diplomacy about to close here? I mean this is-- this seems like an open-ended timeline.  JOHN BOLTON: I wouldn't-- I wouldn't say it that way. Look, the President opened the door for North Korea in Singapore and they didn't walk through. He kept the door open--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Eight months ago.  JOHN BOLTON: He kept the door open during that eight-month period. He kept it open in Hanoi. The North Koreans can walk through it. It's really up to them. That's the diplomatic window.  MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were on this program last July, though, you said the plan was to dismantle North Korea's nuclear facilities and have it turn over its weapons of mass destruction within a year.  JOHN BOLTON: What--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that still a realistic timeline?  JOHN BOLTON: No, the question you asked then was operationally, how long would it take? There was some dispute within the U.S. government over a period of time. Once North Korea made the strategic decision to give up its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, how long would it take to conduct that dismantlement? And with a few exceptions, our judgment was we could finish it within a year. Once the process started.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So you still think it will take a year to dismantle it?  JOHN BOLTON: This is--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you acknowledged they haven't even agreed to denuclearize--  JOHN BOLTON: No, no they have not agreed. Exactly.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --and there's no expiration date on this offer to continue to negotiate?  JOHN BOLTON: There-- there is no expiration date. As I say, the President is fully prepared to keep negotiating at lower levels or to speak to Kim Jong-un again when it's appropriate.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But aren't they a growing threat if they can continue to develop nuclear fuel? Doesn't the leverage get reduced on our end?  JOHN BOLTON: I don't think the leverage gets reduced because I think we will keep the maximum pressure campaign in place even before the summit. We were looking at ways to tighten it up to-- to stop, for example, the ship-to-ship transfers that the North Koreans are using to evade the sanctions, to talk to other countries to make sure they tighten up on North Korea. It was the sanctions that brought the North Koreans to the table. It's the sanctions they want relief from and relief they can get if they denuclearize.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Before the President went to Hanoi, was the U.S. aware that North Korea would not allow anything beyond the Yongbyon complex? I mean the second uranium enrichment site that the President nodded to in his press conference. Did you know that was not on the table?  JOHN BOLTON: Well, we don't know what's on the table from-- from North Korea until it comes out of the-- the mouth of Kim Jong-un, the chairman. He's calling--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's the diplomats are supposed to be laying the groundwork for.  JOHN BOLTON: He's--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President doesn't walk away with a failure.  JOHN BOLTON: He-- he didn't walk away with a failure. Unless you're prepared to say that it would be better to accept a bad deal than to walk away from no deal, to me that's a success.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So you thought that nothing else was on the table. You were just testing the prospects by sending the President to Hanoi?  JOHN BOLTON: No, no, no. We-- we, honestly, didn't know. I mean it's-- it's not unusual in these circumstances to find that there are additional concessions that the other side might make. But we've tried to make it clear to them-- as again the President has said this repeatedly we're not going to make the mistakes of past administrations. We're not going to make the mistake that Obama made in the Iran nuclear deal. What we want is denuclearization broadly defined as the President himself laid out for Kim Jong-un in the paper that he gave him.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- but you've tested this proposition now of what it's like to negotiate top down?  JOHN BOLTON: Well, we've had two-- we've had two meetings.  MARGARET BRENNAN: This is now the, what, fourth Commander-in-Chief to try to do this? There's a very different approach, but the success rate hasn't been anything more than in the past.  JOHN BOLTON: Well, the success rate in the past was zero. So that's not a hard bar to overcome. There's a-- there's an argument that proceeding deductively rather than inductively makes a lot of sense. We've had two meetings. We-- we'll see what happens next.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But, in the meantime, as we say, they can still produce nuclear fuel. And as you saw after the President left Hanoi, Kim Jong-un stayed there. I mean he was walking around touring hot spots in Vietnam. He no longer looks like a pariah. Didn't he gain from this?  JOHN BOLTON: I don't think that's the President's view at all. It-- it's--  MARGARET BRENNAN: He sat across from the President almost as if an equal.  JOHN BOLTON: He-- he did that in Singapore. The President's view is he gave nothing away.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you actually believe that?  JOHN BOLTON: The President's view is he gave nothing away. That's-- that's what matters, not my view. As I've said before, I guess I can't get people to listen so I'll try it one more time. I'm the national security advisor. I'm not the national security decision maker.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your-- your views have been well documented in the past.  JOHN BOLTON: Usually, by me. I mean I've written a lot-- I've written a lot in the past.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You've-- you've been skeptical for-- for--  JOHN BOLTON: And-- and--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --many, many years.  JOHN BOLTON: --and, as I've said, those-- those views are out there. Anybody can read them.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  JOHN BOLTON: My job now is to help the President, give him his advice, give him my advice. He'll make the decisions.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And to be clear the administration still is no longer advocating regime change?  JOHN BOLTON: The-- the position of the administration is we want denuclearization of North Korea and that's the objective we're pursuing.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you still believe that Kim Jong-un can deliver on that?  JOHN BOLTON: I think he is the authoritative ruler of that country and if he were to make the strategic decision to denuclearize, we think it would happen.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The President was asked about this American student Otto Warmbier who died tragically after being released after some brutal treatment in North Korean captivity. When was it that the President actually brought up his case to Kim Jong-un?  JOHN BOLTON: Well, that was in one of the meetings in-- on-- on the second day, I think, and look--  MARGARET BRENNAN: In Hanoi?  JOHN BOLTON: In Hanoi. The President's been--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that the first time he brought it up?  JOHN BOLTON: No I think it's been brought up before. I think it was brought up in Singapore. But the President's been very clear he-- he viewed what happened to Otto Warmbier as barbaric and unacceptable and I think the best thing North Korea could do right now would be to come up with a full explanation of exactly what happened to him.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But it seemed to suggest that the President, since he said he took Kim Jong-un and his word, was willing to put aside these egregious human rights abuses and, basically, the killing of an American while in captivity.  JOHN BOLTON: Listen, I've heard the President talk about Otto Warmbier on any number of occasions in the Oval Office. And I know how strongly he feels about it. I have no doubt of that whatever.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go I want to ask you the House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings has requested information about your personal security clearance. Is there anything you know of that would have raised a red flag what he's looking for here?  JOHN BOLTON: Not-- not at all. You know someday I'll be a private citizen again and I'd be delighted to take this nonsense on in detail. But as a White House official right now threatened with subpoenas, with a lot of other things that's going on in Congress, I'll take guidance from the White House Counsel's Office and the Justice Department and just wait for the day when I am a private citizen.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But counsel, the White House, will respond to this?  JOHN BOLTON: They will respond to it, that's correct.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Bolton, thank you for joining us.  JOHN BOLTON: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. He joins us from Boynton Beach, Florida, this morning. Good morning to you, Congressman. The President personally--  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D-California/@RepAdamSchiff/Intelligence Committee Chairman): Good morning.  MARGARET BRENNAN: -- attacked you yesterday at a conservative political action summit and he balked at, specifically, the broadening of the investigation into his finances. Can you clarify exactly what Democrats are looking for here? Is it his tax returns?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I'm not surprised the President has balked at the Congress looking into his personal business, something he's tried to draw a red line around. But we have seen from our own investigation, as well as the special counsel's, just how perilous it would be for the country if we ignored or allowed him to draw red lines. The Moscow Trump Tower deal, for example, is among the most disturbing because that's something the President was pursuing throughout the midst of the presidential campaign, while saying he was having no business dealings with the Russians. That was a deal that stood to make him more money than any other deal in his life. And it was a deal where he was pursuing help from the Kremlin-- from Putin himself-- at a time when Putin was seeking relief from sanctions and that is the most compromising circumstance that I can imagine. So we are certainly looking deep into the set of issues around Moscow Trump Tower. We're also looking at persistent allegations that the Russians have been laundering money through the Trump Organization. I don't know that that's true. But if it is, again, it's a profound compromise of this President.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you don't know that that's true. Who can answer that question for you? Who do you need to talk to?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we'll need to talk to some of the banks that have been doing business with Mister Trump. But like Deutsche Bank which has had a history of laundering Russian money, it was a-- a bank, one of the very few if only that would do business with Mister Trump after American banks refused. But we also will want to speak with the-- the accountants, the chief financial officers for the Trump Organization and others who would have information about the Moscow Trump Tower deal, about the issue of money laundering. In fact, we're bringing Felix Sater in to talk about--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --Moscow Trump Tower in a couple of weeks. So there are any number of witnesses that can shed light on whether America's national security is compromised because the President has been pursuing financial interests with the Russians.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Michael Cohen I know will be testifying again for your committee this week. What kind of corroborating materials do you expect him to bring to that meeting?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, Mister Cohen testified in open session, and I can't go into our closed session interview, but about his false testimony before our committee previously and how that written statement had gone through different drafts or iterations. He testified in open session that others have reviewed that testimony and we have, obviously, a deep and compelling interest in whether others were knowing of those false statements that he would make to Congress, whether there are any other acts or evidence of obstruction of justice which is also a core part of our investigation.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Cohen said though in that open testimony, he had no direct evidence of collusion with Russia. The Senate Intel chairman also said at this point no evidence of collusion at this point. Have you seen-- do you have direct evidence of collusion with Russia?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think there is direct evidence in the e-mails from the Russians through their intermediary offering dirt on Hillary Clinton as part of what is described in writing as the Russian government effort to help elect Donald Trump. They offer that dirt. There is an acceptance of that offer in writing from the President's son Don Junior and there is overt acts in furtherance of that. That is the meeting at Trump Tower and all the lies to cover up that meeting at the Trump Tower and, apparently, lies that the President participated in. That to me is direct evidence but there's also abundant circumstantial evidence. There is, for example, evidence of Manafort sharing internal polling data with someone linked to the Russian intelligence services.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But--  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Why do that? What legitimate purpose is there for things like that? Michael Cohen's own testimony was circumstantial evidence that the President was dealing with Roger Stone who is dealing with WikiLeaks in an effort to--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But none of this--  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --find out about--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --amounts to--  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --releases of information.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --impeachment grounds for you still. I mean these are serious allegations.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I mean here's the thing and I've made this-- I made this distinction all along and that is while there is abundant evidence of collusion, the issue from a criminal point of view is whether there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a criminal conspiracy. And that is something that we will have to await Bob Mueller's report and the underlying evidence to determine. We will also have to look at the whole body of improper and criminal actions by the President, including those campaign finance crimes to determine whether they rise to the level of removal from office. I have said that I think we should await the evidence from Bob Mueller as well as our own work. And I am pleased to see that Mister Nunez who and I-- he and I have profound disagreements about many things are in agreement on one thing the report and the evidence needs to be provided to Congress. I think that also needs to be made public.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader has called for your recusal saying that because you had contact with Michael Cohen that that you should not be directly involved in these investigations any longer and that you set that standard. How do you respond to that?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, it-- it's pretty frivolous. What McCarthy is upset about is that I invited Michael Cohen to testify and that he accepted, and our staff sat down and interviewed him before his testimony. That's what you do in any credible investigation. Bob Mueller's team sat down with--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that the extent of your contact?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --Michael Cohen seven times. The extent of my contact was just inviting him to testify and also trying to lay his concerns about the presence of threats against him and his family, but our staff certainly sat down to interview him and that's what you do in any credible investigation. Mister McCarthy, I think, can be forgiven for not knowing how to run a credible investigation. For the last two years they did none. But one thing that I think is really unforgivable and that's the degree to which Mister McCarthy and others have prostrate themselves before this President, and not just in the Russia investigation but even more significantly now with this emergency declaration, which is a--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --an attack on the Congress's power of the purse. And for Kevin McCarthy, as the Republican leader, to go along with that, to so debase himself before this President at the cost of our institution--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --I think, is unforgivable.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Congressman. We'll be back in one minute to take a--  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --look at what did happen at that Hanoi summit. Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: After we finished our interview with Chairman Schiff, he asked to turn the cameras back on to comment on what Ambassador Bolton had said about the North Korea summit.  Congressman, what was your impression of how the national security adviser described what happened in Hanoi?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I was struck by one thing in particular and that is when you asked him whether the President had given up anything by going to this summit and walking away empty handed and his answer was that the President didn't believe so. And you asked him, well, do you believe so and he said well what the President believes is all that matters. He couldn't even agree with his own President but course-- of course, the President did give up a great deal by going to that summit, by enhancing Kim Jong-un's prestige on the world stage, by giving up those military exercises in the last summit and getting nothing for it. And this is, I think, the result of a President who is not prepared for these kind of negotiations, a staff that is not well prepared, and that is, essentially, flying by the seat of its pants and it has real world consequences. Those reactors continue to spin on, as you point out, producing more material that can threaten us and our allies. And I think that this was a spectacular failure but made all-- all the worse by the President's obsequious comments when it came to the murder of an American citizen, Otto Warmbier.  MARGARET BRENNAN: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff weighing in on the North Korean summit. We, obviously, spoke with both gentlemen earlier.  We will be back in a moment with more FACE THE NATION.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: I traveled to Vietnam this past week for CBS News' coverage of the summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. Even though there were no agreements out of Hanoi, there were some remarkable moments.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: The theater of the summit almost overshadowed the seriousness of the issues. On the streets of Hanoi, T-shirts with quirky images of President Trump and Kim Jong-un were sold as souvenirs. A local bar served up a kimchi-flavored beer called Kim Jong ale, but the two unpredictable leaders spent far longer traveling to Vietnam than they did negotiating. Kim took a sixty-plus-hour train ride. President Trump flew seventeen hours plus to go half way around the world.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sometimes you have to walk and this was just one of those times.  MARGARET BRENNAN: They left with a stalemate and a pledge to have diplomats continue talking. But even that may be a winning prospect for Kim, who no longer appears a pariah. He stayed in Vietnam after the summit to tour hotspots, an option not afforded to his people, they are forbidden to travel. Still, the sanctions choking his country's economy remain as do widespread food shortages.  North Korea is strapped for cash due to crippling global sanctions so it relies on illicit trade and even state-owned businesses like this restaurant which sends money back to Pyongyang.  Now it may be even harder to get other countries to shut down these small operations. After Kim earned the right to sit across from the President as almost an equal, since he figured out how to threaten the U.S. with nuclear weapons and then flattered him with letters flirting with the idea of giving that arsenal away. The U.S. did learn a few things, that Kim does not want to be isolated and, most of all, that he wants the financial strain on North Korea lifted.  MAN #1: Chairman Kim, are you confident?  MARGARET BRENNAN: It was extraordinary to see him face questions from the Western press for the very first time.  WOMAN #1: Chairman Kim, are you ready to allow the United States to have an office in Pyongyang?  WOMAN #2 (through translator): Are you ready for that step?  MARGARET BRENNAN: Questions that make aides nervous but even President Trump wanted answered.  MAN #2 (through translator): Is it better to leave? Let the media go?  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. I think we will. I think we will. It's actually an interesting question. I would like to actually hear that answer.  MARGARET BRENNAN: While the brinksmanship of these two unusual personalities failed to forge a breakthrough, at least neither side seemed ready to escalate to war. Instead, leaving the door open to future diplomacy.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but we will be back with Senator Doug Jones. He is here to talk about his new book, Bending Towards Justice: The Birmingham Church Bombing That Changed The Course Of Civil Rights. We'll also talk with him about the case of a young woman from Alabama who joined ISIS and now wants to return home to the U.S. Our Charlie D'Agata spoke with her yesterday.  Plus, our political panel is ahead, so stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We turn now to the case of Hoda Muthana, a twenty-four-year-old woman born in New Jersey and raised in Alabama. In 2014 she joined ISIS and married an ISIS fighter. She now wants to return to the U.S. with her young son but the Trump administration is refusing to grant that request. Her case will be heard tomorrow by a federal judge here in Washington. CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata is in northern Syria and he sat down with Hoda Muthana on Saturday.  CHARLIE D'AGATA (CBS News Foreign Correspondent): Good morning. We met Hoda Muthana and her eighteen-month-old son Adam in a refugee camp that is now home for the foreseeable future. And the first she learned about the U.S. court hearing tomorrow that may decide her fate came from us.  (Begin VT)  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Being so isolated here, do you have any idea the storm of controversy that has been kicked off in the United States over this case?  HODA MUTHANA: People have been telling me they have seen my case on TV and everyone asks me what are you going to do now? Where are you going to go next? I keep-- I keep telling everyone that we are still trying to win the case and, hopefully, we will and I know I am an American citizen and I know I have the right to come back. I have no other citizenship anywhere. Even my own home country I don't. I have never been there. I've never stepped foot out of America. So--  CHARLIE D'AGATA: So there is no talk of like a Yemeni citizenship?  HODA MUTHANA: No.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: You have no Yemeni citizenship?  HODA MUTHANA: No.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: That's not even an option.  HODA MUTHANA: No.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: The President of the United States himself said that you are not welcome back to America, what would you say to him?  HODA MUTHANA: I would tell him to study the legal system because, apparently, I am (INDISTINCT). I have papers, I have citizenship. I have-- my dad, my dad's documents. It's-- it's apparent that he stopped working with the United Nations way before I was born.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Muthana says she handed her passport over to ISIS a month after she crossed into Syria from Turkey in November 2014. She surrendered to U.S.-led coalition forces in January in the dying days of ISIS. She insists she would have left sooner but could never raise enough money to pay smugglers.  Six thousand?  HODA MUTHANA: Six thousand dollars.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Six thousand dollars.  HODA MUTHANA: And there was no way I can get that type of money, so I was held-- we were held hostage there, basically, and the only way to leave was to go through a field of IEDs or snipers from ISIS shooting at you. Or if you do get caught, which I got caught twice and I was very scared, I got caught twice by them. And in one situation I actually broke my phone and ran away.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Yet, for a time she, apparently, embraced the darkest beliefs of ISIS, allegedly, taking to social media to incite attacks on Americans. Her lawyer has advised her not to comment about that.  HODA MUTHANA: I ruined-- I ruined my life. I ruined my life.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: You had, you know--  HODA MUTHANA: I ruined my son's future, but I wouldn't have had a son if I didn't come. That's the only regret I don't have.  (End VT)  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Now, she and other Western ISIS families had to be transferred there from another camp because of death threats from ISIS hard-liners and hers is not an isolated case. She said she knew of maybe a handful of other Americans there, but officials say they will not comment on individual nationalities. Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's our Charlie D'Agata in Syria.  We're now joined by Alabama's Democratic Senator Doug Jones. He's also the author of a new book: Bending Toward Justice: The Birmingham Church Bombing That Changed The Course Of Civil Rights. Senator, I want to ask you about the book, but, first, let's ask-- let's talk about this young woman--  SENATOR DOUG JONES (D-Alabama/Bending Toward Justice/@SenDougJones): Sure.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --because she is from Alabama.  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Yep.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you spoken to the White House about her case?  SENATOR DOUG JONES: No, I have not. You know her citizenship is tied up with the State Department right now. They'll have that hearing on that. You know but no one is going to welcome this person back to the United States. That's just a mischaracterization. I do think we ought to consider bringing her back to face justice. We do it all the time with terrorists, with other people that get-- commit crimes against the United States. I think it sends a kind of a bad message if we give someone a get-out-of-jail-free card just because they go to the Middle East.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Pompeo claims she has no basis to claim U.S. citizenship but she did have a U.S. passport.  SENATOR DOUG JONES: She did. I-- I-- I think that that's going to be decided in the courts and within the State Department. My concern is just the message that we're sending by not bringing someone back to face American justice. I have an abiding faith, you know, I'm an old federal prosecutor myself and I have this faith in our system of justice to do the right thing to make sure that justice is imposed. And I think that that's what we ought to be looking at here.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you talked about your time as a prosecutor. You famously prosecuted KKK members.  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Those involved in that 1963 horrific bombing of a church that killed four little girls. It took decades for the FBI to release any of the evidence they had gathered against the killers.  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: From your experience, do you think digging into history, painful history like this, aggravates tensions or is it necessary?  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Oh, I think it's absolutely necessary. What we saw after-- after those cases it was such a sense of healing. I mean there are still a lot of open wounds for those civil rights cases because people don't know the answers. They don't know why. They don't know the who. And I think, you know, we can look back at ourselves and at a painful time in our history and we can learn from those mistakes so I think it's even more important today. We see hateful rhetoric all over the country these days and it's not just black and white anymore. It's-- it's religion. It's nationality. It's gender. You name it. We see that. And I think to go back and look at that history to make sure we don't miss-- you know, commit the same mistakes that we did the last time. I think it's very important and it's a sense of healing for the community and for those families.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You talk in the book about backsliding. That's a phrase you use.  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Yep.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Particularly, on the voting rights of minorities these days.  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Oh, no question.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Who-- who do you blame for that? What is--  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Well, I-- I think it's a combination of things. I mean I think that-- that we've had some losses in the courts but I also think it's a political power grab right now where people are trying to gerrymander districts, where people are trying to prevent people to-- to the right to vote, give them free access to the vote. We need to be expanding the voter roles and-- and trying to get people to the vote. We need to be pushing the percentage of Americans up who are-- who will to vote on Election Day and, instead, we seem to be working and the powers that be seem to be constricting that. And I think we got to change that. There's a new bill pending right now, introduced last week, on the voter enhancement. Try to put some teeth back in the Voting Rights Act.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Who do you blame for this?  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Well, you know I think if you look at-- carefully, you have to look at the state legislatures, governors, and members of Congress that are Republicans. For whatever reason, they do not want African-Americans and other minorities to vote. I assume rather than-- rather than trying to get those votes, they seem to want to restrict those votes. And I think that that's incredibly unfortunate. We need to have more dialogues in this country rather than monologues and now we can do it about Voting Rights Act. We talk a good game about everybody having the right to vote and a duty to vote. But at the end of the day, we seem to be working to try to restrict that and that's just wrong.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Just yesterday, you saw-- we learned what was going to happen to those two Sacramento police officers involved in the shooting of a-- a man named Stephon Clark. He was about twenty-two years old, shot in his grandmother's backyard. They thought he was armed, turned out it was just a cell phone. It turns out he had faced some accusations--  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --of domestic abuse, other things. But what do you make of this case? Because for many, they see this as an example of a criminal justice system that is unfairly treating and just rigged against African-Americans.  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Well, I-- and to some extent I think that there-- there's some truth to that. I mean, historically, over the last thirty, forty years, especially with the crack cocaine epidemic, we've seen all manner of things where the people of color have been incarcerated on larger scales than-- than those that are-- are not. And I think we took a First Step Act that we passed in Congress this past year, passed Congress, with criminal justice reform, with the President's approval with the support of the administration. I think that is going to go to correct it, but it is very difficult when you have tensions between law enforcement and any minority community. And that's very difficult to do. Law enforcement officers have to make split-second decisions. But, at the same time, there's got to be some way to hold people accountable even if they make the wrong decision at the wrong time.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned the First Step Act which you supported--  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Absolutely.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --that was a Trump administration initiative. I mean you're in this unusual position of being from a very red state, I think you're the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Alabama in--  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Since 1992.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --twenty-five years.  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Yeah, absolutely.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. You're up for re-election in 2020.  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're getting targeted--  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Oh, sure.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --this seat for Republicans to flip it back. How do you convince people in your home state to-- to not make you just, you know, the first in twenty-five years and the last?  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Well, you know, all I do is do my job. I have the people of Alabama's best interests at heart. I am an independent voice for them, I'm not a-- a-- a solid vote-- voice or vote for the President or the Democratic Party. I look at each individual vote separately and I try to do the right thing. I think some of the best compliments I have had in the last year and my one year in the Senate was when I'd go home and people would say, \"Well, Doug, you're doing exactly what you said you would do. And that's looking out for us.\" And we have a lot of issues that we face. But, you know, I think Alabama, the south, we're all changing. There's a lot of things going on. We're putting a-- aside a lot of the issues that have divided us in the past that have caused some of those incredible divisions, political and social divisions. Right now we're talking about jobs, we're talking about health care. That's a driving force in my state. Education, workforce development, those are the things we have in common. And that's what I'm going to keep preaching, then we'll see how it goes. I feel very good about where we are.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for joining us.  SENATOR DOUG JONES: Thank you. It's my pleasure.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back in a moment with our political panel.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our panel for some political analysis. Jeffrey Goldberg is the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Paula Reid covers the Justice Department as well as the White House for CBS, David Sanger is a national security correspondent and senior writer for The New York Times, and David Nakamura covers the White House for The Washington Post. So, I know, you guys aren't over your jet lag because I certainly am not having covered this summit in Hanoi. David, you have a piece, an extensive one, in The New York Times today writing about what went wrong with these talks. You-- you heard the national security advisor give his take. What is the bottom line?  DAVID SANGER (The New York Times/@SangerNYT): Well, I think the bottom line, Margaret, is that they sent the President of the United States halfway around the world into a negotiation that had not been, not only not precooked but, basically, they had nothing when he landed. Usually, the way summits work for all of us who've uncovered these is the President comes in as the closer on the final ten percent. What was clear here was that this was not just the get-to-know-you meeting that happened in Singapore, this was a meeting that was intended to go work out a schedule for the denuclearization. And if you couldn't get that, then at least stop the problem from getting worse.  MARGARET BRENNAN: They couldn't even agree on the definition of denuclearization?  DAVID SANGER: They-- they could not. And Kim came in with a-- with a offer to-- which had been made in various forms over the past three presidencies to go, sort of, have a moratorium on some kind of production at Yongbyon, which is their main nuclear center. There was a-- some remarkable interchanges you heard a little bit of it when you asked Mister Bolton about it, there are sites outside of Yongbyon that are still producing nuclear material. The President, correctly, I think, wanted to get everything shut down. But he left not even getting a suspension of additional production, which means that while this drags on, the North Korean problem is getting worse. They have thirty weapons already. They will probably have more. Also, just the scene of what we were going through--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  DAVID SANGER: --and this was taking place in the Metropole Hotel. It was old French colonial hotel, a century old. Feet from where the President and Kim were meeting is a bomb shelter that was used to herd guests into when the Americans were bombing North Vietnam. So this whole scene of-- of working out one last Cold War problem--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  DAVID SANGER: --on the site where Ho Chi Minh and his-- and others plotted against the Americans and the French was pretty remarkable.  MARGARET BRENNAN: There are so many remarkable moments. We saw one of them in that piece earlier. But, David, we have to point out, you were the reporter--  DAVID NAKAMURA (The Washington Post/@DavidNakamura): Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --who had the guts to--  DAVID NAKAMURA: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --throw out the very first question to Kim Jong-un--  DAVID NAKAMURA: Yep.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --and he answered.  DAVID NAKAMURA: He answered.  MARGARET BRENNAN: That was astounding.  DAVID NAKAMURA: Shout-- shouting a question to the most brutal dictator in the world, what could go wrong, right? Luckily, I'm-- I'm back here to talk about it, luckily, fortunately. No, we didn't know what would happen, I mean, there's a small group of White House reporters that are allowed into these photo-ops. People often shout at President Trump, sometimes the answer is the day before he had gotten irritated by some shouted questions. But we wanted to engage Kim Jong-un. This was a few-- one of the few chances. Even if they had gotten a deal, he would not have appeared at a news conference. So we did ask him-- I asked him whether he was confident he would get a deal. He said it was, at the moment, too early to tell. He was right. And he said he was not pessimistic, he was hopeful. But we saw just hours later I was there in the dining room for lunch, we were-- the press corps was let in and we said the lunch would start around noon, half an hour later they still hadn't happened, and we realized that this thing had gone off the rails and things were not going well and sure enough within about five minutes of that we were told plans had changed, we were led back to the-- to the press hold and then they canceled the lunch and any signing ceremonies, there was no deal.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and we should point out, that's just not your analysis, that was actually on a public schedule--  DAVID NAKAMURA: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --that there was a signing ceremony.  DAVID NAKAMURA: Right. Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So it would be understanding things, Jeff, to say dis-- disappointed, even though, John Bolton said it was not--  JEFFREY GOLDBERG (The Atlantic/@JeffreyGoldberg): Yeah. John Bolton did an admirable job of masking his own obvious feelings regarding this summit. Yeah. I mean, I would just issue one corrective to David's excellent summary, David Sanger's excellent summary, he talked about they brought the President halfway around the world, the President brought himself halfway around the world. Nobody really thought this was going to work. This was not precooked, that would be a vernacular way of describing how summits are-- are made. But you're exactly right. You're supposed to bring the President in to-- to-- to sign the document and maybe argue a little bit. But this was-- this was another thing entirely and this is-- this is the downside of an entirely spontaneous presidency and a President who doesn't actually listen and acknowledges that he doesn't listen to his own intelligence chiefs when they tell him, this is not going to work, this is not going to work, and-- and so on. And so the outcome, it was bizarre scene. But this was predictable, utterly predictable.  DAVID NAKAMURA: It shows the limits of the President's strategy here was, he said, look, with thirty years of negotiation at the lower level--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  DAVID NAKAMURA: --we never got to a presidential summit, let's flip it around--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  DAVID NAKAMURA:--take more risk, start top-down. But, you know, this is something where the President felt his personal relationship with Kim Jong-un, whatever that is, no one's really sure what that is, but he thinks it's good and that-- that would be the closuring, that wouldn't make the deal happen. It's not going to work--  DAVID SANGER: And he may have over-personalized it in that regard.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  DAVID SANGER: He's showing people these letters from Kim Jong-un as if, I have a rapport with him, I'll be able to make this deal.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Paula, the other personal relationship the President had that we heard a lot about this week was with his former attorney Michael Cohen who was testifying while these negotiations are happening. And the President actually acknowledged despite the twelve-hour time difference that he watched the testimony.  PAULA REID (CBS News Correspondent/@PaulaReidCBS): Absolutely. And the timing was deliberate. This is an effort to undermine the President and lay out a roadmap for House Democrats to now pursue various investigations. Most important thing we learned from this hearing is that the President's legal problems have metastasized far beyond this special counsel investigation, and what he should be most concerned about is what is going on in the Southern District of New York, where federal prosecutors we knew they were looking into campaign finance violations, they have several cooperating witnesses who implicate the President in directing this scheme to violate campaign finance laws, but now we've also learned there were other investigations that we still don't know about, in addition to the fact that they're looking into the President's last conversation with Michael Cohen. He couldn't even discuss what the two men talked about, because that is the subject of an ongoing investigation, raising questions about possible obstruction or even witness tampering.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Judiciary Committee chairman in the House said today, for him, all this amounts to obstruction of justice and, in fact, I think he's calling about sixty different individuals to try to come testify. Where does this go next?  PAULA REID: We are going to really shift the focus from the special counsel, everyone's going to be on high alert once again for that final report, but what's going on in Manhattan, that's what's really going to matter. Those crimes are also probably more easy to prove since you have cooperating witnesses and oftentimes they may not be the sexiest crimes, right, possible tax fraud or insurance fraud but they're much easier to prove because they're paperwork crimes. On a parallel track, House Democrats are going to go full steam ahead calling all of these witnesses and continuing to seek corroborating documents for what Michael Cohen said, seeing if they can sort of, you know, confirm his story. But so far, it appears that the special counsel's report may not come for a few more weeks.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we heard from Adam Schiff, the chairman of House Intelligence, this allegation of money laundering on behalf of Russia through the Trump Organization but he admitted he had no proof of that thus far.  PAULA REID: That's a pretty big bomb to lob without any corroboration. I also take issue with his claim that he has evidence of collusion. He seemed to be conflated contact with collusion. He says what happened at Trump Tower was collusion. He's pointing to e-mails.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  PAULA REID: Nothing was exchanged there. Same with the meeting that Paul Manafort had with Konstantin Kilimnik, exchanging polling data, we know there was contact, we know that, but we don't know what they did with that polling data. So we certainly have evidence of contact, but a criminal conspiracy? So far, there has not been sufficient proof for anyone to be charged in that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a really quick break and come back in just a moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with our political panel. David Nakamura, I want to ask you about the President's speech, the longest of his presidency--  DAVID NAKAMURA: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --just yesterday at CPAC, a lot of different headlines in there.  DAVID NAKAMURA: A lot of different headlines.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. But-- but for you, I mean, what stood out? What was the purpose in this almost two-hour long speech?  DAVID NAKAMURA: I mean, it seemed like, you know, greatest hits he went through a lot of things that he's talked about before and, of course, demonized the investigations into his campaign conduct and so on. And-- but what struck me was the length of this event, but also the setting of the event, you know, with the crowd that really does seem to genuinely support the President and really love the President. Seemed like he was coming back from a summit that had collapsed, he had a hearing with Michael Cohen when he was out of the country and was hard for him to sort of, you know, come back like he'd like to do in real time. And now he had a lot to get off his chest. And so, you know, he went through bit by bit all the folks who he felt as a threat to him and that's what he does, which is attack.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: It was a greatest hits compilation; and I-- I was thinking-- watching it I was thinking he had been so buttoned up comparatively speaking in Hanoi. You have to hit your marks, you have to say certain things and he's not disciplined in that way. He gets in front of a home audience, a home-- a home field advantage, and everything pours out. All the repressed observations that he wanted to make.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Including profanity.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Including profanity, including everything. It was the longest speech in presidential history, if you actually want to call it a speech, I don't know if technically it counts as a speech in terms of its organization. But it was, we believe, the longest time-- longest public speaking event of a President in history.  DAVID SANGER: The other oddity was he was a President who we thought might be using Hanoi as a way to divert from the-- from the Cohen testimony, and then he shows up basically having to divert from the fact that he had come back from Hanoi with nothing against, you know, a tiny country that, you know, has a fraction of the power of the United States, so he is, as David says, back to his greatest hits.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: It took him about one hour and fifty minutes even to get to North Korea from a (INDISTINCT)) in the speech.  DAVID SANGER: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. But it's-- it's interesting, David, because the Washington Post has a headline today saying the acquiescence to Trump is now the GOP's defining trait. I mean is that how you read that speech yesterday before CPAC?  DAVID SANGER: Well, I think one of the remarkable things about the Republican Party is that in the run-up to the election, you had all these people trying to separate themselves from President Trump, and now they've determined he's their candidate for the next election, so they have to line themselves up. And I think the long historical question here is is the Republican Party going to be over the long-term more like a party that President Trump has defined--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  DAVID SANGER: --or more like the traditional Republicans that President Trump defeated for the nomination? And I don't think they've really decided internally within the party the answer to that and I think much of it depends on how the investigation turns out.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Paula, you're seeing Republicans line up behind the President and defending him against these investigations as well. I mean, you have Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, out there on the attack against Adam Schiff, who's--  PAULA REID: Absolutely.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --who's leading the House Intelligence--  PAULA REID: And look at the Cohen hearing, right? Everyone else was seeming to audition for that role of-- of fixer. Republicans weren't able to really, except for one exception, grill him on the substance of his allegations, many of which were extremely damning and said they just went after his credibility, sort of doing what-- what Cohen used to do for the President.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff, switching gears a bit, but perhaps not thematically. At this presidential--  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: I'm curious now.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The-- the President's press conference in Hanoi he was asked about a number of things, a number of topics, including what's happening in Israel right now.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And his friend, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicted. Typically, ahead of an election, an American President would say I don't want to wade in.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: President jumped in.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Typically. President-- President jumped in. Netanyahu, who's become-- like many foreign leaders, more Trumpian as he's watched this new model of-- of leadership, and I think President Trump is quite nervous about watching what would happen to a prime minister of an Allied country under indictment. We are facing an interesting moment, Netanyahu's been prime minister for a decade, and this is just his second run. He might be through. That's not good news for-- for Donald Trump. It's not good news for his party. The thing about Netanyahu--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: --one of the many similarities they have is do not count either man out.  MARGARET BRENNAN: No.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Do not count Netanyahu out yet.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. We'll see you next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-highest ranking Democrat in the Senate, denounced President Trump's tweets on Sunday about four progressive congresswomen of color, calling the comments \"careless rhetoric\" designed to sow division. \u00a0 \"I could just tell you that when we are dealing with mass arrests or mass deportations and that kind of careless rhetoric by the president, it doesn't help one bit,\" Durbin said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\u00a0 Although he did not name them specifically, Mr. Trump on Sunday morning posted a series of tweets deriding \"'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen,\" alluding to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who've been engaged in a public intra-party dispute with Democratic leaders in the House, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \"So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.\"\u00a0 \"These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!\" the president added.\u00a0 The comments drew quick and scathing condemnation from Democrats in Congress and those hoping to challenge Mr. Trump in the general presidential election next year. Like others in her party who accused the president of stoking racial animus, Pelosi called the remarks \"xenophobic.\"\u00a0 Some also pointed to the factual inaccuracies in Mr. Trump's comments. He claimed that the four Democratic congresswomen \"originally came\" from foreign countries but only Omar was born outside the U.S. Pressley, an African American, was born in Ohio. Ocasio-Cortez, of Puerto Rican heritage, was born in New York. Tlaib, the daughter of Palestinian immigrants, was born in Detroit.\u00a0 Omar, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in Somalia, a country she and her family fled from because of a civil war and ethnic strife. They stayed in a refugee camp in Kenya before settling in the U.S. when she was 10 years old, and she became a citizen at 17. To push back on the president's comments, Durbin highlighted Omar's story \u2014 which he suggested serves as concrete validation of America's ethos.\u00a0 \"The fact that they went through refugee camps, came the United States, clawed their way into an existence and eventually were elected. Thank goodness,\" he said. \"That is part of what America holds as a dream for people around the world and the president should not diminish it.\"\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Let's say you had nodded off for a long, if chilly, nap on the banks of the Moscow River 10 years ago.\u00a0 How different a world would you wake up to now? Within the Kremlin walls, not very different at all, notes correspondent Mark Phillips: Vladimir Putin was re-elected twice in this past decade, and will be in office until 2024, at least. But the world outside those walls is a different place because of him. It's certainly different in the Crimea, the Ukrainian province he invaded and annexed in 2014.  And it's tragic for the 298 people who died on the Malaysia Airlines plane shot down over Ukraine by a Russian missile.  And Putin's influence is felt well beyond Eastern Europe, particularly in the last U.S. presidential election, where he's accused of sanctioning an internet troll campaign against Hillary Clinton \u2013 accused by just about everybody but the U.S. president. \"They said they think it's Russia,\" Mr. Trump said in Helsinki in July 2018. \"I have President Putin, he just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be.\" The American president's relationship with the Russian leader has seemed better than with old allies, says Pulitzer Prize-winning writer on European affairs, Anne Applebaum. \"Putin set out on a strategy that seems on the face of it incredible,\" said Applebaum. \"He decided that what he wanted to do was break up the European Union, break up NATO, and get the United States to leave Europe. It's pretty clear that the U.S. president admires Putin in a way that he does not admire American allies.\" If there was one picture that summed up the misery of the decade, it was this one: The body of Aylan Kurdi, a three-year-old Kurdish-Syrian refugee, washed up on a Mediterranean beach.\u00a0  Hundreds of thousands fled endless wars in the Middle East and poverty in Africa. And when they made their way through Europe, they triggered an anti-immigrant backlash, and the rise of populist leaders, including Viktor Orban in Hungary and Matteo Salvini in Italy.  Protection of borders was part of what drove the Brexit vote in Britain that is taking the U.K. out of the European Union. And if it was a hot decade in politics, real temperatures rose as well. The consequences of global warming \u2013 heatwaves, droughts, flooding caused by melting in the polar regions \u2013 will occur more often.  \"There are several spots around here, around Antarctica, that are believed to be in this irreversible situation,\" said scientist Ken Taylor. All this, no matter what the pleas of a schoolgirl who has become the unlikely face of a new international movement.  \"My name is Greta Thunberg, I am 16 years old, I come from Sweden, and I want you to panic.\" The last decade has had its diversions: An American actress, Megan Markle, married into the British royal family, and discovered there is no preparation for the kind of scrutiny that involves. But that napper by the Moscow River might be relieved to see that the Queen is still on the throne.\u00a0 In a world of change, some things stay the same.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Story produced by Mikaela Bufano.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 See also:\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Visit Washington's National Archives with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and you'll see how just how excited she gets by the past, as when she looked at the Emancipation Proclamation \u2013 President Abraham Lincoln's Civil War order freeing slaves held in Confederate states.\u00a0  \"This is the mother of all executive orders,\" she laughed.  \"I love that you just jumped up and down! That's awesome,\" laughed correspondent Mo Rocca.  \"Abraham Lincoln was worried when he went to sign this Emancipation Proclamation, because that morning he had shaken hundreds of hands,\" Goodwin said. \"So, when he went to sign his name, his own hand was numb and shaking.\u00a0 \"He put down the pen. He said, 'If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act. But if I sign with a shaking hand, posterity will say he hesitated.' So, he waited and waited. And look at that hand! It is a very bold, clear hand.\" His was a steady hand. But these days, steady doesn't exactly describe the nation's mood. \u00a0 \"People will come up to me and say, 'Can you please tell me that these are not the worst of times?'\" Goodwin laughed. \"People do want to have some history, and I can assure them we've been through far worse times before.\" Rocca asked, \"What person or period would you recommend that people read about for context?\" \"I think the best context to what's happening now and really what produced Trump's election is to look back at the turn of the 20th century,\" she replied. \"What you had there is so much like [what] we have now: You had an Industrial Revolution that shook up the economy, much as globalization and the tech revolution have done today.\" There may be no bigger cheerleader for history than David Rubenstein, though he will tell you, \"I'm not a historian, I'm not a great scholar. I'm not a scholar at all.\"\u00a0 But roam through the National Archives with Rubenstein and he turns into a veritable tour guide. The billionaire financier is right at home here \u2013 as is his personal copy of the Magna Carta, the 13th century English charter establishing the principle that everyone is subject to the law, and guaranteeing rights to individuals.\u00a0 Rubenstein bought it in 2007; it's on permanent loan to the Archives. \"This is the only copy in the United States,\" he told Rocca. \"And I thought it was important because it was the inspiration for the Declaration of Independence and many of the things that we stand for in our country.\" Rubenstein, the co-founder and co-chairman of the Carlyle Group, has cut checks for more than $200 million not just for historic documents, but to preserve sites like Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, and to restore the Washington Monument after it was damaged in a 2011 earthquake.\u00a0 Rubenstein said, \"I'm now in a position to give back to my country. And that's what I've tried to do through what I call patriotic philanthropy \u2013 try to remind people of the history and the heritage of our country, the good and the bad.\" He is now sharing his love of American history with the women and men who have the power to change it: Members of Congress. Over the last six years, he's invited lawmakers to the Library of Congress to hear him interview eminent historians about great leaders. \"We get between 250 and 300 people coming each time we have one of these events,\" Rubenstein said. \"Half of those are Members of Congress.\" \"That's a lot of members of Congress!\" Rocca said.\u00a0 Some of the talks are featured in Rubenstein's new book, \"The American Story,\" published by Simon & Schuster (a division of CBS).  \"What we've learned over thousands of years is that history repeats itself,\" Rubenstein said. \"And if you can find the solutions that people came up with or the mistakes they made in trying to deal with these problems, you're probably going to avoid some of the mistakes that people made in the past.\" Historian David McCullough, who has won Pulitzers writing about two presidents he sees as exemplars of honor \u2013 Harry S. Truman and John Adams \u2013 said, \"Honor was very important. It's in our basic documents. And we don't talk much about honor anymore.\" Rocca asked, \"What is it?\" \"That's a good question. I'd say it's doing what we know is right for the betterment of our country.\" Visiting New York's Mount Vernon Hotel Museum, a property once owned by Adams' daughter, McCullough said, \"Adams is still underrated, still underappreciated. There's no statue, no memorial to John Adams in Washington. First founding father who became president, who never owned a slave. On purpose.\" \"Right. And that's a big deal,\" Rocca said.  \"You bet it is!\"\u00a0 Adams wasn't perfect; he signed into law the Alien and Sedition Acts, some of the harshest anti-immigrant and censorship measures in the nation's history.\u00a0 But our historians say the tendency to fixate on the flaws of past leaders is blinding us to their larger accomplishments. Goodwin said, \"We can look back at Abraham Lincoln and say he didn't believe in intermarriage, or he didn't believe that blacks should have the right to vote. And, of course, you wish he didn't believe that way. But he also did the Emancipation Proclamation. \"We can look at FDR, and it will be forever a stain on his legacy about not letting more Jewish refugees into the country, incarcerating the Japanese-Americans. And yet, he won the Allied victory in World War II. He got us through the Depression.\u00a0 \"We're so anxious to see the imperfections of the past that we're forgetting the good things of the past,\" she said. \"And then they no longer can teach us anything.\" \"To use modern parlance, you can't cancel the past,\" Rocca said.  \"You can't cancel the past!\"\u00a0 As for the present, McCullough says it's not too soon to evaluate the current commander-in-chief. Rocca asked, \"How do you think history is going to judge President Trump?\" \"Very badly,\" McCullough replied. \"It's self-evident in our own time. We don't have to wait for history. It's the most disappointing, grotesque image of the presidency in our whole story, our whole history. Never have we had more right to be very concerned.\" However, David Rubinstein isn't ready to render a verdict on President Trump: \u00a0\"I think it's too early to say how any president will be judged, because you have to wait 'til their term is over.\"\u00a0 Looking at the current field of Democratic challengers, Doris Kearns Goodwin is concerned with how we choose the next president. \"One of the things that Lincoln said, even though he was good at the debates and he could speak extemporaneously, once he got to be president, he hardly ever wanted to speak spontaneously. He only wanted to wait to be prepared, because he said, 'Words matter. When you're president, your words carry weight.'\" Rocca asked McCullough, \"Let me play the cynic for one minute here and say, 'You know what? Anyone who runs for president must have a mighty high opinion of themselves. Gotta be a narcissist by definition.'\" McCullough said, \"No. They can feel responsibility: 'If no one else is stepping up and saying what needs to be said or doing what needs to be done, I'll do it.'\u00a0 That's the person I want. Male, female, black, white, Asian, you name it. That doesn't matter.\"\u00a0 And for all of his concerns, McCullough remains an optimist. \"We're just getting started,\" he said of our country. \"That's the way I feel. Two hundred years is nothing!\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For more info: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Story produced by Michelle Kessel.",

            "article_content": "New York\u00a0\u2014 A series of Facebook video ads for President Trump's re-election efforts shows what appears to be a young woman strolling on a beach in Florida, a Hispanic man on a city street in Texas and a bearded hipster in a coffee shop in Washington, D.C., all making glowing, voice-over endorsements of the president. \"I could not ask for a better president,\" intones the voice during slow-motion footage of the smiling blonde called\u00a0\"Tracey from Florida.\"\u00a0A man labeled on another video as\u00a0\"AJ from Texas\"\u00a0stares into the camera as a voice says, \"Although I am a lifelong Democrat, I sincerely believe that a nation must secure its borders.\" There's just one problem: The people in the videos that ran in the past few months are all actually models in stock video footage produced far from the U.S. in France, Brazil and Turkey, and available to anyone online for a fee. Though the 20-second videos include tiny disclaimers that say \"actual testimonial, actor portrayal,\" they raise the question why a campaign that can fill arenas with supporters would have to buy stock footage of models. It's a practice that, under different circumstances, Mr. Trump himself would likely blast as \"fake news.\" The ads were paid for by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, according to the ad labeling. Trump campaign officials declined repeated requests for comment on Tuesday. Political experts say that, while it's not unusual for stock footage to find its way into ads, a presidential campaign should have been more careful. \"As a producer, you want to control \u2014 you want people to look a certain way and you want them to sound a certain way,\" said Jay Newell, a former cable TV executive who teaches advertising at Iowa State University. \"The fact that the footage is from outside the U.S. makes it that much more embarrassing.\" There are plenty examples of such gaffes. In the last presidential primaries, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio ran an ad titled \"Morning in America\" with shots from Canada. A super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush put ads on TV with video reportedly from the English countryside and workers from Southeast Asia. Mr. Trump himself has used video from abroad before. His 2016 TV ad vowing to build a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico showed people streaming across the border \u2014 but the shots of refugees were taken in Morocco. The existence of the stock footage in this series of Trump ads, reported last week by Judd Legum for his website\u00a0Popular Information, underscores an increasingly aggressive, targeted approach by the Trump campaign to reach out to voters on Facebook. The Trump Make America Great Again Committee, which was behind the testimonial videos, is by far the biggest spender on political Facebook advertising, shelling out more than $2.7 million on 27,735 ads in the last 90 days alone, according to the social network's running\u00a0database\u00a0of campaign ad spending. That's in addition to the more than $1 million spent on more than 14,500 ads in the same period by Donald J. Trump for President Inc. Mr. Trump's campaign gets to such totals by running the same ads numerous times, all at slightly different audiences. \"Thomas from Washington,\"\u00a0featuring the bearded young man behind a coffee shop counter, appeared aimed at evangelicals, with the voice-over quote saying the president and his family are \"in our prayers for strength and wisdom from God almighty.\" \u2033AJ from Texas\" seemed focused on Hispanic men. And \"Tracey in Florida\" was aimed specifically at a demographic in which Trump is historically weak \u2014 young women. All are models for Turkish, Brazilian and French companies, respectively, that supply hundreds of photos and video to the popular site iStock run by Getty Images, which caters to publications, filmmakers and advertisers looking for professional, inexpensive imagery. According to the site, licenses for the video clips used in the Trump ads can be had for as little as $170. The\u00a0blonde on the beach\u00a0appears to be particularly prolific. Her photos and videos from the French company Tuto Photos in Roubaix, France, show her twirling in a wedding gown, walking spaniels in a meadow, getting her teeth checked at the dentist and working in a warehouse. And the star of iStock's\u00a0\"Bearded and tattooed hipster coffee shop owner posing\"\u00a0\u2014 also known as Trump's \"Thomas from Washington\" \u2014 is a fixture on the videos and photos contributed by the company GM Stock out of Izmir, Turkey. His unmistakable beard and tats can be seen on the image site strolling with a woman on the beach, sitting by a campfire and pumping iron in the gym. So what do these models think of being held up as model Trump supporters? That's not clear because none of the companies they've posed for would give a detailed comment to The Associated Press. A spokeswoman for Getty Images would not identify the models, citing privacy concerns. Fred Davis, a campaign consultant who's produced ads for George W. Bush and other Republican presidential candidates, said the Trump campaign's use of such footage is not surprising, given the volume of political ads on the internet these days. \"Whoever did this is probably 22 years old, and they're going through pictures and thought, 'This is a great picture,'\" Davis said. \"This is a great shot of Thomas from Washington. It's a shame it's not Thomas from Washington.\"",

            "article_content": "Benghazi, Libya -- Forces loyal to the United Nations-backed government in western Libya repelled on Friday a rival leader's attempt to seize the capital, Tripoli, raising fears of renewed civil war in the oil-rich nation. Militiamen commanded by renegade general Khalifa Hifter were pushed back from a key checkpoint less than 17 miles from Tripoli, the seat of the government backed by most of the Western world. Amid fears of a new full-scale conflict in the divided North African nation, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres shuttled between the two sides, trying to broker a peace. Since the 2011 civil war that led to the toppling and murder of longtime Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi, Libya has been divided in two, with rival governments in east and west. An array of mostly Islamic extremist groups, along with criminal gangs, have all capitalized on the chaos for almost a decade, carving out small fiefdoms and running weapon and human trafficking rings.  Thousands of refugees from the rest of Africa and beyond have made their way to Libya's coast in hopes of making the relatively short boat crossing to Italy, and thousands have died trying. Hifter, with his Libyan National Army (LNA) defenders, is based in the eastern city of Torbruq, while the nation's capital city Tripoli is home to the U.N.-backed Government of the National Accord (GNA), led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. Social media accounts that back al-Sarraj's government said Friday that he had signed a decree ordering airstrikes and the use of military force in defense of \"civilians and critical facilities against terrorists, criminal groups.\" Earlier this week, Hifter announced that his forces were marching west on Tripoli, to \"liberate\" the capital. The Kremlin has meanwhile denied providing any support for the renegade general, and called for restraint. The prospect of a renewed fighting comes as U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres is visiting Libya. He has extended his stay in the country after arriving in the east where he first met the LNA commander. Guterres said on Twitter that his, \"aim remains the same: avoid a military confrontation. I reiterate that there is no military solution for the Libyan crisis, only a political one.\" The European Parliament warned on Friday that the LNA's move on the capital could lead the country back into civil war. It would also put at risk upcoming peace talks between Libyan rivals brokered by the U.N. and aimed at drawing a roadmap for new national elections. Those talks are due April 14-16. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency closed-door meeting on Friday afternoon at Britain's request to discuss the unfolding developments. Several governments and organizations urged de-escalation, including those known to be Hifter's key backers such as France and the United Arab Emirates, without specifically mentioning the commander.  France, Britain, the U.S., the UAE and Italy said in a joint statement Friday that \"military posturing and threats of unilateral action only risk propelling Libya back toward chaos.\" Italy's interior minister, Matteo Salvini, warned that the stability along the southern rim of the Mediterranean Sea is in danger, with Algeria also in turmoil following the uprising against its longtime ailing president. Russia, which has thrown its support behind Hifter in the past, distanced itself from the offensive. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any support for the Libyan commander and emphasized the need \"to avoid actions that would lead to the resumption of bloodshed.\"",

            "article_content": "Plymouth, N.H. \u2014 Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke spent the past week driving himself to some three dozen events across six states \u2014 finding an elevated surface on which to stand at nearly each stop \u2014 as part of his \"show up everywhere,\" high-endurance campaign for the presidency.  Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren began the week with a nationally televised town hall in Mississippi, part of a methodical campaign swing through southern states to pitch her new affordable housing plan. Her call there to abolish the electoral college set off a national debate and perhaps a new litmus test for her Democratic competitors. Warren has introduced the most policy proposals into the 2020 presidential contest, including a universal child care program, a tax on the \"ultra wealthy,\" and a plan to break up the big tech companies. But O'Rourke, who launched his campaign last week, raised $6.1 million in the first 24 hours with an average contribution of $48, besting every candidate in the field and far outpacing Warren.  The headlines made by Warren, 69, and O'Rourke, 46, this week highlight a choice that has been particularly vexing for the Democratic Party: whether to go big on policy or personality. But the choice in the 2020 primary has taken on a new dimension, as party voters measure the candidates not so much against one another but against President Donald Trump. In the early stages of the campaign, Democratic voters have already concluded\u00a0that defeating Mr. Trump is their first priority. But they are just starting to assess which candidate in the vast Democratic field offers the most effective contrast to the current president. \"I don't think the policy differences between all of them are that vast,\" said Fred Nemeth, a restaurant owner from Bartlett. \"There is an existential threat in the White House and we need to remove that.\" Since her\u00a0first campaign stop earlier this year, Warren has centered the rationale for her candidacy on the economy. \"Today in America, a full-time minimum-wage job will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty,\" she tells voters of why she is running. She often begins her stump speeches by recalling a scene from her childhood, when her father had a debilitating heart attack that forced her mother to find a minimum wage job at Sears, a job that \"saved our house, but more importantly, it saved our family.\" O'Rourke begins his stump speeches by speaking of his home town of El Paso, which he describes as \"one of the safest cities of the United States of America \u2014 safe not in spite of the fact that we are city of immigrants but safe because we are a city of immigrants.\" The former congressman built a national profile by running against Ted Cruz for the U.S. Senate last year. And even though he lost, he often invokes that contest as a reason to seek for higher office, noting he came within three points of defeating a Republican in a red Texas and quadrupled young voter turnout in the process.  If Warren, a former Harvard Law professor, is leading the charge on big policy prescriptions in the Democratic primary, O'Rourke sees himself as more of a student, invoking people he meets on the trail and the education they provide him.  \"There is a lot to learn and the best way to learn is to listen to those who understand these issues first hand from their their lives,\" he told CBS News after a stop at Plymouth State University. \"And that's why we are showing up everywhere.\"  While O'Rourke has been criticized for not offering specific proposals of his own \u2014 often simply agreeing to ideas suggested by others, or reversing course on previous positions, like means testing for social security \u2014 he is not without a platform. During his swing through each of New Hampshire's 10 counties this week, he spoke of the ways in which climate change will eventually create a refugee crisis.  He also backs a ban on assault weapons and supports expanded background checks, as well as universal pre-K. He called for criminal prosecution of pharmaceutical company executives involved in the opioid crisis and for the legalization of marijuana. He supports a federal $15 minimum wage. He advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, often citing the financial and humanitarian burden of decades-long wars. And he told reporters that he prefers more regulation of tech companies instead of breaking them up, as Warren has proposed. He also rejected donations from corporate political action committees  in his Senate campaign, which has now become something of a requirement for entry in the 2020 presidential primary. \"My vision for the country is something I offer and introduce at every stop,\" O'Rourke told reporters when asked about the lack of policy ideas on his website. \"And [voters'] vision for the country is something I listen to at every meeting and every stop and I will continue to do that.\" He also acknowledges that his ability to do that comes from a position of privilege. In an interview with the New York Times this week, Andrew Gillum, who lost a narrow race for Florida governor last year, said O'Rourke \"enjoys a set of privileges in his decision making that other candidates don't. Can you imagine it for any of the women that are in the race for president or considering a run?\"  Asked by reporters whether that assessment was true, O'Rourke was blunt: \"Yes.\"  \"As a white man in this country there are a set of circumstances that are different than they are for women, than they are for people of color,\" he said after a town hall at a brewery in Conway. \"It's incumbent upon me to recognize that and to ensure that this campaign reflects the genius of the country.\"  While both Warren and O'Rourke have national recognition, voters appear to have a firmer sense of the Massachusetts senator's positions. And that dynamic has opportunities and liabilities for each of them. \"I'm not one of those people that expects him to have a plan for every contingency. We know how that came out last time,\" said Slavek Grzelkowski, a retiree from Melvin Village who came to see O'Rourke in Conway. Grzelkowski said voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary, but is now looking for other options. Now, he's interested in Sens. Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar and found O'Rourke to be an \"inspirational, energetic man.\" Warren, he said, \"has a lot of expertise up front, and not enough listening.\" Patricia Rice, an academic specialist from Laconia, said she wants someone with young blood. \"I want someone who understands, better than Donald Trump, what the heck is going on here,\" she said after seeing O'Rourke in Plymouth. \"When you're only talking policy, that's where Bernie went wrong. Wouldn't it be great to have free education? Yes, but that was an overreach, and it turned a lot of people off.\" Eileen Copeland of East Conway said O'Rourke \"sometimes feels a little wishy-washy. I want to see some more strength out of him. Especially if he's going to go up against Trump, which is the thing I'm measuring everybody against. I think Trump could maybe brow beat him in a debate.\"  On Warren, Copeland said \"I love all of her policy issues. I just hate to say, sometimes she's very professorial. I want the young, I don't want another septuagenarian in there. But she's great in policy, she'd be great to have on the team.\"  Copeland said she is very interested in Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor from South Bend, Indiana, and finds him to be effectively balancing policy and personality. \"Watching Elizabeth Warren on CNN, I was like, 'Oh Beto better start talking about policy,'\" said Fran Arsenault, a realtor who came to see O'Rourke in Keene, referring to the senator's televised town hall this week. \"But I think that will come.\" \"The field is wide and far,\" said Reed Van Rossum, a teacher from Bartlett, who came to learn more about O'Rourke in Conway. \"This is like showing up to Thanksgiving dinner where there are so many plates on the table I don't know where to start.\" Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Jerusalem -- The United States has officially shuttered its consulate in Jerusalem, downgrading the status of its main diplomatic mission to the Palestinians by folding it into the U.S. Embassy to Israel. For decades, the consulate functioned as a de facto embassy to the Palestinians. Now, that outreach will be handled by a Palestinian affairs unit, under the command of the embassy. The symbolic shift hands authority over U.S. diplomatic channels with the West Bank and Gaza to Ambassador David Friedman. The Trump bankruptcy-lawyer-turned diplomat has made personal financial contributions to Israeli settlements in the West Bank, notes CBS \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan, which has led to strong distrust among Palestinians. Consolidating contact with the Palestinians under his control will only add to doubts that the Trump administration will be a fair broker in the long-awaited peace process being brokered by presidential son-in-law and envoy Jared Kushner. The announcement from the State Department came early Monday in Jerusalem, with the \"merger\" effective the same day. \"This decision was driven by our global efforts to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our diplomatic engagements and operations,\" State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said in a statement. \"It does not signal a change of U.S. policy on Jerusalem, the West Bank, or the Gaza Strip.\" When first announced by U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo in October, the move infuriated Palestinians, fueling their suspicions that the U.S. was recognizing Israeli control over east Jerusalem and the West Bank, territories that Palestinians seek for a future state. Palestinian official Saeb Erekat called the move \"the final nail in the coffin\" for the U.S. role in peacemaking. The downgrade is just the latest in a string of divisive decisions by the Trump administration that have backed Israel and alienated the Palestinians, who say they have lost faith in the U.S. administration's role as arbiter in any peace process. Last year the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocated its embassy there, upending U.S. policy toward one of the most explosive issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians in turn cut off most ties with the administration. The administration also has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, including assistance to hospitals and peace-building programs. It has cut funding to the U.N. agency that provides aid to Palestinians classified as refugees. Last fall, it shut down the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington. The Trump administration has cited the reluctance of Palestinian leaders to enter peace negotiations with Israel as the reason for such punitive measures, although the U.S. has yet to present its much-anticipated but still mysterious \"Deal of the Century\" to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Kushner announced last month that the U.S. would unveil the deal after Israeli elections in April. The Palestinian Authority has preemptively rejected the plan, accusing the U.S. of bias toward Israel.",

            "article_content": "Priscilla Chan doesn't do a lot of interviews. As she put it, she'd rather be doing the work.\u00a0 The pediatrician, billionaire philanthropist, mother and wife of Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is on an ambitious mission to level the playing field for everyone as part of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, one of the most well-funded philanthropic organizations in the world. Their ambitious goals include tackling global health and trying to cure and end all diseases by the end of the century. \"Well, if you think about it, penicillin didn't exist 80 years ago \u2026 it's not linear \u2026 the microscope changed the world. Our ability to sequence DNA changed the world \u2026 We are not the ones doing it. We are empowering scientists to actually be in the forefront and making those discoveries,\" Chan told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Norah O'Donnell. \u00a0 \"At the heart of it \u2026 I'm a practitioner. I've worked in the classroom, I've worked in the clinic. And that's where I get the inspiration and the nurturing from my soul that I need, as well as being able to see and stay connected to what we need to keep our eye on in order to build a better future,\" Chan said.\u00a0 But long before she was a Harvard graduate and doctor heading up one of the largest philanthropic efforts in the world, she was the child of Chinese-Vietnamese refugees who came to the United States in the 1970s in search of a better future. \"My grandparents did something I think is completely courageous \u2026 they put their kids on a boat and watched that boat drift off to sea,\" she said. \"We know very first-hand that hardship is real and opportunities are available but not available to everyone.\" \u00a0 But those opportunities led Chan to Harvard University on a full scholarship. At first, it felt like an alien world. She nearly left. \"I think I immediately knew when I showed up on campus that something out of this world had happened \u2026 but I wanted to give up. But I also found a home running an after-school program \u2026 and when I saw what those kids faced in challenges, far beyond what I faced, and I saw what needed to be done I knew I had to stay,\" she said. \u00a0 She met the man who would become her husband and one of the most powerful tech executives in the world, just four weeks into college. Asked if it was love at first sight, Chan said, \"He just had a totally different mentality in terms of being able to do things and take risks than I did. And I thought he was fascinating. But he was 18. I didn't think I was gonna marry him.\"  They eventually did marry in 2012 and now have two daughters and a Hungarian sheepdog named Beast. \u00a0 \"Even before I had met Mark I knew I had received more than I could have ever imagined and it was going to be my life's work to make sure that was true for others,\" Chan said, getting a little teary-eyed. \"It means a lot to me.\"  But 2018 proved to be the most challenging year yet for Facebook, her husband's company. The social media giant is facing a multibillion-dollar fine for a series of privacy scandals, including a massive data breach.  \u00a0 \"You know, we've done a lot of work in thinking about how we should be operating and Mark and his team has done a great job at Facebook. But for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, we also want to make sure that we are making good choices and being good stewards of the opportunity so it's an accelerator for us to really think through some of the harder problems,\" Chan said.  When O'Donnell asked if the initiative was a way to whitewash some of what the problems Facebook has faced, especially in 2018, she said, \"We've always known that we were gonna give back. And we launched, formally, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in 2015 \u2026 this is not a 2018 project. We are going to be doing this for decades \u2026 and frankly, there are a lot easier ways to build up PR than trying to tackle education reform or criminal justice reform.\" But whether their initiative or Facebook will have a greater impact on society, Chan said it's \"too soon to say.\" \"I hope the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is able to achieve its goals. But we have ambitious goals and so if we can cure, prevent and manage all disease, I think that will be astounding in itself,\" she said.  Chan flatly rejected the idea that her or her husband have political ambitions.  \u00a0 \"I don't even want to sit here to talk to you,\" Chan joked. \"We believe in advocacy, but we don't believe that we're the right people and our experience and voice should not be the most powerful in the room,\" she said. \u00a0 \u00a0 As for what her family thinks of the work she's doing, Chan said, \"You know what's funny? My mom is still like, 'Are you a real doctor yet? And do you still work as a doctor?' \u2026 But they are incredibly proud and excited about the work that we're doing \u2026 my mom's mainly just really proud.\" O'Donnell sat down with Chan before Monday's report from the British Parliament branding Facebook as \"digital gangsters.\" It accuses the social media giant of deliberately misleading an investigation into disinformation and \"the extent of Russian interference in foreign elections.\" A Facebook spokesperson told CBS News the company shares \"the committee's concerns about false news and election integrity,\" adding it is \"open to meaningful regulation\" and it has \"already made substantial changes.\" Tune in to \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday, Feb. 20, for more from Norah O'Donnell's interview with Priscilla Chan and to learn about an innovative program at an Oklahoma prison trying to break the cycle of mass incarceration.",

            "article_content": "Dakar, Senegal \u2014\u00a0A United Nations official said Thursday that 58 people drowned off the coast of Mauritania in one of the deadliest disasters this year among people trying to make the perilous journey to Europe. Scores more migrants were able to swim through the rough Atlantic Ocean waters to safety from the capsized boat.  The boat that left Gambia on November 27 had been carrying at least 150 people, including women and children. It was headed toward the Canary Islands when it tried to approach the Mauritanian coast to get fuel and food, Laura Lungarotti, chief of mission in the West African nation with the U.N. migration agency, told The Associated Press. \"Many drowned. The ones who survived swam up to the Mauritanian coast close to the city of Nouadhibou,\" she said. \"The Mauritanian authorities are very efficiently coordinating the response with the agencies currently present\" in the northern city. UPDATE: 58 drowned yesterday close to the Mauritanian shores. Mauritanian authorities, IOM and HCR working to assist the survivors, while Gambian consular authorities also present to extend protection to their nationals. https://t.co/UNDqyRDVsG At least 83 people swam to shore, the agency said. An unknown number of injured were taken to the hospital in Nouadhibou. It was not immediately clear whether anyone remained missing. There was no immediate statement from authorities in Gambia, where tens of thousands of people have set off in hopes of reaching Europe in recent years. Despite the country's small size, more than 35,000 Gambians arrived in Europe between 2014 and 2018, according to the U.N. migration agency. A 22-year oppressive rule by former President Yahya Jammeh severely affected the country's economy, especially for youth, and contributed greatly to the exodus. Since Jammeh fled into exile in January 2017 after a surprise election loss, European countries have been pushing to return asylum seekers. But Gambia's economy still suffers. The coastal nation was shaken earlier this year by the collapse of British travel company Thomas Cook. At the time, Gambia's tourism minister said the government convened an emergency meeting on the collapse, while some Gambians said the shutdown could have a devastating impact on tourism, which contributes more than 30% of the country's GDP. Over the last couple years, as European Union nations have spent millions of dollars cutting off land routes through North Africa for migrants to try and make the shorter sea crossing to Italy or Greece, thousands of migrants have tried to reach the Canaries, a chain of Spanish islands off the Moroccan coast. It is considered a launchpad for migrants seeking asylum in  mainland Europe.",

            "article_content": "With almost a year until the 2020 presidential election, Facebook is unveiling new safety and transparency protocols in order to better safeguard the U.S. election process and ensure the misinformation campaign that rocked the 2016 election is not repeated. \u00a0 Facebook was just one of they key players in the Russian effort to sow discord\u00a0and dissension in the U.S. during the 2016 race. In the lead-up to the 2016 elections, Russian troll farms were allowed to troll and spread misinformation on Facebook's sites, with various actors using the platform to target vulnerable populations, discourage voting and stir white nationalism. The company received widespread criticism for not better preventing acts of foreign influence in the democratic process.\u00a0 According to testimony by top intelligence chiefs, U.S. officials believed the Kremlin sought to directly interfere in the U.S. election and pave the way for a Trump presidency, and one tactic of the multi-pronged attack was a wave of misinformation.   The tech giant rolled out\u00a0three key initiatives\u00a0Monday as part of their effort to prevent interference in the 2020 election: In the aftermath of the 2016 election, Facebook repeatedly vowed to be more transparent and proactive about removing questionable and potentially harmful posts as a means to regain the trust of its millions of users. But just this month, Facebook once again came under fire for\u00a0allowing political ads that contained unsubstantiated claims. The company recently ran an ad from the Trump reelection campaign that accused former vice president Joe Biden of corruption \u2014 but the accusation hasn't been proven, and the Biden campaign asked for the ad to be taken down. Facebook, however, declined to do so.\u00a0Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg concluded that banning political ads altogether would be comparable to censoring free speech. \"I know many people disagree, but in general I don't think it's right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,\" he said in a speech earlier this month, adding that other major tech platforms have run similarly misleading ads. Hate speech has been an issue for the social media platform in an increasingly divisive America. Such speech has even rocked the federal government, after a ProPublica report revealed the existence of a Facebook group in which U.S. Border Patrol agents made lewd and incendiary comments about elected officials, including freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be more effective, the company vowed this past summer to dedicate some content moderators to hate speech alone. All come from the more than 20,000 outsourced content moderators who screen the platform. Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

White nationalism, Castro told CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe in an interview at the Iowa State Fair, is a growing threat that's translating into domestic terrorism.\u00a0 Castro said his plan aims to fight white nationalism and gun violence not just through stricter gun control laws and additional funding for combatting domestic terrorism, but by investing in cross-cultural exchanges so people have a better understanding of those who are different from them.\u00a0 \"I think that we can catch it sooner, before it actually turns into violence,\" the former Housing and Urban Development secretary said.\u00a0 \"We can prevent it by making sure that these weapons of war are not on the street. We can also ensure that we have better tools to investigate something once it happens. I think, when we're talking about changing the hearts and the minds of people that are headed down the road of white nationalism, that means that we have to be better about ensuring that people are exposed to different ideas and different types of people in our country.\" The Latino community, Castro said, has been contributing to the United States' success for generations, and everyone has to push back against any kind of scapegoating of the Latino community or viewing them as other. Even in 2019, the Latino community is often an invisible one, Castro said.\u00a0 Castro also said that there is a pervasive fear and anxiety in the Latino community because so many have heard racist comments in passing.\u00a0 \"All of us have experienced that, I mean I can't tell you how many times in my time in public service I've experienced that, whether it's from Twitter or through emails or every now and then, a letter,\" Castro said.\u00a0 \"Somebody will say 'dirty Mexican, go back where you came from.'

            "article_content": "New Delhi -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set to win a second term in office as his Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) racked up an overwhelming majority of the votes being counted across India on Thursday. The tallying of votes in the world's biggest democracy\u00a0showed the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) winning at least 350 seats in parliament of the 542 that were up for grabs. The BJP alone was poised to take about 290 seats.\u00a0 A coalition of parties needs just 272 seats in the lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha (People's House) to form the new government and nominate the prime minister -- making it all but certain that Modi would find himself in that seat for another five years. \"Together we will build a strong and inclusive India,\" Modi proclaimed on Twitter as the results became clear. \"India wins yet again!\" \u0938\u092c\u0915\u093e \u0938\u093e\u0925 + \u0938\u092c\u0915\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0938 + \u0938\u092c\u0915\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938 = \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u0940 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924Together we grow. Together we prosper. Together we will build a strong and inclusive India.  India wins yet again! #VijayiBharat Modi's BJP broke its own record for an election performance this year, bettering the results from the last general elections in 2014, in which it won 282 seat. Their alliances added another 54 seats, taking the total NDA tally to 336. That, five years ago, was the best tally by any one party in three decades. BJP's main opposition party, the Indian National Congress (INC), had won just 54 seats, 10 better than the last election. But their performance in 2014 - winning 44 seats - was their worst ever. The party that has governed India for 49 of its 72 years of independence will now be forced to take a hard look at its campaign strategy.\u00a0 The results were not yet official as counting continued, but the final numbers were not expected to deviate significantly from the preliminary returns.\u00a0 In one of the biggest upsets of the elections, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, of the Indian National Congress party, lost his parliamentary seat in Uttar Pradesh state's Amethi district. Gandhi held onto another seat so will technically remain a member of the legislature, but the defeat in Amethi, which he had held for many years, was a huge embarrassment, and he acknowledged the sentiment across the country. \"Today, frankly, it doesn't matter what I think went wrong,\" Gandhi said. \"Today what matters is that the people of India have decided that Narendra Modi is going to be the Prime Minister.\" Modi met his cabinet colleagues and party leaders Thursday evening in New Delhi to discuss the formation of a new government. That process will likely take a few days as they jump through the hoops of officially nominating the prime minister and the council of ministers. It will all culminate in an oath-taking ceremony, expected before the end of May.\u00a0 During a bitter election campaign, the opposition targeted Modi on economic issues, like failure to create jobs when the unemployment rate is at its highest in four decades, a farm sector crisis, and an alleged hate campaign against minority Muslims. But none of those issues seemed to resonated with voters.  Modi's campaign focused sharply on nationalism and security, especially after recent heightened tensions with neighbor Pakistan. The two nuclear-armed Asian neighbors managed to step back from the brink of war after a major terror attack in Indian Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan-based militants and responded to with airstrikes inside Pakistan.\u00a0 Modi has been credited with strengthening India's foreign policy, and he often takes credit for \"isolating Pakistan\" on the world stage. With his handling of the Pakistan stand-off early this year, he carried the image of a strong leader into the election, and it paid off.  That could mean the world will see more strained ties between India and Pakistan during the next five years.\u00a0 \"Modi's resounding win gives India a strong new mandate to maintain its hard line on Pakistan,\" Michael Kugelman, Deputy Director of the Asia Program at the Washington D.C.-based Wilson Center, told CBS News on Thursday. \"When Modi first took office for his last term in 2014, he extended an olive branch to Islamabad. But circumstances have changed now, with emotions from the recent crisis with Pakistan still raw, and the new Modi government will not be in a conciliatory mood -- at least not initially,\" Kugelman said. Audrey Truschke, an assistant professor of South Asian history at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said there were many factors that brought Modi and his BJP their landslide victory, including a weak opposition and the national security concerns mentioned above, \"but the BJP ran on a platform of Hindutva; a bigoted ideology that proclaims Hindu supremacy and views India's religious minorities -- especially Muslims and Christians -- as second-class citizens.\" \"Hate carried the day,\" Truschke told CBS News. The BJP has been accused of running a religiously polarising campaign, amid a string of violent attacks on Muslims in the country, often in the name of protecting cows, which are sacred to Hindus. \u00a0 Modi taunted his political opponents in the Congress party, seen as being close to India's Muslim community, in his victory speech. \"A particular group used to wear the tag of secularism to get away with anything,\" he said. \"Now no one can dare cheat the country by wearing the niqab (Muslim headscarf worn by women) of secularism.\"",

Now it's your turn,\" the New York senator said, in response to a video of Mr. Trump's call for unity: \"In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy.\" KAMALA HARRIS:\u00a0In a live interview on CNN, the California senator called the president's remarks today \"empty and frankly meaningless,\" and said Mr. Trump isn't providing real leadership. She sharply criticized his decision to go golfing while \"babies are being orphaned.\"\u00a0 AMY KLOBUCHAR:\u00a0The Minnesota senator tweeted that Mr. Trump's statement was inadequate to address the situation at hand. She said, \"'Mental illness & hate pulls trigger, not the gun' is President's dodge to avoid truth: there's mental illness&hate throughout world, but U.S. stands alone w/high rate of gun violence. When someone can kill 9 people in a minute, that gun should never have been sold. Action!\" SETH MOULTON:\u00a0\"In other words, we must condemn you,\" was the congressman's reply in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0to a video of Trump saying \"In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy.\"\u00a0 TIM RYAN:\u00a0Ryan criticized the president for blaming video games and mental illness for the mass shootings.\u00a0He\u00a0tweeted, \"The President is scapegoating video games and mental health\u2014utterly disgraceful. @realDonaldTrump, tell Mitch McConnell to bring the Senate back from Recess and vote on the House-passed bills, HR 8 and HR 1112.\" BERNIE SANDERS:\u00a0The Vermont senator also called the president hypocritical for his remarks on the shootings. He\u00a0tweeted, \"Mr. President: It's not about what you say. It's about what you do. Stop your hatred, divisiveness\u00a0 and anti-immigrant rhetoric. If you truly want to be bipartisan, ask McConnell to call the Senate back into session and pass gun safety legislation that Americans are demanding.\" ELIZABETH WARREN:\u00a0The Massachusetts senator, like some of the other candidates, criticized Mr. Trump's statement that \"mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not guns.\" She\u00a0tweeted, \"White supremacy is not a mental illness. We need to call it what it is: Domestic terrorism. And we need to call out Donald Trump for amplifying these deadly ideologies.\"\u00a0 JOHN DELANEY:\u00a0In addition to expanding background checks and limiting assault weapons, Delaney would like to explore the use of liability insurance for firearms. He detailed the idea in response to a question from a caucus goer at a barbecue in Iowa on Monday.\u00a0 CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ellee Watson\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0note that this is a new idea from Delaney that wasn't included in in the gun safety plan he released in\u00a0June.\u00a0Delaney said, \"It seems to me that requiring liability insurance would be a pretty smart way of making sure that people who are actually law abiding citizens possess firearms.\" STATE-BY-STATE UP NORTH:\u00a0In the wake of mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton,\u00a0members of Beto O'Rourke's New Hampshire campaign\u00a0launched a #RefuseToDoNothing campaign, countering episodes of gun violence with attendance at a local Latino American Festival, rally to support New Hampshire gun safety legislation and call to donate blood to the American Red Cross.\u00a0 According to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga, campaign staffers on Tuesday will send care packages and letters to the victims' families in El Paso and Dayton. The campaign said that a number of its Granite State organizers come from Texas, including some from El Paso and its surrounding communities. REMATCH IN IOWA:\u00a0Former congressional candidate J.D. Scholten announced today that he will run again to try to unseat Rep. Steve King in Iowa's 4th Congressional District. Scholten lost to King by 3.3% in the November 2018 election, the closest a Democrat has come to beating the nine-term congressman.\u00a0 \"This time, we're going to get the job done,\" Scholten said in a statement announcing his candidacy. \u00a0Scholten, who was also considering a run for the Senate, ultimately decided he wanted to take another shot at representing the district where he grew up. \"This district is where my heart's at,\" Scholten told\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0in an interview Monday. \"We've got 55,000 farmers in this district who are all just struggling. They need a leader and a voice.\" Iowa's 4th District is normally safe territory for Republicans, and Scholten acknowledged \"it's going to be tough\" to get the final votes he needs to secure a victory in November 2020. Scholten said his goal is to connect with at least 70% of voters in the district by election day.\u00a0 King was stripped of his Congressional committee assignments earlier this year after an interview with The New York Times in which he suggested that white nationalism and white supremacy should not be considered offensive terms. There are currently three Republicans challenging King in the primary, and Scholten said his campaign will operate the same regardless of who he faces in the general election. \"When I was a pitcher, I didn't care what uniform was on the other team,\" Scholten said. \"I had a game plan and I was going to execute it. If you followed our race last time, I barely mentioned King at any of our town halls. I talked about what we're for. And that's what my campaign was all about last time and it's going to be this time too. It's about who we are fighting for and what we stand for.\" TX GOP RETIREMENTS: U.S. Representative\u00a0Kenny Marchant's decision\u00a0on Monday to forgo reelection in 2020 brings the count to nine U.S. House Representatives \u2014 including four from Texas \u2014 who have announced retirements from public office this year.\u00a0 It is another potential headache for House Republicans that could benefit Democrats, who now have three open seats in Texas that had single-digit GOP wins in 2018: Rep. Marchant's 24th Congressional District, Rep. Pete Olson's 21st Congressional District and Rep. Will Hurd's 23rd Congressional District. Republican Party of Texas Chairman James Dickey told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0they are \"grateful\" Marchant and others are making their announcements earlier, giving more time for GOP candidates to meet the state's December filing deadline.\u00a0 Staying in Texas, Justice Democrats-backed primary challenger Jessica Cisneros called out Democrat incumbent Rep. Henry Cuellar in Texas 28th Congressional District for having an \"A\" rating and accepting money from the NRA.\u00a0 In a statement following this weekend's mass shootings, Cisneros said, \"These tragedies will continue to happen if Congress keeps catering to the NRA and corporate firearm lobby's interests... Rep. Cuellar has an opportunity to put the interests of our communities before his sponsors, so I call on him to return the NRA's contributions and support common-sense gun reforms.\"",

            "article_content": "Trisulti, Italy -- A new school backed by Steve Bannon will give students tools to defend \"the Judeo-Christian West,\" he explained to CBS News as part of a wide-ranging interview. The school, which will eventually be based in an ancient monastery about an hour outside of Rome, will offer students, \"the kind of underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian West\u2026 what the values are, what we stand for, and also, in modern media, what we call a modern gladiator school,\" Bannon told CBS News' Seth Doane. Bannon, the chief strategist behind President Trump's successful 2016 election campaign, has since fallen out with Mr. Trump and much of the leadership of the Republican Party in the United States. He said the school in Italy, called the \"Academy for the Judaeo-Christian West,\" would be geared toward \"mid-career\" people \"looking to do something different.\" Benjamin Harnwell, a British former political operative and associate of Bannon, is in charge of the project. He currently lives -- along with one monk and a cook -- at the massive property called Trisulti that sits off a winding mountain road. Standing in what used to be the monastery's pharmacy, he told CBS News he plans to accept around 50 students and that Bannon will teach a class in media relations. In the Middle Ages, the monks at Trisulti cultivated around 2,500 types of plants for medicinal purposes. History books also credit them with inventing Sambuca. Harnwell would not give details of the curriculum, an opening date, nor an indication of who else, apart from Bannon, had been tapped to teach at the school, though he said he was expecting to launch at a separate, temporary location this year and at the monastery in 2020. \"My hope for Trisulti,\" Harnwell said, \"is that it will go from being a laboratory of herbs and herbal knowledge to becoming a laboratory of ideas.\" Benjamin Harnwell told CBS News that he worked his way up in U.K. politics until, eventually, he moved to Brussels to serve as chief of staff to a British member of the European Parliament (MEP). \"I was very strongly pro-European,\" he said, until he started working at the EU, when he came to believe that, as a body, it was self-serving. \"It's an organization that exists to serve the interests, first and foremost, for the people who work for it, rather than the needs of various peoples of the member states,\" Harnwell said. A staunch Catholic, he became increasingly skeptical of governmental power and interested in libertarianism. He eventually left Brussels and founded a think-tank in Rome called the Dignitatis Humanae Institute (DHI), the goal of which, according to the website, is to \"protect and promote human dignity based on the anthropological truth that man is born in the image and likeness of God\u2026 mainly by supporting Christians in public life.\" In 2014, Steve Bannon, also Catholic, delivered a speech via Skype at a conference organized by DHI at the Vatican, where he laid out his concerns with capitalism, the \"immense secularization of the West,\" and what he characterized as the West's \"outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism,\" according to a transcript of the speech published by Buzzfeed. Harnwell said the contents of Bannon's address formed the ideological foundation for the Academy for the Judaeo-Christian West, the aim of which will be to give students from around the world the academic background and political tools to return to their home countries and effect change. \"It's not a case of learning for learning's sake,\" Harnwell said. \"It's with the intention of having a specific application with the wider ambit of the culture wars.\" Bannon has spent months in Europe trying to recruit right-wing politicians across the continent to be a part of what Harnwell calls the Academy's \"sister concept,\" a Brussels-based group named The Movement.\u00a0 According to reports, his services have been welcomed by Marine le Pen in France, though initially she rejected them, and Matteo Salvini in Italy. Hungary's Victor Orban didn't openly say he was joining the group, but told Reuters that he \"wished a lot of success\" for the project. \"We are working in separate areas, separate corners, of the same battlefield,\" Harnwell said. A self-proclaimed \"united consortium,\" The Movement, \"supports parties and candidates across Europe that advocate for nationalist populism in their states and oppose encroachment on sovereignty by international forces, ahead of the European parliamentary elections in May,\" according to a press release. \"What I want to see is the little guy have a voice at the table,\" Bannon told CBS News. \"The future of politics today, whether the globalists like it or not, is going to be populism,\" he continued. The European Union is made up of three main bodies, one of which -- the European Parliament based in Brussels -- is directly elected by citizens every five years. A recent report by the European Council on Foreign Relations, a pro-EU think tank, said anti-EU parties could win more than a third of parliamentary seats in this year's votes. That number of seats would give these parties the power, if they coordinated their efforts, to effectively stall a significant amount of the body's operations. \"Their ability to paralyse decision-making at the centre of the EU would defuse pro-Europeans' argument that the project is imperfect but capable of reform,\" the report warned. Whether or not disparate nationalist parties would be able to, or want to, work together is its own question. \"I don't really see (Bannon) fitting into the cultural diversity which exists here,\" Dr. Ruth Wodak, Emeritus Distinguished Professor and chair in Discourse Studies at Lancaster University, who studies populism and the far-right in Europe, told CBS News. \"The different movements are quite different\" in various EU member countries.\u00a0 Bannon, she points out, has had limited success in courting Europe's right wing, with parties in some countries embracing him and his ideas, and others, like Austria's far-right Freedom Party, rejecting them. \"There's a lot of skepticism about\u2026 the Americans coming to Europe and wanting to teach Europeans something,\" she said. \"It's difficult to imagine somebody like him being a mastermind\u2026 for some of the European countries which have very different histories and have had fascist or Nazi pasts.\" \"I think economic nationalism, particularly when you look at these different countries, is what binds people together,\" Bannon told CBS News. \u00a0 There are also legal limits on what kind of work Bannon's European ventures can do.\u00a0 Britain's Guardian newspaper looked into election laws in the 13 countries in which Bannon has reportedly sought to operate and found that nine of them prohibit any significant financial contributions from foreign entities to political parties. For Harnwell, however, the objectives are more ideological than material. \"We're treating the West as a concept,\" he said, \"rather than a geographical entity. This is fundamentally a battle of ideas.\" Haley Ott is a digital reporter/producer for CBS News based in London.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 In closing arguments Wednesday, the prosecution portrayed former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone as a liar trying to protect himself and help then-candidate Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential race at any cost. \"Roger Stone does not get to pick and choose which facts he thinks are important and lie about the rest of them,\" said prosecutor Jonathan Kravis in the closing arguments of a trial that ended a week earlier than expected. \"Roger Stone sees a chance to help the Trump campaign, and he jumps at it.\"  Stone was\u00a0indicted\u00a0on seven charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction. He is accused of collaborating with\u00a0WikiLeaks\u00a0to release Democrats' emails that were hacked by Russia in order to damage Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump's 2016 opponent \u2014 and he is accused of lying about it. He is also charged with tampering with a witness, radio personality Randy Credico, pressing him not to cooperate with a congressional investigation that involved Stone.  When you have \"a witness who goes before a congressional committee and tell them to lie, that is witness tampering,\" said Kravis.  Prosecutors presented evidence throughout the trial that Stone tried to get information from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, specifically asking for details about the hacked emails that WikiLeaks published in order to influence the 2016 election.  But the defense team claimed Stone lacked corrupt intent in his words and actions and never actually had access to WikiLeaks.  \"I guess you can say Stone played the campaign, letting them believe that he had some connection\" to WikiLeaks, said defense attorney Bruce Rogow in his closing arguments.  Several high-profile witnesses were called to testify, including former deputy Trump campaign manager Rick Gates and\u00a0Steve Bannon, a former Trump campaign chief executive and White House senior counselor.\u00a0 \t Roger Stone himself, however, chose not to take the stand.\u00a0 \t Gates, who testified on Tuesday as part of a cooperation agreement with the government,\u00a0pleaded guilty last year to charges stemming from the\u00a0Mueller investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign's role in it. His testimony in a separate case helped to convict Paul Manafort, a former Trump campaign chairman, of conspiracy against the United States. \t On the stand for the prosecution, Bannon pointed to Stone as the apparent point of access between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks.\u00a0 According to Bannon, Stone is the only person affiliated with the Trump campaign who claimed to be in contact with WikiLeaks. In August 2016, Stone emailed Bannon to say that it was possible for Trump to win the election, and said, \"I know how to win, but ain't pretty.\" Under oath, Bannon said he interpreted this to mean that Stone was talking about campaign \"dirty tricks\" and \"opposition research.\"\u00a0 In his earlier grand jury testimony, Bannon had said, \"I think it was generally believed that the [Trump campaign's] access point [to Assange] would be Roger Stone.\"\u00a0 Stone's social media appears to foster that impression. On Sunday, October 2, 2016, Stone tweeted, \"Wednesday @Hillary Clinton is done. #Wikileaks.\" Two days later, on Tuesday, October 4, Assange said documents would subsequently be released every week and that some of the documents would be related to the presidential election. Three days after Stone's tweet, on October 7, WikiLeaks released the emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. (This happened soon after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape of Mr. Trump's vulgar language about grabbing women was published.)  When asked why he emailed Stone on October 4, 2016, Bannon replied, \"Because Roger was the guy who knew about WikiLeaks and knew Julian Assange.\"\u00a0  After WikiLeaks released Podesta's hacked emails in October, a Trump official messaged Stone to say, \"Well done.\" Stone's defense, however, points out that it's unknown what that was in reference to.\u00a0  \"Could have been that he went to a steakhouse and wanted a steak 'well-done,'\" said Rogow.  The prosecution outlined lies that Roger Stone allegedly told about his written communications, his conversations with Mr. Trump and his involvement with WikiLeaks.  Stone told a House Intelligence Committee that Credico was his only backchannel to Assange. Credico, however, testified that Stone bragged to him about having his own backchannel to Assange. Prosecutors believe it was another Stone associate, Jerome Corsi.\u00a0  Stone claimed he hadn't asked anyone to do anything for him regarding WikiLeaks. But emails showed Stone asked Corsi and Credico to pass along his request for more updates to Assange.  Stone's defense team argued that his actions lacked corrupt intent because Stone voluntarily testified before the House Intelligence Committee and urged jurors to consider his \"state of mind\" given that the scope of the congressional hearing was Russia \u2014 not Assange.   Furthermore, said Rogow, \"There could be no sensible motive in trying to protect the campaign when it was long since over, and Mr. Trump was the president of the United States.\" Stone allegedly threatened to harm both Credico \u2014 whom he was accused of using to communicate with Assange \u2014 and his dog if he didn't plead the fifth and refuse to testify in a congressional investigation.\u00a0  The jurors were shown texts from Stone telling Credico to \"Do your Frank Pentangeli\" in front of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. In the movie \"The Godfather Part II,\" Frank Pentangeli lies to Congress, pretending not to know anything incriminating about the Corleone family.\u00a0  Stone also texted Credico, \"I guarantee you are the only one who gets indicted for perjury if you're stupid enough to testify.\" The prosecution said this was evidence that Stone was trying to shield information from Congress.  \"Roger Stone is a political strategist,\" Kavis said to the jury. \"He knows how this is going to look [when] the committee was looking into the Russian interference\" in the 2016 election.  But the defense framed the story differently.  In his closing arguments, Rogow said, \"Stone and Credico for years have joked about the Godfather\" and \"this is nothing malignant.\"  Throughout his trial, several controversial people came to support Stone, including alt-right commentator\u00a0Milo Yiannopoulos\u00a0and\u00a0Gavin McInnes, founder of Proud Boys, an extremist group with ties to white nationalism.  On the first day of his trial \u2014 before he left early because he said he had food poisoning \u2014 a person outside of the courtroom yelled, \"You'll get to see Manafort soon,\" referring to the former Trump campaign chairman who was\u00a0sentenced by the judge in this trial\u00a0to more than six years in prison.  Stone, who has filed to have his charges acquitted, faces up to 20 years in prison. A verdict could come as soon as Thursday.  The conclusion of Stone's trial coincided with a new and more public phase of the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, who is accused of seeking a politically charged quid pro quo with the president of Ukraine and pressuring him to launch investigations that could benefit his reelection campaign.\u00a0  Clare Hymes contributed reporting.

            "article_content": "Facebook is banning misinformation about the 2020 Census and elections as it updates it policies to deal with online trolls and other bad actors.  In a report released over the weekend, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg detailed a number of steps it's taking to secure the 2020 elections. The company is banning ads that tell people not to vote and last year banned a range of \"misinformation\" on voting, including posts that misrepresent when, where or how to vote or threaten violence relating to voting or an election, it said.  The company also plans to introduce a \"census interference policy\" later this year, in the lead-up to the once-a-decade count of all U.S. residents. The policy will \"prohibit misrepresentations of census requirements, methods, or logistics, and census-related misinformation,\" the company said in its report. The report's lead author, former American Civil Liberties Union executive   Laura Murphy, was hired by Facebook in May 2018 to assess its   performance on vital social issues.  Facebook has been widely criticized for allowing trolling and misinformation on its sites in the lead-up to the 2016 elections, with various actors using the platform to target vulnerable populations, discourage voting and stir white nationalism. Federal officials have expressed concern that similar tactics could wreak havoc on the 2020 Census.\u00a0 The census ultimately determines the allocation of hundreds of billions in federal funding as well as the assignment of electoral districts. Certain groups of people \u2014 including black and Hispanic residents,  Native Americans on reservations, renters and poor people \u2014 have been under-counted in prior counts, while homeowners and white residents were overcounted. The Trump  administration's attempt to add a last-minute citizenship question to  the census, though it has been temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court, sets the stage for further confusion.\u00a0 Facebook will make a searchable database for jobs, loans and credit-card offers available for all U.S. users, the company said in its report. It's taking those actions as part of a March settlement with civil-rights groups that accused the company of encouraging discrimination in its targeted advertising.\u00a0 The groups had claimed Facebook violated anti-discrimination   laws by preventing audiences, like single mothers and the disabled,   from seeing many housing ads, or excluding women and older workers from job ads. The searchable housing ads database will roll out by the end of 2019,    Facebook said, and Murphy said she expects the employment and   financial service offerings databases to be available within the next   year. Murphy said she's \"very excited\" about the move and believes they could help boost the social mobility of millions of people in the United  States. Targeted ads tailored to individuals are Facebook's bread and butter \u2014   accounting for the vast majority of its more than $50 billion in annual   revenues last year. It's unlikely that making the ads searchable would   have a significant effect on Facebook's business. But analysts have   cautioned that any restrictions on Facebook's ability to   target ads could scare off advertisers.  Galen Sherwin, senior staff attorney at the ACLU and the group's lead  attorney in the case against Facebook, said making the three databases  searchable by anyone \"definitely creates greater access to information  about economic opportunities.\" However, civil rights groups are concerned that the secretive, proprietary  algorithms that govern how the company steers ads\u2014 even when not  consciously targeting specific groups \u2014 could still be discriminatory. \"I wish we could see into the black box,\" Sherwin said. Facebook still faces a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development complaint over the targeting and delivery of housing ads. Murphy,  the auditor, said she thinks the company understands it's \"going to have  to look at the algorithms\" behind them. The company also faces privacy and anti-trust investigations in the  U.S. and Europe over data-collection practices that critics call invasive and  struggles to police speech globally with sometimes lethal  repercussions. Facebook continues to walk a fine line in its attempts to shed \"harmful content,\" including hate speech and fascist speech. To be more effective, the company will dedicate some content moderators on hate speech alone. A few dozen are involved so  far, the company said in its Saturday report. All come from the more than 20,000 outsourced  content moderators who screen the platform. Two days after the report was released, ProPublica reported on a 9,500-member secret Facebook group for border control agents in which users joked about migrant deaths, discussed throwing burritos at Latino congress members and posted fake pornography of a congressional representative. The group has been in existence for three years, according to ProPublica. Recommendations from the Facebook audit include ending a carve-out for humor as an  exception in hate speech and devising better mechanisms for blocking  harassment, which can be especially overwhelming for targets when automated.",

            "article_content": "Facebook said it removed 3.2 billion fake accounts from its service from April to September, up slightly from 3 billion in the previous six months. Nearly all of the bogus accounts were caught before they had a chance to become \"active\" users of the social network, so they are not counted in the user figures the company reports regularly. Facebook estimates that about 5% of its 2.45 billion user accounts are fake. The company said in a report Wednesday that it also removed 18.5 million instances of child nudity and sexual exploitation from its main platform in the April-September period, up from 13 million in the previous six months. It said the increase was due to improvements in detection. In addition, Facebook said it removed 11.4 million instances of hate speech during the period, up from 7.5 million in the previous six months. The company said it is beginning to remove hate speech proactively, the way it does with some extremist content, child-exploitation and other material. Facebook expanded the data it shares on its removal of terrorist propaganda. Its earlier reports only included data on al-Qaida, ISIS and their affiliates. The latest report shows Facebook detects material posted by non-ISIS or al-Qaida extremist groups at a lower rate than those two organizations. The report is Facebook's fourth on standards enforcement and the first to include data from Instagram in areas such as child nudity, illicit firearm and drug sales, and terrorist propaganda. The company said it removed 1.3 million instances of child nudity and child sexual exploitation from Instagram during the reported period, much of it before people saw it. In addition to fighting fake accounts, Facebook has unveiled new safety and transparency protocols in order to better safeguard the U.S. election process and ensure the misinformation campaign that rocked the 2016 election is not repeated. Facebook was just one of the key players in the Russian effort to sow discord and dissension in the U.S. during the 2016 race. In the lead-up to the 2016 elections, Russian troll farms were allowed to troll and spread misinformation on Facebook's sites, with various actors using the platform to target vulnerable populations, discourage voting and stir white nationalism. The company received widespread criticism for not better preventing acts of foreign influence in the democratic process. According to testimony by top intelligence chiefs, U.S. officials believed the Kremlin sought to directly interfere in the U.S. election and pave the way for a Trump presidency, and one tactic of the multi-pronged attack was a wave of misinformation.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidates have in recent days called on China to respect Hong Kong's autonomy in contrast to President Trump, who on Tuesday called the situation \"tough\" and said, he hopes \"it works out for everyone, including China.\" In a tweet on trade talks on Wednesday, however, the president said China should \"work humanely\" with Hong Kong. CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ellee Watson\u00a0says the candidates have expressed support for Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters amidst reports that China is sending military vehicles to the border to monitor the demonstrations that have grown since they started in June. In Iowa, Juli\u00e1n Castro told reporters on Tuesday the U.S. \"needs to be marshaling as much support as we can with our allies to pressure China to respect individual freedom and expression and the arrangement that it has had with Hong Kong.\" South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at the Iowa State Fair said Hong Kong \"needs a strong voice from the U.S. calling for restraint on the part of authorities and speaking to the aspirations to the people in Hong Kong seeking freedom.\" Ahead of the second Democratic debates in July, the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations\u00a0asked the candidates how the situation in Hong Kong should affect broader U.S. policy toward China. The answers all include the need to defend human rights and work with allies to do so, which aligns with what voters want to hear, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0released by the progressive Center for American Progress in July. The protests come amid\u00a0a trade dispute between China and the United States that have resulted in tariffs on both countries. Mr. Trump also connected Hong Kong and the China trade negotiations in another tweet on Wednesday. The tweet focused on jobs and claimed that the U.S. \"is winning against China, although Hong Kong is not helping.\" The president's comments do not align with the approach his State Department is taking. A spokesperson told CBS News the U.S. is deeply concerned by reports of Chinese paramilitary movement on the Hong Kong border and is urging Beijing to adhere to its commitment to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS A federal \"Domestic Terrorism Prevention Order\" similar to a state \"red flag\" law is among one of the proposals Harris announced on Wednesday. The California senator released a new plan to counter violent white supremacy and domestic terrorism just over a week after authorities say a gunman in El Paso killed 22 people while targeting the Texas border city's Hispanic community.\u00a0 CBS News Campaign Reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0says Harris' plan calls for a federal \"red flag\" law, for the use of executive action as a way to make online gun sellers conduct background checks and for Congress to add the study of domestic terrorism to the National Counterterrorism Center's mission. Harris wants to allocate $2 billion over 10 years for the Department of Homeland Security to focus on domestic terrorism.\u00a0 SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN Warren asked the Federal Trade Commission's inspector general to open an investigation into the commission for allegedly misleading victims of the Equifax breach about how much compensation they'd get. \"Unfortunately, it appears as though the agency itself may have misled the American public about the terms of the Equifax settlement and their ability to obtain the full reimbursement to which they are entitled,\" Warren wrote in a\u00a0letter\u00a0to the acting inspector general Andrew Katsaros on Tuesday. CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says in mid-July, an FTC-Equifax\u00a0settlement\u00a0said victims could opt for \"alternative reimbursement compensation of up to\" $125. But by the end of the month, the FTC was\u00a0urging\u00a0victims to pick 10 years of free credit monitoring instead of the money as compensation because so many claims were filed that victims would get \"nowhere near the $125.\" Warren wrote to Katsaros, \"I ask that you conduct an investigation into the terms of and FTC's public description of the settlement with Equifax.\"\u00a0 CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0notes that Mr. Trump will travel to New Hampshire on Thursday for his first 2020 campaign stop in the state. The president lost New Hampshire in 2016 by fewer than 3,000 votes, or 0.4% of votes cast. The GOP hopes to flip the state next year, deploying its first field operation to the Granite State \u2013 including a New Hampshire data director and communications staff.\u00a0 Even as popular Republican Gov. Chris Sununu won reelection in last year's midterms, the state's legislature flipped blue, with Democrats overtaking both the House and Senate. Making matters worse for the GOP, the New Hampshire Democratic Party boasted $676,000 cash on hand during the second fundraising quarter of the year \u2014 more than 11 times that of their New Hampshire Republican Party counterparts.\u00a0 According to a University of New Hampshire poll released Tuesday, 42% of New Hampshire residents approve of Mr. Trump's performance as president, while 53% disapprove. That net approval rating remains virtually unchanged since the midterm elections. Andy Smith, the director of the UNH survey center, said winning the state would depend largely on turning out base voters rather than the relatively small pool of moderates who could swing either way.\u00a0 \"I think we're at a point where the parties are so polar opposite of one another. It's the Yankees and the Red Sox,\" he said. \"What happens in baseball is when you're team is not doing well? They tend not to show up at games.\"\u00a0 Republicans point to the state's booming economy as a cause for optimism. New Hampshire is currently home to the nation's fourth lowest rate of unemployment, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.\u00a0 In a joint statement, 22 Democratic presidential campaign state directors working on this year's New Hampshire primary condemned the president's upcoming visit: \"Donald Trump's presidency has been defined by broken promises, hateful rhetoric, and choosing to side with lobbyists and the top 1% at the expense of everyone else. This week, when he comes to New Hampshire we expect more of the same.\" Ahead of flurry of weekend visits to the Palmetto State by 2020 hopefuls, a recent Post and Courier Change Research\u00a0poll\u00a0shows former Vice President Joe Biden maintains a significant lead amongst the Democratic presidential contenders.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0notes that the poll surveyed 521 likely Democratic primary voters in the state and with 36%, Biden holds a 19-point advantage over Warren, who came in second with 17%.\u00a0 With planned visits at the end of the month by both Biden and Dr. Jill Biden, Biden's South Carolina team maintains that the poll results may speak to his appreciation for the state and that they're not taking anything or anyone for granted.\u00a0 \"We are a scrappy team that is going to fight for every last vote and we think South Carolina voters can see that,\" said South Carolina communications director Paige Hill. \"From what we've heard on the ground it means that voters know Joe Biden, they know his character and his values [and] he has a long history with South Carolina that includes not just campaigning but decades-long relationships ... Whether we are in the lead or not, our team is not taking anything or anyone for granted.\"\u00a0 While Biden and Warren continued to hold the No. 1 and 2 spots \u2014 as they did in the last Post and Courier poll in\u00a0June\u00a0\u2014 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders jumped to 3rd place (from 5th) with 16%. Sanders' South Carolina communications director Michael Wukela says the senator's bump is demonstrative of the work their team is putting in on the ground with tours across the Low country, phone banking, and canvassing.\u00a0 \"There's a difference between saying you're going to spend a whole lot of money on advertising versus going out and talking to voters where they are,\" said Wukela. \"We're meeting voters where they are and talking about the issues that really matter to them [and] that's really working.\"\u00a0 The poll also highlighted that Sanders was the second choice amongst voters ages 18 to 34. Tyler Radenbaugh is a 20-year old student at Florida Atlantic University and a committed Sanders supporter. He's registered to vote in South Carolina and he says that young people and voters in general are looking for the candidate that speaks to their needs.\u00a0 \"Bernie has been fighting for policies that help average people his entire life and there is no one with a better record of challenging power and standing with working people than him,\" said Radenbaugh. \"South Carolina voters are starting to take notice of his legacy.\"\u00a0 Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King is facing criticism from Democrats and fellow Republicans over comments he made while defending his belief that there should be no abortion exemptions for rape and incest.\u00a0 \"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?\" King said in Urbandale, Iowa on Wednesday, according to the\u00a0Des Moines Register. \"Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't say that I was not a part of a product of that.\"\u00a0 CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says 2020 presidential candidates quickly denounced King's comments, including Buttigieg, who is campaigning in southeast Iowa.\u00a0 \"You would think it would be pretty easy to come out against rape and incest. Then again you would think it'd be pretty easy to come out against white nationalism,\" Buttigieg said. He went on to say that he believes the Democrat running in the state's 4th Congressional District, J.D. Scholten, would be \"an excellent public servant.\"\u00a0 Other 2020 candidates including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand called on King to resign. Booker, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney posted on Twitter to encourage supporters to donate to Scholten.\u00a0 \"Yet again, Steve King puts his selfish, hateful ideology above the needs of the people of Iowa's 4th district. Excusing violence \u2014 in any way \u2014 is entirely unacceptable,\" Scholten said in a statement responding to King. \"His comments are disrespectful to survivors and don't reflect Iowan values. We stand for bringing all people together and fighting for the positive change that we desperately need here in Iowa.\"\u00a0 Republican State Sen. Randy Feenstra, who is challenging King in the primary, posted on\u00a0Twitter: \"I am 100% pro-life but Steve King's bizarre comments and behavior diminish our message & damage our cause. Trump needs defenders in Congress, not distractions. I will ensure we win this seat & I'll be an effective conservative leader in Congress.\"\u00a0 King's comments also drew criticism from his colleagues on Capitol Hill. \"These comments are wrong, and offensive, and underscore why we removed him from his committees,\" said Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the number two ranking House Republican. Earlier today, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris weighed in on Twitter concerning\u00a0reports\u00a0that South Carolina GOP lawmakers are \"fast-tracking\" an abortion ban through a state senate subcommittee before the state's General Assembly meets in January.\u00a0 \"It's outrageous South Carolina Republicans are covertly fast-tracking a dangerous bill to ban abortions before most women even know they're pregnant,\" said Harris in a\u00a0tweet. \"This is why I'll require states with a history of violating Roe v. Wade to pre-clear any abortion law before it takes effect.\"\u00a0 The hearing, which\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0says is scheduled to take place before the state senate's Medical Affairs subcommittee on Sept. 10, would feature hours of testimony concerning a measure that would ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected. Earlier this year, the South Carolina House\u00a0passed\u00a0a heartbeat bill, which bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected except in the cases of certain medical emergencies.\u00a0 As previously\u00a0reported by CBS News, \"heartbeat\" bans passed in various states are tied up in the hands of courts across the country. According to\u00a0research\u00a0compiled by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, there were 4,646 abortions performed in the state in 2018.\u00a0 Holly Gatling, the executive director of South Carolina Citizens for Life, says the non-profit is pleased that state senators are holding the scheduled hearings and hopes that the lawmakers will uphold the work of the state House.\u00a0 \"It's about restoring legal protection to the unborn and expanding protection to the medically vulnerable members of our human family,\" said Gatling. \"We live in a disposable society where they throw everything away\u2026and the weakest members of our society \u2014the unborn and the medically vulnerable \u2014 are the most targeted groups.\"\u00a0 On the other side of this fight, Planned Parenthood maintains that states with more abortion restrictions tend to have poorer health outcomes for women and children. Vicki Ringer, the South Carolina public affairs director for Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic, said in a statement that this latest effort by South Carolina politicians is an egregious attempt to ban abortion in the state and that the bill could take away a woman's right to make a medical choice before knowing she has a decision to make.\u00a0 \"Calling a special session to specifically ban abortion in our state just demonstrates how extreme and out-of-touch the lawmakers pushing this ban are ... never before have politicians in SC called for a committee meeting outside of legislative session just to attack abortion rights,\" said Ringer. \"Abortion is a critical component not only of women's health care but of their ability to lead free and fulfilling lives with dignity and autonomy.\"\u00a0 When asked whether the topic of abortion should continue to be at the forefront of the 2020 presidential campaign, Gatling added that this conversation is the single most important issue in our country today. \"Without the right to life there are no other rights.\" California Rep. Duncan Hunter's trial for corruption charges has been moved from Sept. 10 to Jan. 14, 2019, less than two months before California's Super Tuesday primary on March 3. Hunter has already filed with the FEC for reelection in 2020, but five other Republican challengers are lined up, in addition to Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar who lost to Hunter by three points in 2018. The corruption charges stem from Hunter and his wife's spending of $250,000 in campaign funds for personal use, which Hunter was indicted for a couple months before his 2018 election.\u00a0 Chairman of San Diego County's Republican Party Tony Krvaric told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0it won't endorse anybody until October 14. \"It will take a two-thirds vote of committee members to endorse one candidate over another,\" he said. \"We still don't know who all the candidates will be but I believe by then we will.\" Mississippi state Sen. Robert Foster endorsed his former gubernatorial opponent Bill Waller Jr. on Tuesday, less than two weeks away from the GOP gubernatorial runoff. Foster played a significant role in the initial primaries by capturing 17.8% of the vote, enough to keep Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves one point shy of winning the GOP nomination outright.\u00a0 Foster and Waller have similar stances on Medicare expansion and a state gas tax, though it is unsure if Waller, a former Mississippi Supreme Court chief justice, has all of Foster's voters behind him. In the two counties Foster won, Reeves had at least a 25-point advantage over Waller and a GOP strategist told\u00a0Navarro\u00a0endorsements that aren't from Mr. Trump himself haven't historically had a huge impact.\u00a0 \"I think it serves a purpose in that it can be an indicator of momentum for Waller, but at the end of day I wouldn't put all my eggs in one basket,\" the strategist said.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas that aired Sunday, August 4, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to Texas Republican Congressman Will Hurd, who announced this week that he would not run for re-election in 2020. He's the eighth House Republican this year to announce they're leaving elected office and he joins us this morning from San Antonio. Congressman Hurd, good morning. I know you know El Paso well. Your district is right adjoining to it. I think you have some familiarity with this WalMart where this massacre occurred. A couple of questions: what have you heard from there? Are you going to El Paso to join the vigil tonight and catch up with your former member of Congress, road trip mate, Beto O'Rourke? REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: Well- well first off, thanks for your coverage of- of this tragedy and for any of your- you folks watching this- this broadcast, if you live in Texas, if you live in Ohio, if you live in New Mexico, go donate blood. You can get on the Red Cross website to figure out how to do this. These communities need blood. They're going to need it for the next couple of days and the next couple of weeks. And- and also if you see something on social media of someone talking about doing a heinous crime like this, take a screenshot of it and share it with local law enforcement or the FBI's website. We can all be vigilant to seeing this kind of hate and this kind of rhetoric and make sure law enforcement has the tools they need- or- or the information in order to do something about it. But El- El Paso is- is a resilient community. You have a number of families that are still praying and- and worried because their loved one is not out of the- out of the proverbial woods yet, that are still in critical condition. You know, the- the- the youngest person that is injured was two-years-old. Her- his- the baby's mother was- was killed- was- she was only 25 years old. You know, you have people that are in their 80s that are going through- that are still in- in hospitals as well. And so this is a- this is a trying time not just for El Paso but- but the rest of the country. MAJOR GARRETT: Is this a national moment where the federal legislature should be involved? Do you expect anything to happen over this August recess or do you expect just five weeks of silence from Washington?\u00a0 REP. HURD: Well the- the- the House Representatives have passed a background piece of legislation. I was actually one of eight Republicans that joined in that. We should be preventing from putting guns in the hands of people that shouldn't have them. That's pretty straightforward and simple. But there's other things that we should be- be looking at as well. Why does a young man from the suburbs think this is the way that he should do something? That is a trend that we've seen so- so many times. I've learned in- in working with local law enforcement and federal law enforcement over the last couple of days on this issue, that federal law enforcement is prevented from searching social media websites, the public facing stuff about particular threats. That's something that you don't need legislation to- to fix. When look at, you know, the- the sequence of this attack in El Paso and- and eventually in- in Ohio, is there information sharing that could be improved between the federal government and local law enforcement? Does private security in these facilities have the training to do a suspicious activity reports? That they are doing suspicious activity reports? Where does that inform- information go? How are these folks ultimately getting radicalized? The FBI is going-- MAJOR GARRETT: Congressman. REP. HURD: --to do their review. Law enforcement is going to do their review. This is an act of terrorism and terrorism is an act where you use violence against civilians for a political end. And initial indications suggest that this is- this is based on- on race and- and hatred which would be white nationalist terrorism. Why are people being- being radicalized? You can go back, this-- MAJOR GARRETT: Congressman. REP. HURD: --this shooter is in custody. We're going to be able to learn a lot from him. MAJOR GARRETT: Right. REP. HURD: There was the shooting in Charleston a- A number of years ago that- that killer learned- he was doing web searches on Trayvon Martin and went down the rabbit hole of- of- of white nationalism and racism and was self-radicalized. These are some of the issues that we're going to have to- to review and it's- and yes Congress has a role. So does civil society. So does the media. This is an opportunity for us to focus on what unites us, not what's divides us. MAJOR GARRETT: Congressman, what role does President Trump in play- play in this? You heard your former colleague, Beto O'Rourke say \"he invites and tolerates racism.\"\u00a0 REP. HURD: I- I- I think divisive rhetoric is- is not the way to go. I think he's denounce these-\u00a0 these attacks. He has an opportunity to be the uniter-in-chief and I hope that's t- the way to go. But we can't just focus on just one person or just one entity. This is a problem that has many sources and we need to be talking about all those sources and ways that every element of society can work on- on dealing with this challenge. MAJOR GARRETT: Your land commissioner, George P. Bush, called this white terrorism and says it presents a real and ongoing threat in this country. Do you agree? REP. HURD: I- I- I agree and I- I would leave the- the analysis of this- this current activity and- and this current shooting in El Paso to the FBI. I know they are evaluating it and believing it is- is possibly a hate crime and fueled by this initial indications of this manifesto that the shooter- shooter wrote suggests that. And if it is- in that is indeed confirmed then yes this is- this is white nationalism terrorism and this is something that we're seeing. And again, I mentioned Charleston as a perfect example. I think we don't know enough about what happened in- in Ohio to suggest that that may be something similar. But I know law and local law enforcement and federal law enforcement is going to be turning over every rock and- and pursuing every lead. But again I- I think the thing that I've learned in- in my time representing a very diverse district, 71 percent Latino, a fifty-fifty district, is that way more unites us than divides us--\u00a0 MAJOR GARRETT: Right. REP. HURD: --and when we focus on those things that unite us. We're going to be better off. MAJOR GARRETT: Congressman we want to continue this conversation. That's why we're not going to let you go. Please stay right there. We just need to take a quick break, but we'll be right back with Congressman Will Hurd. COMMERCIAL BREAK MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation, and more with Texas Republican Will Hurd. So congressman, you ran in 2018- as you said it's a very competitive district- you won. Hillary Clinton carried your district in 2016. Why not run in 2020? Are you afraid of the effect that President Trump will have on those prospects? REP. HURD: No I- I- I'm interested in- in helping other candidates like me. I- I think- I want to see a- a Republican Party that has more folks that- that look and- and sound and operate like I do. I think it's an opportunity for me to help, you know, phenomenal candidates like Wesley Hunt down in Houston, Texas. He cares about his country, served his country in the military, has a-- MAJOR GARRETT: But-- REP. HURD: --beautiful young family, worked in- in the- the private sector-- MAJOR GARRETT: But- but congressman-- REP. HURD: and wants to continue to serve, so- so-\u00a0 MAJOR GARRETT: Congressman, you know-- REP. HURD: Yes, sir? MAJOR GARRETT: You know the way to do that is to stay, to raise money, to campaign alongside and say, \"He's joining me,\" not, \"I'm leaving and he needs to replace me.\" REP. HURD: Well what- what I find interesting and a lot of people have asked me that question, is that everybody thinks the end all or be all is actually being in Congress. The party is defined by the people that are in it, not necessarily the politicians. And so this gives me the freedom and flexibility to operate in other parts of the country. I'm also going to stay involved in that nexus of technology and law enforcement. You can do that outside of the-the halls of Congress. When you look at issues like artificial intelligence- and artificial intelligence is important because whoever matches it is going to rule the world. And the- the most interesting things that's happening in- in that area is outside of- of the federal government. So, I'm looking forward to- to continuing to serve my country. I left a job as an undercover officer in the CIA, a job I loved. I got to be the guy in the back alleys at four o'clock in the morning collecting on intelligence on threats to our homeland. I left that job in order to help the- the- the national security community in a different way by bringing my skills to Congress. And I'm going to be leaving the halls of Congress to help, you know, our country in a different way as well-- MAJOR GARRETT: Before it-- REP. HURD: --so I'm- I'm excited about the- the next couple of months because we still have a lot of work to do-- MAJOR GARRETT: Congressman Hurd. REP. HURD: --in Congress but I'm also looking forward to building a Republican Party of the future. MAJOR GARRETT: Before I let you go, John Ratcliffe, a colleague of yours, was for a very brief period of time, suggested by the president to be the new leader of the Director of National Intelligence, he's now pulled out. How concerned were you about that potential nomination itself and how concerned are you about the general state of the intelligence community without a leader and with the president and the White House appearing undeci- indecisive about how to replace outgoing DNI Dan Coats? REP. HURD: Well John Ratcliffe is- is my friend. John Ratcliffe is someone that I've been able to talk to as our- in our time on- on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He is ab- ability to- to digest vast amounts of- of information which is a skill set that's needed within the DNI. And- and I'm sorry that this thing turned out the way it did. I think Sue Gordon as an acting director of National Intelligence is an excellent choice. I've had the opportunity to work with her in the different roles she has played in- in national security. But this position of- of Director of National Intelligence has a lot of challenges. The existential threat that China is playing to us, you know, dealing with disinformation and how the Russians were trying to influence our elections. And of course, continuing to deal with terrorism overseas--\u00a0 MAJOR GARRETT: Right REP. HURD: --and abroad. MAJOR GARRETT: Congressman Hurd, thank you very much and thank you for staying for that extra segment. I want to let our audience know that law enforcement sources tell CBS News the Dayton shooter has been identified as Connor Betts, twenty-four-year-old from Bellbrook, Ohio. Police are searching his home presently. Thank you for being with us Congressman Hurd, as I said, we'll be right back with South Carolina Republican Senator, Tim Scott.",

I'm Margaret Brennan in the nation's capital. And this is FACE THE NATION. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Raise your right hand. I will begin by swearing you in. MARGARET BRENNAN: A whirlwind week of congressional hearings concludes and both sides dig in for even more political fireworks, as debate begins on whether or not to proceed with the vote on articles of impeachment. But what will those articles be if they do? And what's the President's defense? We'll map out what's ahead with counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway and the number two Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. We'll also hear from a Republican on the committee that will write those articles, North Dakota's Kelly Armstrong. (Excerpt from campaign ad) MARGARET BRENNAN: Plus, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg spends at least thirty-four million dollars on ads in more than two dozen states to announce he's joining the race. (Excerpt from campaign ad) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with our panel of legal experts, then look at the highs and lows in politics. And the rest of the news this week just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We have a lot to get to today, but we will begin with some breaking news. Michael Bloomberg is officially joining the presidential race. Our Ed O'Keefe is at the Washington bureau. Ed, the slogan, according to the website, is \"Rebuild America.\" What do you think the entry of this billionaire entrepreneur into the race will be? ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Well, for one thing it pumps a lot more money into this race. The fact that he's going to spend at least thirty-four million dollars across dozens of states to run an ad over the next week or so to introduce himself, not in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, but in places like Florida, New York, Illinois, several southern states, as well, because he's going to take aim instead of those early states at the Super Tuesday states that vote in early March, believing that he has no chance at this point to build a formidable operation in those early areas and instead wants to sell himself basically to the rest of the country. And he'll be essentially waiting out whoever emerges from those first four states, at least that's his hope, and will be able to confront them come Super Tuesday. But he enters the race as a moderate, as someone who is concerned about the direction of the Democratic Party and certainly the direction of the country, and he's making good on something, Margaret, as you and I know very well, that he's thought about doing since at least 2008. MARGARET BRENNAN: And this time he's-- he's pulling the trigger and getting in. We've seen the ad. We know that Senators Warren and Senator Sanders have been very harshly critical of Bloomberg's wealth and sort of characterized him as buying his way into a race without a grassroots movement. And it struck me watching his ad, this particular line, it seemed to be a nod to them. MAN (Campaign ad): The wealthy will pay more in taxes and the middle class get their fair share. Everyone without health insurance can get it and everyone who likes theirs keep it. ED O'KEEFE: That's right. It absolutely did. And-- and, you know, they see him as a convenient foil for their ongoing push against the wealthy and big corporations in this country. You know, Tom Steyer, the philanthropist who has been in this race but hasn't really made much of an impact. Bloomberg will immediately draw far more attention. And in that ad you noticed he says that he would support health care if you like what you have right now or essentially provide a public option. That puts him to the right of Warren and Sanders, probably more in line with Joe Biden, believing that instead of ripping up the Affordable Care Act it should be built out. So he will continue to make this sort of centrist push, believing that what-- what Sanders and Warren are suggesting is not good for the country and certainly not good for the Democratic Party in the short term, and-- and we'll see sort of how Sanders and Warren use his entry now as a potential argument for their candidacy instead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. And you mentioned at the top sort of the-- the different strategy of this campaign, and political junkies know the whole sort of model of the early caucus states, et cetera, but what is unique about this? I mean, is Bloomberg essentially buying his way in as he's being accused but in a way that is perhaps more effective, more sort of Trumpian? ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. That-- that will be the argument that some Democrats make for sure. He is-- he is buying his way in, in this sense, in that he is immediately getting himself on the air, building on a pretty significant operation because he can afford to do it. He's worth about fifty-two billion dollars. And it sounds like he's putting up at least a hundred fifty million at the start. Hundred fifty million at the start. What will be interesting about this, voters will tell us pretty quickly whether they can tolerate having somebody like this in the race or whether they are intrigued by it. One in five Democrats in our recent Battleground Tracker poll said they would take a look at him as a possible candidate and a third said they don't know enough about him. So this advertising campaign very quickly could help fill out his story a little bit. But what it will do more than anything, Margaret, for those of us who follow this and I think are intrigued by this late entry is load test the theory that you can bypass those first four states and still be competitive. Rudy Giuliani has tried this in the past. Other Democrats got in late, thinking that it would work for them, but they didn't have the resources. Bloomberg does. And he also has some goodwill with Democrats. Remember, this is somebody who has pushed strongly for gun control-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ED O'KEEFE:\u00a0 --in this country, who has helped bankroll big Democratic campaigns in big states and for congressional candidates across the country. Likely going to make an impact very early on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely. Ed O'Keefe, we'll be tracking just what that impact is. No doubt. And we turn now to impeachment. After thirty hours of televised testimony and with more than thirty-nine hundred pages of depositions released publicly so far, the question resonating through Washington and beyond is: what's next in the impeachment proceedings against President Trump? We begin today with a look at what we learned last week. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: First, the case against Mister Trump. Republican fundraiser-turned-ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland was the most anticipated witness. He told Congress that the President instructed him to work with Rudy Giuliani to convince Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. GORDON SONDLAND (Wednesday): Mister Giuliani's requests were a quid quo pro for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky. Was there a quid quo pro? The answer is yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President saw this part of Sondland's testimony as vindication-- REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (Wednesday): The quid quo pro you were discussing was over the aid, correct? GORDON SONDLAND: No. President Trump, when I asked him the open-ended question, what do you want from Ukraine? His answer was I want nothing. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and quoted from the hearing to declare the inquiry over. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Wednesday): Ready? Do you have the cameras rolling? I want nothing. That's what I want from Ukraine. That's what I said. I want nothing. I said it twice. MARGARET BRENNAN: Other witnesses, including former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill said they were alarmed when they learned of Sondland's efforts. FIONA HILL (Thursday): Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand and we were being involved in national security and foreign policy, and those two things had just diverged. I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up. And here we are. MARGARET BRENNAN: State Department aide David Holmes recounted Sondland's phone call with the President in a Ukrainian restaurant. DANIEL GOLDMAN (Thursday): So you heard President Trump ask Ambassador Sondland, is he going to do the investigation? DAVID HOLMES (Thursday): Yes, Sir. DANIEL GOLDMAN: What was Ambassador Sondland's response? DAVID HOLMES: He said, oh, yeah, he is going to do it. He will do anything you ask. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Hill also stressed that the President's continued suggestion that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for the 2016 leak of e-mails that embarrassed the Clinton campaign was dangerously wrong. FIONA HILL: This is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. DANIEL GOLDMAN: Is it your understanding then that President Trump disregarded the advice of his senior officials about this theory and instead listened to Rudy Giuliani's views? FIONA HILL: That appears to be the case, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Conclusions from each side predictably fell along partisan lines. Republicans said Democrats failed to make a compelling case against the President. REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD (Thursday): An impeachable offense should be compelling, overwhelmingly clear, and unambiguous. I have not heard evidence proving the President committed bribery or extortion. MARGARET BRENNAN: Democrats saw it differently. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (Thursday): And in my view, there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes they are above the law. And I would just say to people watching here at home and around the world, in the words of my great colleague, \"We are better than that.\" Adjourned. (End VT) (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back. Thank you for sticking with us through a technical problem there. We're joined now with counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway. Good morning to you, Kellyanne. KELLYANNE CONWAY (Counselor to the President/@KellyannePolls): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We right off the top talked about Michael Bloomberg getting into this race. What do you think the seventy-seven-year-old billionaire joining means for the field? KELLYANNE CONWAY: It means that the Democratic field is underwhelming, even to someone like Michael Bloomberg. There are eighteen Democrats still running for President of the United States, Margaret, with probably another ten or twelve already dropped out of the race. And as Michael Bloomberg coming in saying, I don't think any of you can beat Donald Trump, for all the talk about electability, that's a fiction. You don't know if somebody can or can't win until they do or don't. The-- the real way that you win is through the Electoral College, which we proved in 2016. So I think Bloomberg's play here is to ignore those early states and focus on Super Tuesday. That was supposed to be a play for someone like Kamala Harris to go in and really make big gains in California. She's all-- her candidacy is all but deflated. But I will say a couple of things about Michael Bloomberg. His-- his new ad that he'll put millions behind is all unicorns and rainbows. Keep your health care if you like to and if you don't, I've got something better for you. Let's rebuild America. Number one, we heard that from Obama-Biden and Obama-Biden care passed almost ten years ago and as we sit here today, over twenty-eight million Americans have no health insurance of any kind. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're happy to run against another New York billionaire? KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, we're ready. And how's that? I think that President Trump will be ready. The other thing is that Michael Bloomberg is saying rebuild America. America already elected a builder. If we want to truly rebuild America, then the people who work behind us for you and me ought to get infrastructure done. Surface transportation and air traffic control system that was built for one hundred thousand annual passengers who now have close to a billion. So we have a builder in the White House who wants them to do what Nancy Pelosi said she'd do this fall, it's almost Christmas, which is pass that USMCA which would be more jobs like he's talking. Look, Michael Bloomberg was a great mayor of New York City. I lived there under Rudy Giuliani and-- and Michael Bloomberg. All four of my kids were born in New York when Michael Bloomberg was mayor. I wish he'd be mayor of New York City again. But if he's going to jump-- if he's going to jump in-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. KELLYANNE CONWAY: --I think the most important thing to note is not just does the country have an appetite for a billionaire who's going to throw that money around the way-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. KELLYANNE CONWAY: --billionaire Trump never did. We were under-resourced and understaffed at the Trump campaign and we-- and Hillary Clinton's campaign showed the fastest way to make a small fortune is to have a very large one and waste most of it. It's not that Michael Bloomberg may not be unwelcomed by the national electorate, is he welcome in his own Democratic Party? You've got the frontrunners saying that we don't want any billionaires in the country, let alone in the Democratic primary. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to get on to what is happening here in Washington with this week of hearings. The President has said he wants a trial in the Senate, but then others at the White House say they're not even sure Democrats will move ahead with impeachment. What exactly are you preparing for? KELLYANNE CONWAY: We're preparing for both eventualities. And here's why, Margaret. If we-- if it does go to a trial in the Senate, and that is not certain right now. You've got a lot of Democrats wringing their hands that they did not see, as Will Hurd--a moderate Democrat, excuse me, a moderate Republican who's retiring this year said he did not see overwhelming, compelling, clear, and convincing evidence. Many of those Democrats, especially the ones who represent the thirty-one Trump-Pence districts from sixteen, they have to go back home and say, I know I promised to lower your drug prices. I know I promised to keep this great economy going on. I know I promised trade deals like USMCA, but we're busy impeaching a President. And they're getting blowback for that. So I think for those Democrats, they're-- it's not completely certain yet. Some of them have actually gone on the record saying, I'm not there yet. I have to see what the articles say-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. KELLYANNE CONWAY: --and what the report is. But we know what they didn't see this-- over twelve witnesses in two weeks of testimony and over thirty hours. They didn't hear anybody say when they were asked bribery? No. Extortion? No. Quid pro quo for the aid? No. Preconditions for a meeting? Did the President commit a crime? No, no, no every time. The closest they got to it was Sondland in his prepared remarks-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. KELLYANNE CONWAY: --saying he thought there was a quid pro quo for a meeting. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. KELLYANNE CONWAY: They had the meeting on September 22nd in-- in-- in New York. And also the aide went to Ukraine earlier than that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. KELLYANNE CONWAY: So they got their aid. They have got javelins and cyber rifles. The Ukrainian policy under President Trump is better than it was previously and Ukraine has more aid. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Sondland, you mentioned there who testified he-- he laid out a few different things there. But I'm wondering, you know, he serves at the pleasure of the President. Is he going to keep his job despite testifying against him? KELLYANNE CONWAY: He flew right back to Brussels, Belgium. I don't know that he testified against the President. Again, I need to remind the viewers that when Sondland was-- when Ambassador Sondland was asked by Adam Schiff, who I guess was waiting for a different response, so the quid pro quo was for the aid? And Sondland said, no, the quid pro quo was for a meeting or a statement. Ambassador Volker separately testified they abandoned the whole idea of making a statement to focus on the aid. That was very smart because Ukraine got its aid. Margaret, we simply can't impeach and remove a democratically elected president from office because you didn't beat him and they didn't beat him in 2016. They haven't a clue how to beat him in 2020. They don't much like him. And I think that in the-- if there is a Senate trial, we'll be able to-- that will be more familiar to most Americans. This process is unfamiliar to them, where the President-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning there will be witnesses? KELLYANNE CONWAY: --can't even have-- there'll be witnesses. The President couldn't even have his own attorneys in there. And that's-- that's not very fair to the, quote, defendant. But I think defense will go on offense if there is a Senate trial and they'll be-- we'll be able to call witnesses, we'll be able to challenge their witnesses-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. KELLYANNE CONWAY: --produce other evidence. And those witnesses may include the whistleblower, and I would say his attorney, because his attorney, Mark Zaid, had an e-mail or a text-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. KELLYANNE CONWAY: --ten days after inauguration saying the coup begins now, impeachment. MARGARET BRENNAN: The whistleblower's attorney there. Well, I want to get to something that we talked about in the top of the show. The President gave an extended interview on Fox on Friday, and he said once again that they, meaning Ukraine, have the server from the Democratic National Committee. Fiona Hill, the Russia expert formerly of the Trump White House, said this is something that's propagated by Russian security services-- services. It's false narrative. 60 MINUTES is going to have a report tonight on election hacking in 2016 and Bill Whitaker spoke to the man in charge of the DOJ investigation. Take a listen. BILL WHITAKER (60 MINUTES): Frankly, I think the public is kind of confused because we hear you one arm of the government saying it's the Russians. We hear another part of the government saying maybe the Russians, maybe somebody else. We don't know. So what are we to believe? Is it the Russians? Is it not? JOHN DEMERS (60 MINUTES): Well, our indictment spells out what it is. The evidence that we have has shown, which is it was the Russians who were behind the hacking and dumping of the Democratic campaign in 2016. BILL WHITAKER: No doubt? JOHN DEMERS: We could prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why doesn't the President believe his own Justice Department and intelligence experts? KELLYANNE CONWAY: But the President has said he accepts that. But also, there are plenty of ways to interfere in election. And respectfully, if we're doing this we're back to Mueller-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But he was specifically talking about the DNC server. KELLYANNE CONWAY: But if we're doing this, we're back to Mueller and we've already spent two and a half years and thirty-five million taxpayer dollars for a Mueller report that was produced in March. It was a big bomb. Mueller testimony in July, a bigger bomb. And if we're going to go back to that I think it exposes what didn't happen on Capitol Hill this week that high crimes and misdemeanors-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know that Crowdstrike, that firm that the President keeps bringing up is based here in the United States. It's a publicly traded firm. It's, in fact, been hired by Republicans-- KELLYANNE CONWAY: So, here-- here's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --since that time. KELLYANNE CONWAY: But here's what I want to say. And-- and I'm glad you mentioned this, because the July 25th call, Margaret, the transcript which the whole world has had access to, the President clearly lays out what's on his mind. As the day after Mueller testifies-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. KELLYANNE CONWAY: --and then the President looks at it it's his turn. He wants to get to the bottom of what happened in 2016 and certainly to avoid that in future. Look, we have done a great deal in our White House, across our administration, to secure our elections-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JOHN DEMERS: --in the future. And we agree with that. But I also don't want-- I don't want the impeachment process. I don't want members of the mainstream media-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. KELLYANNE CONWAY: --which don't include you, to interfere in the 2020 election the way they tried in the 2016 election. She's going to win. He has zero percent chance of winning. That's a different kind of interference, and that's dangerous, too. Speaking of the polls, very quickly, the independents have totally changed. A month ago, just in late October, they were in favor by fifteen points, including the national polls of impeaching the President. It now has flipped. Forty-nine percent against-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JOHN DEMERS: --thirty-four percent for. So, these Democrats who are in charge of the hearings don't represent the swing districts. They have to look at the polls and say there's no appetite to impeach and remove this President. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we're going to talk to one of those Democrats who is on the House Intelligence Committee ahead. But we're going to first take a break. Don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Jim Himes. He joins us from his district in Stamford, Connecticut. Good morning to you. Congressman, you-- you heard the White House case as laid out by Kellyanne Conway. Is there a chance that the House actually doesn't move ahead with impeachment? REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut/@jahimes/Intelligence Committee): Yeah. Case is an interesting way to put what Kellyanne Conway just did. I was keeping pretty close track, and I'm pretty sure that every single one of her assertions was inaccurate. Let me give you the big example, and then I'll come back around to your question. She said, hey, nothing happened here. The aide was released and the meeting happened. Now, you could look this up because I understand that the White House is all about making facts slippery, but both of those things happened. The aide was released and the meeting happened, not in the Oval Office. But the aide was released and the meeting happened after they were caught, after September 9th when the inspector general of the intelligence community came to Congress and said, there's this whistleblower complaint. And the White House, by the way, had seen that complaint. So when the jig was up, yes, then the aid was released once they were caught. But she's also wrong, just to get back to your question, I haven't spoken to all two hundred and forty or so of my colleagues, but-- but I don't think any Democrat in the Congress looked at what happened over the last two weeks and said, gosh, there's nothing there. Much to the contrary. Like the American public that was paying attention, my colleagues saw an ambassador fired for corrupt purposes, saw aid being held up, ad by the way, you know, she-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: --Kellyanne Conway may quibble about-- about what Sondland said. The Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said there was a quid pro quo, and we should get over it. So, no, there's not a Democrat who watched the last two weeks and said, gosh, this is a weaker case than I thought it was. MARGARET BRENNAN: So there are no scheduled hearings left. What-- what is left to investigate? The case doesn't seem to be closed. REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, you know, it's a little bit of a hard question to answer because, you know, again, whether you're Kellyanne Conway or Jim Himes, one thing is true, which is-- is that every single day and every single piece of testimony brought up new information. It might have been Laura Cooper who came to us, and the first thing she said was, look, I know the administration is saying the Ukrainians didn't know about this until late August, something that Kellyanne Conway repeated this morning, but she came to us in open testimony and said my office was actually queried by the Ukrainians in July. And I tell you that story because whether it's that or Bill Taylor appearing and saying-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: --oh my gosh, there was this phone call that was overheard where the President asked about the investigations. Every single day provides new and incriminating evidence. So it's a little hard to tell you that this thing is done. Look, the thing we need before we get into talking to Pompeo or Giuliani or anybody else. We need the e-mails and the paperwork that we have subpoenaed from the State Department and from the White House so we can look at what people actually said to each other. That's the critical thing here. MARGARET BRENNAN: As far as we know, there's no intention of handing them over. Are you in talks to actually have them deliver? REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, we are. We're pressing. And-- and look, this is another thing that we and the American people-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You think you will get those documents released? REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I don't know. Look, it's the decision of the White House and the decision of the Secretary of State. But the American people need to consider what is involved in the future if the President and the State Department can just tell Congress to go get lost. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about-- REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: That ends oversight. That ends the separation of powers. And that's a very scary thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Chairman Schiff said this morning that the committee is talking to Lev Parnas. He is one of the indicted associates of Rudy Giuliani. How far along is that? Do you think you need to hear from him? REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, again, I think it will be very interesting to hear what he has to say, because, of course, he was wrapped up in the other half of this that we don't know a lot about, which is what the heck Rudy Giuliani was doing in Ukraine. Obviously, Rudy Giuliani, private citizen affiliated with the President, was instrumental in firing an extraordinary public servant-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: --Marie Yovanovitch. So, I think Lev Parnas can shed some light on the whole unseemly activity that-- that Giuliani was up to in the Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and his attorney says he-- he would be willing to talk to your committee. One of the other things that his attorney has told news organizations like The Washington Post and CNN is that the ranking Republican on House intelligence, Devin Nunes, was in contact and trying to dig up dirt in Ukraine on Joe Biden. Is this a credible allegation? Is this something you are going to investigate? REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, so if you watched Devin Nunes for five minutes in these hearings, you know that he has given over to the utterly to the defense of the President and more importantly, to the propagation of fantastical conspiracy theories like this notion that the President keeps pushing that the Crowdstrike company, which, apparently, is a Ukrainian company, despite the fact, as you pointed out, it's actually a California-based company. Devin Nunes has given himself over to the search for and propagation of wild conspiracy theories, which, by the way, at their source are about Russian intelligence. So, this whole Ukrainian meddling in the election of 2016 has zero evidence for it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And it is deliberately propagated by the Russian state in order to create confusion. So, is it credible? And I-- look, I-- I don't know what happened on that trip, but the allegation is that Devin Nunes used federal funds to fly himself-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: --and a couple of staffers over there in the search of dirt-- dirt on Biden. That's actually what the President is accused of doing, misusing public dollars for a political purpose. Look, I haven't seen evidence one way or the other, but obviously-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: --Mister Parnas may be able to cast some light on that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see what happens. Some of your colleagues have called for the Ethics Committee to investigate. We'll have to leave it there, though. And stay with us for more FACE THE NATION. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but stay with us and we'll be right back with some impeachment analysis and our political panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We turn now to North Dakota Congressman Kelly Armstrong. He's on the Judiciary Committee, which is where the impeachment process is headed next. Congressman, welcome. Thanks for being here. REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG (R-North Dakota/@RepArmstrongND/Judiciary Committee): Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: As we said, you're on the committee where this process moves to next. Do you have any indication on what the timeline is and what this is going to look like as those articles of impeachment are drafted? REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: I don't. And I think we-- as we continue to move forward, I think the one thing that is true is that the Democrats are going to lose more and more control over this. I mean, at some point in time, Democrats are going to have to enforce some of the rules they passed on their own legislation. But regardless how you feel about this, this has been the most narrowly tailored and controlled thing by Chairman Schiff, both in the depositions, which I was a part of, and in the Intelligence Committee. But as it moves over-- over to the Judiciary Committee, they are going to lose more and more of that control. And for sure-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning what? REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: Just there are rules where the President gets to have his lawyer and those types of things. Now, I get a little concerned about those because with all of those rules, the chairman has-- has absolute veto power. But if they continue down this place, eventually, it's going to end up in the Senate and they're going to go there. And I think it's important. They were talking about the poll numbers this morning with Emmerson, and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: --there's a Vanity Fair article out that I think is probably the most important, and that is sixty-two percent of independents think that impeachment's more important to politicians. Sixty-one percent think it's more important to the media. So when you come from a state like mine and you continue to work through all of these things, I just don't think that as a political exercise, I don't think it has been a success-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: -- for the Democrats over the last two weeks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so put the political exercise apart from this, and in terms of what you actually heard testified to, someone whose name came up repeatedly was Rudy Giuliani. And federal prosecutors we now know are investigating his activities in Ukraine. Are you comfortable with somebody who's not working for the U.S. government being this involved in foreign policy? REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: I think your regular channels have been used a lot. And I've said this from day one. One of the reasons President Trump got elected is because he does things very differently. You know, whether-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what Rudy Giuliani was tasked with doing? REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: I don't. I mean, he was working through all of those things and working toward corruption and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Gordon Sondland testified that it was Rudy Giuliani who was carrying out the quid pro quo and that it was the President who told him to work with Rudy Giuliani. REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: Gordon Sondland testified that that was his assumption in the third-- third different testimony he gave because Gordon Sondland has given three different versions of the event. But when pressed on it by Republicans on the committee, he said that he never directly heard any of those things and it was only assumptions he was making. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he did testify on May 23rd that the President told him to work directly with Giuliani. But Ambassador Volker, who I know Republicans point to his testimony as Kellyanne Conway just did, he testified that it was Rudy Giuliani who was feeding President Trump this very negative view of Ukraine. And in fact, he was listening to that more than his own intelligence experts. Does that concern you? REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: Well, I don't think that's entirely true. I mean, Roll Call was covering Ukraine's involvement. Politico was covering it. And before you get into any of those things, the President has said, I mean, we know actively that Ukrainian government officials were actively campaigning against the President in the 2016 election. He was very clear. This President is skeptical of foreign aid. He was skeptical of the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about people who are no longer in the Ukrainian government who wrote Op-Eds that just said President, then-candidate Trump, was-- REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: Well, not-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --against Russia. REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: --not-- not just that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not-- are you-- I just want to clarify because we went through this just a few minutes ago. Are you actually believing the theory that Ukraine and not Russia hacked the DNC servers? REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: No, and I don't think that's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: --where you go. I mean, and-- but they are trying to make this a binary choice between Russia and the Ukraine, and that's not what it is. And if you listen to Ambassador Hill's testimony, I mean, she had an opening statement. But if you listen to her testimony throughout the course of the day, she acknowledged a lot of these things. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the reason we're talking about the Ukraine is because we have had two weeks of impeachment hearings regarding the Ukraine. Those things are mutually exclusive. And I think the Republicans on the Intelligence Committee did a fantastic job of pointing out that how Russia interfered with the 2016 elections. MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you be comfortable with a Democrat or any other President asking a foreign government to investigate a political opponent? REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: Facts of this thing don't change. And that-- I mean, and that's part of this. This-- this President was interested in how Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. He was interested in the corruption in Ukraine. He's always been skeptical of foreign aid. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: There was no favor. There was nothing that happened. The-- the aid was released. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the answer is you are comfortable? REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: I think the President-- I think there's only one person that gets away with talking the way he does, and that's President Trump and that's why the American people elected him. And that's one thing, again, as you see through all of these conversations that have occurred, is these career federal employees-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no one but President Trump should be allowed to get away with this? REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: No, I just think President Trump communicates in a way that is the reason why he got elected because he doesn't do the things the way everybody else does that. And you can tell that's a frustration from where we talk about career federal employees versus President Trump. President Trump said the phone call was perfect. President Zelensky has said on numerous occasions that he didn't-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And you accept all of this? REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: --feel the pressure. I do. I think you have the transcript and you have the two principals on the phone call that have stated that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: And after that, everything else is really just noise. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there. Congressman, thank you for joining us. REPRESENTATIVE KELLY ARMSTRONG: Thanks. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with our legal panel in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now to help decipher the Constitution and discuss what might or might not be technically impeachable are CBS News legal analysts, that's Jonathan Turley and Kim Wehle, and CBS News White House correspondent Paula Reid, who also covers the Justice Department. Good to have you all here. I say \"decipher\" because there is going to be a debate over how do you define high crimes and misdemeanors, which, along with treason and bribery, are how the Constitution lays out grounds for impeachment. I know because we've been talking all week that you think there is a case to be made for abuse of power. JONATHAN TURLEY (CBS News Legal Analyst/@JonathanTurley): There-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that what you think, you know, article of impeachment could be? JONATHAN TURLEY: There-- I-- I think you can make a case of-- for abuse of power, but you're going to have to do some changes. You've got to reschedule. You've got to reframe this case and you have to repeat some of this testimony because right now this seems designed to fail. It's an incomplete record. And the problem is you have an audience that is listening just to hear the lines they want to hear. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. JONATHAN TURLEY: When you step back and look at the whole, it is incomplete. And a member would have a good faith basis to vote against conviction on that basis. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard Will Hurd of Texas, the congressman, say at the conclusion of the hearing that he was not persuaded. And he is one of the so-called moderate Republicans who people had been hoping might be able to be persuaded to go along with Democrats. And he basically said I have not heard the case for bribery. Did you hear the case for bribery, Kim? KIM WEHLE (CBS News Legal Analyst/@kim_wehle): Well, bribery is expressed in the Constitution, and the idea is the framers did not want people in power using that power for their own personal gain. So if that's the definition, yes. And, of course, high crimes and misdemeanors is actually broader than just bribery and treason and includes things that can't be crime. So, for example, if the President were to move to the Kremlin and operate the White House out of the Kremlin, that wouldn't be a crime, but we'd say maybe that's impeachable. So there's some place in between just doing a bad job and-- and crimes and abuse of power. And I think we are squarely in that area right now with this President. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying it's a-- it's not-- but when people apply their sort of law-- law and order courtroom scenario to this particular case, you can't do that. It's not the same legal standard. KIM WEHLE: It's not the same legal standard. And it's really hard to wrap a lawyer's mind, my lawyer's mind, around what more we need, right, besides directly the President asking for this actual bribe so to speak or four hundred million dollars will be withheld, White House meeting will be withheld unless you announce an investigation into my political opponent. So we have interference in the election-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. KIM WEHLE: --again with-- by the President or part of-- with Rudy Giuliani. That's problematic number one and asking for foreign interference, which is banned by our federal campaign laws. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're skeptical with this. JONATHAN TURLEY: I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What would you need to hear to persuade you? JONATHAN TURLEY: First of all, this is not bribery. It doesn't-- the Supreme Court unanimously rejected this type of interpretation unanimously in-- in the (INDISTINCT) case. KIM WEHLE: For-- for a crime, right? JONATHAN TURLEY: Right. But, you know, you can't invoke bribery. And then when people point out this isn't bribery, say, well, this is impeachment. It doesn't matter. You're invoking bribery because it's a serious criminal offense. And they don't have a complete record. This is like hear-- hearing Hamlet from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern alone. You need to talk to the royal family. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. KIM WEHLE: It would be great if the White House would comply with the subpoenas. JONATHAN TURLEY: Well, but you-- yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to get to Paula on that because you had Kellyanne Conway here saying they are preparing for all scenarios, Senate trial or if the Democrats just don't move ahead with impeachment. What are they actually planning for? PAULA REID (CBS News White House Correspondent/@PaulaReidCBS): Well, this is all about the court of public opinion-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. PAULA REID: --as Kellyanne Conway said the White House Counsel's Office, the attorneys, they have hired, they are working on a legal strategy. But for the President, he is approaching this just as he's approached all the other investigations with aggressive messaging. And he is the messenger. But our recent CBS News poll showed about fifty-six percent of Americans don't think he is doing a very good job, which is why you saw them bring in Pam Bondi, Tony Sayegh to help with the messaging, but it's been interesting. This strategy has really divided the West Wing. While the White House Counsel's Office wants to be aggressive, protect executive privilege, there are others in the Chief of Staff's Office and elsewhere in the West Wing who want to be more transparent. They feel like, look, if we have nothing to hide, let's be more cooperative and the communications staff, the folks who work there every day-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. PAULA REID: --they are not very happy to bring other people in. So it's unclear if this strategy is actually-- actually been successful outside or inside the White House. MARGARET BRENNAN: Should we read into the fact that the legal team you just described, that communications team is not here-- PAULA REID: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --or anywhere this Sunday? PAULA REID: Absolutely. We saw one of the members, Pam Bondi. She was on CBS THIS MORNING earlier this week. She struggled with the basic facts of this case. So it does not surprise me that we now see Kellyanne Conway, who is one of the most effective advocates for the President, particularly when it comes to-- to legal investigations that she is now doing more of the forwrard messaging. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the other development that we still don't quite have clarity on, which is, A, what Rudy Giuliani's real role is. He's been very vocal on the past twenty-four hours or so. But also the fact that he himself is now the subject of an investigation. Is that a part of this story that you think needs to be fleshed out before Democrats go any farther? JONATHAN TURLEY: It is. I mean the Democrats have to decide if this-- if they want a real or recreational impeachment. A real impeachment means calling people like Giuliani and others to appear and then compelling them to appear. You can't create this-- the period, the shortest period of investigation in history for an impeachment and then impeach a President for failing to turn over documents in that period because he went to the courts. If that is obstruction for a President to seek judicial review in a conflict with Congress, then you could have impeached every living President, particularly Barack Obama, who made the same type of extreme interpretations when he refused documents of witnesses in Fast and Furious. So, you know, we-- at some point, adult supervision has to kick in here. And we have to decide, are we really trying to remove this President? And if so, the case has to be made. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is Rudy Giuliani's role, Paula? PAULA REID: He is still a member of the President's personal legal team. And he just-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Even though he is under investigation himself. PAULA REID: Yes, but he'd be gone quiet for a while. And then he burst back onto the scene over the last ten days. And I texted him, I asked him, I said, is this at the direction of the President? And he told me that he takes his instructions from his client. So it appears even though he is under investigation by the Trump Justice Department for his dealings in Ukraine, the President continues to retain him as one of his personal attorneys, even working on Ukraine. And I have heard and the President has said publicly the reason is the President still sees Rudy Giuliani as he was in 9/11. He believes truly that he brings gravitas to his case and to his defense. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it definitely keeps us busy. Paula, thank you. Thanks to all of us. We'll be back in a moment with our political panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) (Bernie Sanders dancing) MARGARET BRENNAN: That was Bernie Sanders doing some more dancing. Wonder if he'll still be having his time-- the time of his life-- dad joke-- with Michael Bloomberg now in the race, a billionaire. He talks a lot about them. We're going to have some analysis now for Rich Lowry. He is the editor of National Review and author of a new book, \"The Case for Nationalism: How It Made Us Powerful, United, and Free.\" Toluse Olorunnipa covers the White House for the Washington Post. He's also a CNN political analyst. Susan Page is the Washington bureau chief of USA Today. And Joel Payne is a Democratic strategist and CBS News contributor. Thank you all for being here. Rich, Michael Bloomberg used to be a Republican. RICH LOWRY (National Review/@RichLowry): He did. MARGARET BRENNAN: He-- he does have a record that he will have to explain in terms of policies when he was New York mayor, stop and frisk and the like. The allegation was nanny state in terms of, you know, restrictions on big gulps and things like that. But is he the kind of centrist Democrat that Republicans might be able to warm up to if they're not going to vote for Trump? RICH LOWRY: I think Michael Bloomberg is probably seriously annoyed everyone in the country over some particular issue over the course of his career, and just the theory of his campaign here, I've been wrong before, but seems preposterous. Skipping Iowa or New Hampshire usually doesn't work out well for candidates. But skipping the first four contests and then bludgeoning your way into the race through sheer financial force after that, after it significantly gelled just seems absurd to me and a way to spend a lot of money and make a lot of consultants rich but not win-- win many-- many delegates. MARGARET BRENNAN: And not any support from Republicans either. RICH LOWRY: Well, he's-- he has to-- he has the first-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think he's got a actual shot at being the nominee. RICH LOWRY: --part of the process is winning the Democratic nomination. Yeah. And prior to this point, early in polling, just didn't show very warm feelings for him among Democrats to begin with. MARGARET BRENNAN: Joel, is that also your read? JOEL PAYNE (Democratic Strategist/@paynedc/CBS News Contributor): I think that's right. I also have the, you know, ridiculous hot take that Democrats like to vote for Democrats and Mike Bloomberg is famously not a Democrat. He's an independent. I do think that he is trying to build goodwill with the party, not just with all of the ads that he's buying to spread his name, but he's also supporting a lot of Democratic progressive initiatives. Voter administration, he's spent a lot of money supporting gun control and climate change. So I think he has eased the lot of concerns and laid a lot of concerns with the leadership of the party. We'll see if that actually turns in the votes. Tom Steyer has tried it. It hasn't worked out. We'll see if it works for Bloomberg. MARGARET BRENNAN: He also supported a lot of Democrats in 2018. JOEL PAYNE: He did. He said-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So that must have won some goodwill. JOEL PAYNE: That-- that did win some goodwill. And, you know, the-- the Bloomberg candidacy is really-- it's a vote of no confidence for Joe Biden. I mean, Joe Biden was supposed to be-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You agree with Kellyanne Conway essentially? JOEL PAYNE: I mean, essentially, because the-- the theory of the case is that Joe Biden was supposed to be the person that owned that moderate middle lane in the Democratic Party. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JOEL PAYNE: It-- it has not worked out yet or at least the people behind Joe Biden probably don't feel that way quite yet. There's still time for the former vice president to earn that support, but he's got a lot of competition now with someone like Bloomberg. And, by the way, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, there are other moderates in the race who've come after his support. MARGARET BRENNAN: Susan, I know you're always looking at polls and polling. But these hearings just concluded on Thursday. For people who make the argument that they didn't move the needle really in favor of Democrats, are they making a judgment too soon and do you think that this impacts the presidential race in any way? SUSAN PAGE (USA Today/@SusanPage): You know I think the needle hasn't moved since the election in 2016. The-- the needle has been pretty well set for President Trump and for the opponents of President Trump. And-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You mean this was going to be a partisan vote no matter what. SUSAN PAGE: A par-- it's going-- going to be a partisan. This is the very reason Nancy Pelosi, the speaker, didn't want to go down the path of impeachment on the theory that you needed it to be bipartisan that was going to be very, very difficult. And you need it to persuade the public. That is also very difficult. So I think we end up kind of where we began. That the Democrats are convinced that President Trump is a-- is a-- a toxic President and most Democrats I think believe that he deserves to be impeached. Republicans are standing behind him. That's where we are. And the-- the-- the question of what this does in 20-- in 20-- the 2020 election is one I think is impossible to answer at this point. I think it is a fool's errand to try to look at the Clinton impeachment or any other history-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SUSAN PAGE: --to try to figure out how this is going to unfold over the next year. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because no sitting president has gone through an impeachment and a reelection at the same time. SUSAN PAGE: That's right. And because-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SUSAN PAGE: --we're in such-- we're in such unusual times-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SUSAN PAGE: --where we seem so frozen into tribal camps. MARGARET BRENNAN: Toluse, you heard Congressman Armstrong make the case that no other president really could talk like this and get away with it but that's okay. On Friday we saw kind of an example of how President Trump is vocal and unusual and really undeterred by this entire impeachment process when he gave that nearly hour-long interview live on Fox. What was that? TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA (Washington Post/@ToluseO): That was the President sort of giving his view of this entire impeachment process. And he is embracing conspiracy theories that even his staunchest repor--Republican supporters are not embracing talking about CrowdStrike and talking about Ukrainian hacking. It's clear that other Republicans are going to make excuses for that, they're going to say this is just the President. He still has a hold on our voters. He is someone who has been able to launch himself into the Republican-- into the top of the Republican Party and take control of the party. MARGARET BRENNAN: And said he would look forward to a trial in the Senate. TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA: Yeah. And for the President, this is a loyalty test. He wants to make sure that he has full loyalty from his party going into 2020. And anyone who breaks apart from him is going to suffer consequences both from the President's Twitter account and also from his primary voters. So he's been able to coalesce his party behind him, and the fact that you have Republicans saying, oh, this is just the way the President talks, no one else could get away with it means that you're not likely to see very many Republicans break from him, but independents will be the key roadblocks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Himes kind of gave an opening there indicating that they still were holding out hope the White House would produce documents as part of their investigation. Is there any change at the White House on that front that we know of? TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA: I don't think so. I mean, I think the President will release the documents that he thinks are-- are favorable to him, like he released the transcript of-- of the second call--(AUDIO CUT)--that happened in April that didn't really have--(AUDIO CUT)--profile witnesses and documents that may show what exactly happened. I mean, the White House has not been able to say why they withheld the aid. There's been no consistent argument-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA: --to explain what-- that-- what happened and everyone in the administration was in the dark about this. And I don't think they're going to release anything because I don't know that there's anything that sort of exonerating for the President to-- to show that this was a sort of a well-thought-out plan to withhold the aid for a specific reason and the Democrats are saying that the reason was all political. MARGARET BRENNAN: The RNC chair, Ronna McDaniel said this week, there is an absolute influx of smaller donations since impeachment has ramped that up. Is impeachment helpful to the President's reelection? RICH LOWRY: I don't know. I-- I think probably he'll be impeaching, acquitted, and two weeks later it will feel like old news the way everything feels like old news. And I think-- if these hearings were just on par with the Iran-Contra hearings back in the Reagan era, hearings to get the facts out, extract damaging revelations, dominate the headlines, they'd be a home run. The question, though, is whether this particular episode can bear the weight of impeaching and removing a President literally for the first time in our history, and to that question I think the answer is no. And you see-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, removal.  RICH LOWRY: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. RICH LOWRY: Removing, yeah. And on the cusp of reelection he very well could win. And I-- I think that's-- that's the-- the huge hurdle that Democrats can't get over. They're not getting over even with moderate Trump critics like Representative Will Hurd. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Joel, I mean, is the DNC also successfully fundraising off impeachment? JOEL PAYNE: I-- I think there's been a lot of hand-wringing, the suggestion that Democrats are on the defensive now. All the polling, I've seen actually demonstrates that this is still a winner of an issue for Democrats. It's still a plus-five or a plus-six issue for Democrats across the board. The CBS poll that I saw last week had it at plus-fifty percent supporting the inquiry, even with independents less than half of them opposed it. I think that Democrats are going to be watching what happens in some battleground states. But, broadly speaking, the timing here matters also. The fact that this will likely be wrapped up by MLK or Groundhog Day, the fact that for ten months Republicans are probably going to have to run on the idea that President Trump wasn't impeached or rather he was impeached, he wasn't removed but you still got to run on a record of trying to take away health care from millions of Americans, from locking up kids in cages. That's still a record the Democrats are going to push. So there's plenty of time for that to set in. RICH LOWRY: It's only going to be wrapped up so quickly because per Jonathan Turley's point earlier, they are leaving all the firsthand witnesses off the table, which they could secure if they waited a little bit longer and litigated it and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: John Bolton you're talking about? RICH LOWRY: Yeah, and Mulvaney and Pompeo and-- and Pence. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think they'd actually be allowed to show up? RICH LOWRY: I-- I think it-- it would be decided by the courts. I think there is a colorable at least privilege claim, immunity claim in all these cases, but you'd have to wait, two or three months. And they don't want to do that explicitly because it's a political timetable. So they're going to send an incomplete case to the Senate. SUSAN PAGE: No guarantee-- no guarantee in two or three months that you'd get these-- these witnesses. There's no guarantee by the Election Day you would get these witnesses. And Democrats have made the calculation that they've got enough in their mind to impeach the President so they should-- so they move ahead. This helps the President with his base. I think this hurts the President with that sliver--that small group of independent-minded swing voters in the middle. Many of them suburbanites, white college-educated people who voted for-- for him last time, abandon Republicans in 2018. I think it is a mixed blessing for the President. MARGARET BRENNAN: Toluse, what does the Senate trial actually looked like? TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA: Well, for the President it looks like trying to get Hunter Biden and trying to get all of these people who would be political opponents of the President to testify and dig up-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA: --dirt on them. But I think for the American people it could expose some of the things-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA: --that the President was doing, which does not look good even if it may not be impeachable in the minds of very many-- many Americans-- MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA: --definitely not a positive. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's going to be it for us today. Thank you all for watching.

            "article_content": "CBS NEWS - WASHINGTON BUREAUINTELLIGENCE MATTERS - JIM SCIUTTOCORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELLPRODUCERS: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON MICHAEL MORELL: Jim, thanks for joining us today. It is great to have you on the show. JIM SCIUTTO:Really appreciate the opportunity.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, Jim, your book, The Shadow War: Inside Russia and China's Secret Operations to Defeat America, that was published a couple months ago. So, congratulations on that.\tJIM SCIUTTO:Thank you.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And I want to spend a lot of time talking about it. But before we do that, I want to ask you about your service at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. You're a career journalist. So, how did you end up working for the U.S. Ambassador to Beijing?\tJIM SCIUTTO:This was one of those opportunities that came my way unsolicited but, when it came, I just felt couldn't turn down the opportunity. Just too much of a learning opportunity. And I'll tell you, I was at the White House Correspondents Dinner. This was in 2011. Happened to be the night of the bin Laden raid. No connection. But I found myself seated next to the incoming ambassador to China, Gary Locke. And I'd had a history of interest in studying China. And so, he and I ended up talking the whole evening about China. And then that led to a dinner and a lunch and a dinner. And then in those conversations, he came around to saying he could bring one person with him to China and he was looking for someone kind of outside the box, not a typical person from inside government, and asked me if I'd be interested. And I hadn't thought in those terms. But I thought here was an opportunity to be inside the U.S./China relationship at a critical time. My next question was to my wife, and she was willing. And then once she was, we decided to go.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yeah. So, what did you learn about the relationship, about the U.S. government, from being on the inside, as opposed to being on the outside, looking in?\tJIM SCIUTTO:Well, I think from the outside, particularly as a journalist, you can have an impression at times that folks, if they don't know everything, they know so much, right. You have these enormous resources of intelligence and, you know, just the reach of the State Department and access to information. And they do know a lot. But at the end of the day, you have people working with incomplete information, making the best decisions they can. You know that better than me. And trying to figure out how to make things happen. So, that was helpful. You know, as I cover -- and for most of my career, I've covered -- government and the intelligence agencies, State Department, et cetera, so it gives you a sense of how they operate, you know. They're doing their best, right, like all of us. They're doing their best with imperfect information. Don't always make the right decisions; sometimes, you know, make wrong decisions.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Sure.\tJIM SCIUTTO:But they do their best to get to the right place.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, did you have access to intelligence?\tJIM SCIUTTO:I did. I had a security clearance. You know, top secret, SCI, I did, which was-- listen, that was a privilege-- \tMICHAEL MORELL:Yeah, and what was your sense as a journalist, right, of seeing that? How much value did it add to your understanding vice what was available in open sources?\tJIM SCIUTTO:First of all, it's a privilege to do that. It's something you respect, as you know. You learn a lot. But again, you realize that it doesn't tell you everything; that you have tremendous resources, information, and then you have analysts doing their best to connect the dots. And it doesn't necessarily give you a perfect answer. And this is something when I cover intelligence, a whole host of stories, I always try to make this point on the air that, you know, intelligence is not some sort of magic, silver bullet. It's not a crystal ball, right.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Right.\tJIM SCIUTTO:It is a lot of information and folks make decisions. And in those reports -- again, as you know better than me -- oftentimes, they'll say here's what we know, here's what we don't know, and here's our best guess.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Okay, the book, which I think is terrific and I think everybody should read it. Why did you write it? Why did you choose to focus on this particular topic?\tJIM SCIUTTO:I'll tell you, as a journalist, through 20, 25-some-odd years of covering China and Russia, and being on the ground in places where the U.S. interacts with China and Russia, it struck me that we look at this relationship in, you know, one front at a time, as it were -- at least we in the public sphere and journalists -- and don't connect dots as to how this whole relationship is coming together, and that folks know about the election interference. They might know a bit about Russia's annexation of Crimea, so on, or China's manufacture of islands in the South China Sea. They hear about, you know, Russian bombers buzzing Alaska, or ships, et cetera, and look at them in general and don't connect the dots that, actually, this is a strategy for confronting the U.S., for trying to level the playing field with the U.S., undermine the U.S. where it can. Beyond that, what was interesting to me was that China and Russia, two very different countries, two different histories, geographies, languages, you name it, seem to have struck upon a very similar way of countering the U.S. And in fact, it's not a secret strategy. It's written in their documents, you know. We've come to call the Russian approach the Gerasimov Doctrine. This kind of hybrid warfare approach to countering the U.S. Chinese have a different name for it: Winning without fighting. You know, confronting the U.S., getting what you want, undermining where you can, but below the threshold of a shooting war. And that's the shadow war.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yeah, so that's the definition of a shadow war?\tJIM SCIUTTO:Yes.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Okay. So, have we seen shadow wars before in history? Or is this a relatively new concept? And if it's new, why now?\tJIM SCIUTTO:It's my impression that it is relatively new. I mean, shadow war tactics, individually, are not entirely new. There have been influence operations through the years, going back to Soviet times. There's been election interference. There have been, you know, small conflicts, short of all-out war, with the intention of territorial gain; all that kind of stuff. What struck me is that, you know, bringing these all together, particularly with technologies, is new. Part of it's a product of a single superpower kind of world, is that Russia and China know they can't beat us head to head in a shooting conflict. So, here's a way. You know, ultimately, it's asymmetric warfare, right--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Right, right, right, right.\tJIM SCIUTTO:--from two very formidable adversaries. But ultimately, it's asymmetric. And it's aided by new technologies. You know, the Russians, of course, have interfered in past elections. Cyber capabilities super charged that, right. Then there are other elements of this which I think a lot of Americans just aren't aware about. And one that I'm particularly fascinated with is the space element, is that, you know, we've become more dependent on space; people are generally aware of that. But they don't know that Russia and China have space weapons deployed right now, with the intention of being able to blind us, weaken our capabilities militarily and even in the civilian sphere, in the event of a all-out war, but even short of that.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yeah. So, maybe we've seen elements of shadow wars before, but now it's come together as an actual strategy. Maybe that's what's new--\tJIM SCIUTTO:Yes, yes, exactly.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, you just said something really important, is that most Americans don't understand this, right. Why not?\tJIM SCIUTTO:Because frankly, our leaders aren't talking about it that way, right. They're not connecting the dots for them. And that's at the very top. It's even on Capitol Hill. You hear pieces of this. I mean, the president's certainly talking about a trade aspect of this. The president talks about the theft of private sector and national security secrets, which is-- I got a whole chapter in the book on that, too. That is part of the shadow war. Again, it's a way to level the playing field; steal our most sensitive secrets. But connecting it into a bigger picture is something that you just don't see. Now, if you talk to folks in the intelligence agencies, in the national security sphere, they're beginning to think in this way; the national defense strategy. They talk a lot about these capabilities. But the American people don't hear it sufficiently. You know, you asked me earlier why I wrote the book. One is seeing these patterns and trying to draw attention to them. But the other piece is just I'm an American, you know. I spent a lot of time in these countries, covering these countries, and I do it driven by a sense of public service that I feel I don't do with any political motivation whatsoever. If you read the book, you see that I spread the blame around a bit for the slowness among American leaders, officials, et cetera, to see this happening. It's not a political issue; it's an American issue.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Okay. So, China and Russia, the two antagonists. What I'd love to do is take them one at a time. And so, let's start with China. How is China specifically waging a shadow war? What tools are they using? What battlefields are they choosing?\tJIM SCIUTTO:Okay. Let's take it through. One, theft of our deepest secrets. It's certainly true in the private sector sphere. I mean, this is one of the essential issues of the trade war, right, is that U.S. companies, when they operate in China, first of all, they don't have the same access that we give Chinese companies; but also, Chinese companies up and steal their intellectual property. They do it every day. Sometimes that's part of the agreement. Sometimes they just up and steal it. Beyond that, China is waging a very successful cyber campaign to steal our national security secrets. I focus on just one man in the book, a guy named Su Bin, who, over the course of four years, with two partners in China, stole hundreds of gigabytes of data on three of America's most advanced military aircraft: the F-35, the F-22, and the C-17. And folks in the Pentagon will know that China's flying three planes that look a lot like the F-35, the F-22, and the C-17--\tMICHAEL MORELL:They look a lot like it; yes, they do--\tJIM SCIUTTO:And you know this better than me--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yeah, yeah.\tJIM SCIUTTO:And I interview in the book, Bob Anderson, who used to be in charge of the FBI's counterintelligence efforts. And I asked him what percentage of Chinese operations like this is the FBI aware of, and he said, if we're lucky, one in ten; 10%.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Wow.\tJIM SCIUTTO:So, for every Su Bin, you made the point-- and they caught Su Bin. Granted, after four years. He's currently in prison. They did catch him but he did a lotta damage before then. For every Su Bin, there are nine others who -- that we might not know about.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yeah, okay, so thousands--\tJIM SCIUTTO:Yeah, so that's one front, theft. Space. China has, today, floating at low earth orbit, medium earth orbit, and up to geostationary orbit, satellites that China claims are maintenance satellites or friendly objects in space, but that U.S. Space Command, and I spent a lot of time at Space Command for the purpose of this book, views as, at a minimum, dual-use technologies. But satellites that are weapons, in effect, that can either blind our satellites with directed energy weapons-- I always tell people, there are already lasers in space. They could ram them, old school, just blow them into smithereens. But China also, in the last couple of years-- U.S. Space Command discovered them testing and deploying a satellite with a grappling arm that has the capability of lifting another satellite out of orbit. Now, the Chinese say, 'Well, we have got repair our satellite. What better way to fix it?' (LAUGH) U.S. is not so certain of that. And they've seen China test this capability right up to geostationary orbit. That's 22,000 miles up. To do that requires tremendous technology, situational awareness in space, et cetera. The U.S. is concerned about space. And China knows we have a tremendous advantage in space, particularly militarily. So, that's a good place to try to take us down. Then, submarine technology; China making big advances. Russia as well. But China has diesel electric submarines that are very quiet. One of them popped up in the midst of a U.S. carrier group couple of years ago; scared the bejesus out of them. Because when you don't know where a sub is, that allows that power to project nuclear power right up to your shoreline. And then the final point I'll make is, old school, 19th century -- as President Obama called it -- territorial acquisition. Although, China, putting a new twist on it, in the South China Sea, just up and manufactured, you know, a territory which has since been militarized.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Right. So, what's the motivation on the part of the Chinese? What are they trying to achieve here?\tJIM SCIUTTO:Big picture, long-term, to up and surpass the U.S. as the most dominant global superpower. It's been in their documents, in their strategies, going back to 1949. Michael Pillsbury wrote a book about this: The Hundred-Year Marathon. And they write about it. So, this is about retaining or getting back what they see--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Getting back, right.\tJIM SCIUTTO:--as their rightful place at the top of the world. The middle kingdom at the back of, you know, the middle of the universe. So, that's part of it--\tMICHAEL MORELL:With every other country being its vassal?\tJIM SCIUTTO:Exactly. And there's a lot of history. There's a lot of politics and nationalism behind that; a sense of our position having been stolen away by the West and we're going to get it back, rightfully. That's a piece of it. On the other side, to at least make it a fight with the U.S. in the event of going to war. You know, U.S. intelligence officials will say China doesn't want to go to war, and you'll hear that about Russia, too. But if they do, they want to be able to play on a level playing field. And those go together, you know. And they call the strategy winning without fighting. Ideally, they get what they want below the threshold of a shooting war. Again, that's the art of the shadow war. But if they have got go to a shooting war, they want to be ready to fight.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Is there a domestic political aspect to this?\tJIM SCIUTTO:In China?\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yeah.\tJIM SCIUTTO:Absolutely. You know, I always say that China is not a democracy but it has domestic politics. That factors into the whole trade war right now and that, you know, China is as loath not to be seen as backing down to the U.S. as the U.S. is--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Absolutely, absolutely.\tJIM SCIUTTO:--to China. So, this idea that Xi's suddenly going to buckle, you know, I think we should be skeptical of. But big picture, again, particularly when you speak to the Chinese today, and I spent a lot of time there-- I love the country. So many good friends there. There is, not far below the surface, a lot of pride and a lot of nationalism. 'This is our time,' you know. And again, the people share this sense that they had their rightful decision taken away. I will say that, generationally, it's concerning. Because when I was in China, when I would go to universities and meet with students, what struck me is the students were more nationalistic than their teachers. Because the students have only lived in a world where China is on the rise. And that should be concerning.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yeah, you know this long-term aspect that you talked about? I had dinner one night with four Chinese intelligence officers and they were talking about good and bad millennia. So, they were talking about this good 1,000 years, this bad 1,000 years, right, and we're focused on quarters.\tJIM SCIUTTO:Yeah.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Right?\tJIM SCIUTTO:Yup.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, Jim, one of the chapters in your book focuses on the South China Sea. And I think you give a really good, excellent history of the issue. How would you summarize what happened there for Americans who might not necessarily have followed it?\tJIM SCIUTTO:Okay. So, just for background, South China Sea, it's right in the middle of the most important shipping lanes in the world; 40% of world commerce goes through there. But also on top of what is perceived to be enormous natural resources. It's hundreds of miles from the Chinese coast. They claim it as their own, historically. And then you have half-a-dozen other countries who claim it, who are much closer, by the way--\tMICHAEL MORELL:It's great to actually see a map of their view--\tJIM SCIUTTO:It is, exactly.\tMICHAEL MORELL:--of the South China Sea, right.\tJIM SCIUTTO:Well, you got Vietnam. You have Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines -- treaty ally, the Philippines, by the way -- who all say that it's their territorial waters. And it is worth, if you're at home, just google a map of this because it's pretty darn far away from the Chinese coast. And historically, they have a map you might hear referred to as the nine-dash line, where, a few decades ago, they just drew a line that kind of encompassed it on kind of dodgy historical basis. Anyway, you have a bunch of rocks down there. They're above the surface of the water, at low tide kind of thing, that, starting in 2014, though these areas were disputed, China just goes in there, starts building islands. They start dredging up the dirt and piling the dirt on top, adding thousands and thousands of acres of land over the course of just a few months, claiming them as their own. And then over time, adding things like long runways and hardened hangars and surface-to-air missile sites. I had the opportunity, and I tell the story in the book, of flying on a U.S. surveillance plane over the South China Sea in May, 2015, a P-8, as it was flying over these islands, which is part of the U.S. strategy here. Listen, we consider this international airspace. Therefore, we're going to keep flying over it. And we watched from up there as they were building this stuff. There were 20, 30-some-odd dredgers in each of those islands and they were making fast progress. Now, China gave an assurance to President Obama they would not militarize, and they broke that assurance. And now, China has what the navy sometimes refers to as a few unsinkable aircraft carriers in the South China Sea.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Okay, so let's shift to Russia. I'm going to ask you the same set of questions, okay. So, how are they waging the shadow war? What tools are they using? What battlefields are they choosing?\tJIM SCIUTTO:Okay. So, battlefields very similar to China's. So, one, certainly in cyberspace, election interference being the most prominent, but not the only one. And that's something that they did quite effectively in 2016, attempted again in 2018, and there is no question. It's not a question of if but how much Russia attempts to interfere in 2020 when you talk to anybody in that space--\tMICHAEL MORELL:It's going on right now.\tJIM SCIUTTO:And it's happening as we speak. And talk a lot about this in the book, that some of this is election focused, but a lot of it is permanent in that it's every day. You know, their intention is not just to influence the election itself, but to influence the political conversation in the U.S. and seek any division and exacerbate that division. That's why they love to occupy spaces like Black Lives Matter, gun control, even Take a Knee. And Michael Hayden, I interviewed him for the book, he has a great story in there. And he's written about this more extensively, about, you know, it was obvious to U.S. intelligence when Russia started to get into the Take a Knee space, you know, of course, the protests in the NFL - taking a knee during the National Anthem - because they were often miswriting the hashtag. Instead of 'take a knee,' they were saying take the knee. And Michael Hayden makes the point, you know, that articles are often the toughest thing to get right in foreign languages, and that's how they knew that those were-- was an easy way to spot that those were Russian trolls who were putting them in. So, it's an ongoing influence game, influence campaign, by Russia in cyberspace. Russia also has weapons in space today, and the U.S. has watched them. They shadow sensitive U.S. commercial and surveillance satellites, circling them like a U-boat circling, you know, a freighter during World War II. They circle them up in space, testing these capabilities, both with the possibility of ramming and destroying satellites, or blinding them with directed energy weapons, et cetera. Submarines. I got to take a trip on a U.S. nuclear submarine under the Arctic where they were doing - and they do these every couple of years - the ICEX exercises.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Being a journalist is cool, right?\tJIM SCIUTTO:You know, it's funny. And particularly, you know, if you eat this stuff up like me. It's funny. I was on that sub under the Arctic on my birthday last year. And a lot of my colleagues were like, 'Oh, it's a shame you had to spend your birthday \u2013' And I was like, 'You kiddin' me?' It was the best place I could imagine. And they made me a cake. But, practicing up there in these exercises, tracking Russian subs in what is a new frontier in this, a new great game over influence in the Arctic. And what the commanders will say is that Russian subs are getting quieter and harder to detect. And like with China, although Russia's capabilities are more advanced, a submarine that's quieter and harder to detect could pop up off your coastline and, in the event of war, launch nuclear missiles. So, there's a military competition. There's a cyber competition. There's a space competition. And then finally, there's old school, 19th century, land acquisition. Ukraine, you know. They up and stole a piece. Crimea, in 2014. They still occupy large parts of eastern Ukraine as well--\tMICHAEL MORELL:First land grab in Europe since World War II.\tJIM SCIUTTO:Exactly. And I tell folks all the time, because I think people think of the Ukraine as a million miles away. I was like, it's in Europe, you know. It was seeking closer cooperation with the E.U. And, you know, if Russia can do that there, where do they do it next? And that's the concern.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, their motivations, right, how does that compare to China's motivations?\tJIM SCIUTTO:So, big picture, Russia, and it struck me as interesting, driven by the same sense of regaining its rightful place in the world. Although, the theft of its rightful place is more recent. They go back to 1991, the collapse of the Soviet Union. Their perception, you hear this a lot from Putin, that they were taken advantage of by the West, et cetera. So, getting back to being relevant again in the world, that's one piece. You also have a sense that they're zero-sum game players. Any chance they get to stick their thumb in the U.S. eye is a win for them. There's a little bit of that. So, I think those two factors. What struck me is a connection between China and Russia in this sense, is that Chinese leaders study the fall of the Soviet Union intensely because that's a cautionary tale for them. You know, the CCP -- the Chinese Communist Party -- they're like, 'We're not going to be those guys. We have got to watch that we don't collapse the way they did.'\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, there was one chapter on Russia that I found particularly interesting, and that's a chapter on Estonia. What happened in Estonia in 2007?\tJIM SCIUTTO:So, this is the first chapter in the book. And I look at this something as the first salvo in the shadow war. I mean, of course, there were signs before. But in Estonia, in 2007, Russia launched really the first and the largest nation-on-nation cyberattack. It was a cyberattack intended to really shut down and cut off Estonia. Estonia is this remarkable country right on Russia's border. Couple million people there, but extremely technologically advanced. I always remind people Skype started in Estonia. They got a pretty good track record. But they've also been way ahead of the curve on doing things digitally. They voted digitally first. They banked digitally. You know, very dependent on this. So, around 2007, really ahead of the game for us, they're more dependent on these things than we were. And Russia launched a giant DDoS attack, in effect. They took over thousands, tens of thousands, of computers in more than 100 countries, created these big botnets that basically flooded Estonia with requests for information, shut down their news, government websites, banking websites, et cetera. While, on the ground, they had kind of manufactured riots, you know, with ethnic Russians, you know, sort of expressing themselves. That kind of thing. Scared the bejesus out of the Estonians. Because I spoke to folks; spoke to the defense minister who was in charge at the time. Their concern was, 'Was this the preface to a land attack,' you know? And they had a lot of reason to be concerned about that. But even short of that, it was enough where, eventually, Estonia, just to get back on its feet, had to turn off the switch and cut the country off. And it was a warning sign many years before, for instance, the interference in the 2016 election; many years before these kinds of attacks that we've come to see more often -- North Korea's attack on Sony and elsewhere -- but at a scale and with a skill that really was a warning of how far Russia was willing to go, and how powerful cyber capabilities could be.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, would you call it kind of the first shot in this shadow war--\tJIM SCIUTTO:I do, I do, and I don't want to be too-- you know, exaggerate, because there were aggressive acts prior to that, and aggressive statements by Putin. But in terms of a nation-on-nation attack, yes, in many ways, the first one.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, that's just a great transition I think to American awareness of the shadow war, right. You said earlier that you think we were slow to see this, slow to realize it as a government, as a country. Why?\tJIM SCIUTTO:I had the benefit in this book of speaking to a lot of current and former officials who were directly involved in the administrations, Republican and Democrat as this was happening; Jim Clapper, Michael Hayden, current head of Strategic Command, John Hyten, Ash Carter, former defense secretary, John Scarlett, used to head the MI6. And what they said, self-critically in fact, was that they fell victim to mirroring with both Russia and China. Mirroring in that looking at Russia and China and saying that they want what we want. Welcome them into the international system. They will liberalize. They will democratize. They will see. Russia will see, if you invite them into a partnership agreement with NATO, that this is good for all of us. When, in reality, they looked at that system and those organizations as skewed to our will and inherently skewed to our interests. And there was a lot of contradictory evidence through the years, even as leaders -- again, both parties -- and officials kept to that assumption. They had trouble kind of jettisoning that assumption, and they're doing so now. Ash Carter also makes the point that, by the way, we had 9/11 and we had two wars going on-- which-- and your resources were focused elsewhere--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Exactly, exactly. So, Jim, now that we do recognize it, right, how would you characterize the American response so far?\tJIM SCIUTTO:It's coming together. It's not there yet. They're discussing strategies. At the military, national security level, you have the agencies and the departments beginning to respond. I spent time in the NSA for this. And you know, they are aggressively defending against cyberattacks. And under the Trump administration, you had a step forward; the president enabling Cyber Command to be little more forward-leaning in terms of offensive measures. You know, planting cyber weapons that you could turn on, in effect, in the event of the need for retaliatory action. So, you have some moves in cyberspace. Still a debate underway about how to respond to the space threat. There are reasonable concerns about if you weaponize as well, do you create a new space arms race, and will that make things even worse. But certainly, Space Command is thinking in defensive terms about hardening satellites. I spoke to officials who talked about kind of sending up the equivalent of carrier escorts with satellites to allow them to defend against these weapons. So, cyberspace. With submarines, there is an effort to bring more advanced submarines online more quickly to respond to this, to operate in places where you didn't have to for a while, but now, by the way, Russia and China are back there. I mean, I remind people, one consequence of the Syria war is now Russia, again, has a naval base in the Mediterranean. They're operating in the Mediterranean. So, you have steps at that level. But what still hasn't happened is our leaders articulating a strategy across the board. But also I think making Americans aware of the nature of this conflict at this point. And at each level, if you talk to the sub commanders, if you talk to the guys flying the spy planes, you talk to folks in the NSA ops center, they will say, to win this, you need a whole-of-government response. And that requires presidential leadership and that's something that they haven't heard yet. And it's not Obama administration officials who are saying that. It's the folks on the front line who are saying it.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Right, right, right. How do you think we're doing on managing that, and to what extent do you think the politics of Russian interference is getting in the way of us doing what we need to do to stop the political influence?\tJIM SCIUTTO:Enormously, because, we could just say it, it's a matter of public record, you have a president, commander-in-chief, who denies at times that the interference even took place, or at a minimum, that it's important. You know, we're an environment now where facts are partisan things. And even national security issues have become extremely partisan things, because we know that the president-- his senior officials are told not to bring up election interference with him. He makes it an automatic association with his victory. But that then gets to resources being directed at defense. And you see that not just with the president but if you look at the U.S. Senate. You know, why is it so hard to get election security measures through at this time? Because even that question has been politicized. And that's a problem. And again, you know, when you talk to the folks who are fighting it on a daily basis, or even when you talk to city lawmakers of both parties who are briefed on the threat, they will tell you there's no doubt it happened, it's happening, it's important. And they're getting better at it. And yet, those things have had doubts cast upon them for political reasons, and that weakens the American response.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, did you give any consideration to adding Iran to this piece? Or is it more contained, geographically, and therefore, you--\tJIM SCIUTTO:It did. I did consider adding both Iran and North Korea, because both of them use shadow war tactics. You know, it's asymmetric warfare. So, by nature, smaller adversaries, they really have no choice. It's logical. It makes sense. It's good strategy. And you know, North Korean and Iran have directed energy weapons. They don't quite have the capabilities of Russia and China. But in terms of dazzling satellites or blinding satellites-- what happened in the Persian Gulf in the last month or so --clear shadow war, yeah.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Shadow war, right, absolutely--\tJIM SCIUTTO:I mean, like, the plausible deniability on these explosives placed on the ships, that kind of thing. And as I was watching it, I was like, 'Man, you know, that's right on the mark.' I mean, the reason I focused on Russia and China is, one, because when I ask the intel folks consistently, what are your top threats, they will always put Russia and China at the top, partly just because of size and their nuclear powers. Doesn't mean Iran and North Korea can't do damage. So, that's part of it. And the other piece that struck me is just that these are two very different countries and yet, they've struck on this similar approach for dealing with and undermining the U.S.\tMICHAEL MORELL:They figured something out here?\tJIM SCIUTTO:Yup, they did.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, a couple of final questions, Jim. Number one, in both the introduction and conclusion of the book, you draw a parallel between the shadow war, today, and American's foreign policy in the 1930s. Talk about that.\tJIM SCIUTTO:Here's the thing is that if we time traveled ourselves back to the 1930s, before, you know, 1939 invasion of Poland, before Japan's invasion of China in 1937, you had saber-rattling by these countries, you know, at the time that was often dismissed. Say, 'Listen, we can talk to them. We can find common ground. Let's not get too caught up in this.' Well, and then this was a key point that always stuck in my mind. Give them a little and then they won't want more, right? Like, give them the eastern stretches of Europe and they're not going to want to come this way. You know, let Japan make trouble in China. That's as far as it's going to go. Now, I don't want to say, you know, that this is the equivalent; that we're facing World War III here, necessarily. But it does strike me that that kind of aggression, if it's not countered, then is encouraged. And that's the concern. And don't take my word for it. That's the concern of the folks who are on the front lines of this. Even if it's smaller bore than a full-on war. Because if you give a signal that it's okay to occupy Ukraine in the first invasion since World War II, what are you saying about Estonia, a NATO ally? If you give ground in the South China Sea, have you sent a signal about Taiwan? When I ask folks in the Pentagon with both China and Russia, what are the two next possible flashpoints that are at the top of their mind, they'll say Taiwan in Asia and Estonia. You know, so it may not be on the same scale, but the lesson is the same, that, you know, granting aggression doesn't normally end too well.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, that's the second question. So, you end each chapter with a section called Lesson, right. Why did you do that?\tJIM SCIUTTO:And I'm far from a teacher or a professor. I do feel that, in this environment, in this news environment, information environment, people are kind of inundated with stuff and stories and information and warnings, et cetera. And I just wanted, at the end of each chapter, to just, in a couple pages, bring it down to say here's what the smart people are telling me about what we've learned from this front or this war and the next wave forward. And I try to tie that in at the end in a final chapter where I ask the smart people-- I said, 'Okay, give me ten steps for how to respond to this.' And those steps are not crazy ideas. They're not even that difficult, at the end of the day. Things like clear leadership and setting clear red lines. But I just thought that that was an-- you know, to make this stick, I wanted to tell folks the way forward.\tMICHAEL MORELL:The book is The Shadow War: Inside Russia and China's Secret Operations to Defeat America. The author is Jim Sciutto. Jim, thanks for being with us.\tJIM SCIUTTO:It was great to talk to you. It's a real honor. Thank you.\t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - ANGELA STENTCORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELLPRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS MICHAEL MORELL:Welcome to Intelligence Matters, Angela.\tANGELA STENT:Very glad to be here.\tMICHAEL MORELL:You know, as you know, one of the key national security issues facing the United States is the international behavior of the Russians. And you've just published I think a very important book on why Russia does what it does. It's called Putin's World: Russia Against the West and with the Rest. It's fantastic to have you on the show.\tANGELA STENT:Well, glad to be here. (LAUGH)\tMICHAEL MORELL:Perhaps the place to start, Angela, is to get your perspective on, what are the Russians actually doing in the world, you know, from a kind of big-picture perspective? And then we can dive into why they're doing it and what we should do about it, right? And then maybe also get into a little bit about Moscow's approach to different parts of the world. But how you would you, to start, how would you characterize what they're doing in the world?\tANGELA STENT:So Putin came in as president with one of the goals was to restore Russia as a great power. And to put behind Russia what he considered the humiliation of the 1990s. So one thing they're doing is showing the rest of the world that they are a great power, despite their economic weakness. And that they need to have a seat in the global board of directors. They should be asked about any important international decision. So that's one thing they're doing, showing their presence and saying to the world, \"You cannot ignore us. You have to treat us with respect and to take our interests legitimately.\"\tMICHAEL MORELL:And what are the specific things that they do to that end? Like, Syria, for example?\tANGELA STENT:Right. Well, in Syria, you know, the West tried to isolate Russia after the annexation of Crimea and the Russians launching a war in Southeastern Ukraine. And Putin's answer to that was to go and start bombing in Syria. He was concerned that Assad might be defeated, which indeed, he might have been. And Russia has saved him. Russia is now, you know, a major power there. Back in Syria, and it was again, done by bombing. And in many ways, the way they do this is by disrupting. You can see this now even in Venezuela or a country like that. It's to go back to areas maybe where Russia withdrew after the Soviet Union collapsed. But just to make it difficult for the West to achieve its goals.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yeah, so great power. Anything else? Pursuit? Or is that the driving force here, the driving objective--\tANGELA STENT:Well, I mean, there's also a domestic imperative. This is a group of people that want to stay in power. They've accumulated a very large amount of money which they don't want to lose. They don't know what's going to happen in the next leadership succession. So it's also using the foreign policy to try and keep themselves in power. And Putin has very skillfully appealed to the Russian population, to their patriotism, you know, to increase his popularity numbers. Because they were falling, for instance, before the Crimean adventure.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And how does that play out? So that plays out in a place like Crimea. Does that play out in other places?\tANGELA STENT:It's played out particularly in Crimea, to some extent in Syria. In the beginning, again the Russian population apparently was proud that Russia was back there, was showing the Americans that they couldn't push them around. I believe there're somewhat diminishing returns with that now. And maybe we can come back to that later, given the economic state of the country. But that is still something that apparently appeals to the Russian population.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So you say something very important in the book, Angela. And that is that, most people focus on Putin the man in explaining Russian behavior. But you think, you know, that's obviously important, but you also think that there's a bigger issue here. And that's Russian the nation, Russia the nation state. Can you talk about that a little bit?\tANGELA STENT:Yes. I think Putin sort of exemplifies forces that have been at work in Russia for hundreds of years. And that is, first of all, the Russian sense that they are an exceptional civilization. They're different from the West. The Russian sense, and I quote a famous 19th century poet there, that \"The West will inevitably be their enemies.\" That they are going to be opposed to the West. That the West isn't really going to serve their interests. And I think the other thing is, the sense of Russian insecurity, because it has no clear borders, except in the North. And you've always had this tradition for hundreds of years of expansion of Russia's borders absorbing its neighbors, then retreat when it's defeated, and then reabsorbing those neighbors again. Yeah.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Well, where does this sense of exceptionalism come from?\tANGELA STENT:Oh, I think you probably have to go far back in history. The way that the Russian state was formed, the role of the Russian Orthodox Church, and the fact that, you know, Russia has developed a civilization that is different from that of its Western European neighbors.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So does this mean that Putin doesn't matter that much? That if it wasn't Putin, it would be somebody else like Putin? You know, how much of this is history and tradition and culture and worldview on the part of Russia, and how much of this is Putin?\tANGELA STENT:So I think any leader who would have taken over from Boris Yeltsin, because the '90s was a time of chaos, of impoverishment in Russia. And you had a leader who wasn't very well towards the end of his tenure in office. So I think anyone who would have taken over from him would have wanted to restore a stronger state and would have wanted Russia to resume at least a regional, if not a more global role. But to restore Russia as a power that mattered in the world. I think the particular way that it's happened under Putin is unique to him, given his background. You know, a mid-ranking K.G.B. official, a case officer who served in East Germany, then someone who served in the office of the mayor in St. Petersburg. The mayor was sort of democratic leaning, but that's when they began this sort of rather corrupt system of acquiring assets of the economic system we see in Russia today. And Putin, like many leaders, has surrounded himself with people who come from a similar background. So he rules with those close to him, many of whom are from the security services. And so I think that has made a difference. Because I think if you'd had someone who did not come from an intelligence background, it's possible that their relationship with the West wouldn't be quite as bad as Russia's is today.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So can you describe him? What kind of person he is, what his personality's like, personality traits, characteristics. How would you describe Putin the man?\tANGELA STENT:So I mean, my encounters with President Putin have been at these annual Valdai Club meetings in Russia, where they bring over foreign experts on Russia. And we meet with various leaders, including President Putin. This is someone who's pretty well-informed on issues. When he's in smaller groups and you ask him questions, he doesn't refer to some assistant who's standing next to him. He's particularly interested in things like economics and energy. He can reel off statistics. He has some very strange notions of history which are quite amusing sometimes. But I would say, this is someone who's in command of the facts. Can be quite direct and almost rude to people when he wants to be, but seems to, he exudes by now, self-confidence.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So looking back at his experiences, both as a young man, and then as a K.G.B. officer and then as you said in the mayor's office in St. Petersburg, how did those experiences shape him?\tANGELA STENT:So he grew up poor, in post-war Leningrad. And this is just a little more than a decade after the Siege of Leningrad had occurred, when the Nazis tried to starve out the city, and a million of its inhabitants died in Leningrad. And his parents lived in a communal apartment like most people did in those days in the Soviet Union. So they were poor, and apparently he was an indifferent student in school. And then what apparently raised it up was when he decided to take up Judo. And in an autobiographical series of essays that was published when he first became president in 2000, he refers to the playing Judo, I mean, the learning Judo, and that that was the sport that enabled him to transcend this rather mediocre, if you like, background. And then also apparently learning German, which he then did very well. He had a German teacher who saw the promise in him. So if we're to believe this book, this is how he then managed to do reasonably well in school. And then got himself into Leningrad State University to study law. And we also know again from this book that he had wanted to join the K.G.B. as a young age. And at age 16, he presented himself to the K.G.B. And they said, \"Come back, and you know, we'll talk to you later.\" So I think growing up, I mean, another book has been written about Putin, describing him really as a survivalist. And I think that's part of it, growing up in this post-war Leningrad in poverty and in rather bleak circumstances. And then he went to East Germany. He was a young man in his 30s. And I think what really influenced him there was, first of all, he enjoyed living in East Germany. It had a much higher standard of living than the Soviet Union did. He lived better there. But then, what happened to him, of course, in 1989 was, when the Berlin Wall came down, he was in a building co-located with the East German Security Services, and, you know, the mob came up and demanded the files. They wanted all their files. They wanted to know what was going on. And so he describes again, how spending all night in this building burning papers so that nobody could get hold of them. And saying that, no one in Moscow was there to help him. In other words, profound feeling of being abandoned by the Gorbachev people after all of this happened. And then leaving East Germany earlier probably than he would have, and coming back to as it then was still Leningrad, but without a job really. And then, finally finding work in the mayor's office, and there, this was something new. He was in charge of foreign economic contacts. And that's when we know he got together with, you know, a group of his friends. They all bought dachas, country houses, in the same place on the outskirts of then what became St. Petersburg. And they apparently started to accumulate wealth. He had all these contacts with foreign business people. And that was the time when he first met Henry Kissinger, for instance. But apparently, he was his driver when he was driving around St. Petersburg. So you have these dual biographies there. And then, he was brought to Moscow in the mid-1990s. Another thing that I think affected him was, in 1996, the mayor for whom he worked, Mr. Sobchak, there was a rather dirty reelection campaign, and Sobchak lost. And that was also something that apparently influenced Putin. And he realized that, if you have an election and you don't know who's going to win, you know, that can turn out badly. And so then again, he was out of a job, but then he was brought to Moscow. And the reason why Yeltsin picked him apparently was because he was persuaded that this was going to be a loyal man. He promised President Yeltsin and his family that nothing would happen to them. Once--\tMICHAEL MORELL:How well did he know Yeltsin prior to being chosen?\tANGELA STENT:I don't think he knew him that well. I think it was people around Yeltsin like Boris Berezovsky and others who recommended Putin to him. I don't think he knew him that well.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And do you have a sense of whether he was successful at his career at the K.G.B.? How he was doing when this all fell apart?\tANGELA STENT:So if you read the memoirs of the man who used to be in the East German Secret Police as the head of their international operations, Markus Wolf, he'll say, this was someone who was barely on his radar screen. He was in Dresden. Dresden was not one of the major cities in East Germany, it was kind of a backwater, and that he was a mid-level lieutenant colonel in the K.G.B. I don't know how you would judge how well he did, but he certainly wasn't well-known.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Angela, how are foreign policy decisions made in Russia? You know, is there a process? Who's at the table? Is it really only a small group of advisors, as we hear? You know, so the decision on doing Syria or the decision on Ukraine, how does that actually happen?\tANGELA STENT:Well, of course, we all wish we knew, and we have some of the finest minds in the United States in the intelligence agency trying to figure this out. This is a government that's run by people who come from the security services. So having said that, what we understand is, there is a national security. There's a security council, which certainly meets regularly and discusses tings. As far as we understand it, on the very important decisions, it would be President Putin and just a few people around him. It could be the defense minister. It could be the head of the S.V.R., that's the foreign intelligence services. It could be the head of the domestic intelligence services. It could be maybe a few other officials depending on the issue, who will sit with him and will discuss these matters. We know that the foreign ministry doesn't really seem to have much of a say in any of these decisions, and that often the foreign ministry finds out about things, for instance, what happened with the Russia-Georgia War and other issues, after they've taken place. Unlike even in the Soviet period, there are very few institutions where you can identify, this is what this particular branch, this institution, this office does. On less important foreign policy decisions, it's a wider range of people. But it's very much I think still people believe President Putin and a small inner circle.\tMICHAEL MORELL:In your book, you wrote that the foreign minister wasn't involved in the Ukraine decision, for example.\tANGELA STENT:Yes, as far as we know, he wasn't. Annexation of Crimea was something they found out about afterwards.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So you believe, Angela, that Putin has largely achieved the objective that you said he was after, right, which is managing to return Russia as a global player. So he's been successful at what he has set out to do. How do you think he thinks about that, and how do you think he thinks about where to go next? \tANGELA STENT:So in my book, I do also point out there are areas where he clearly hasn't been successful. I mean, the whole episode in Ukraine, he has managed, or Russia has managed through its actions to unite Ukrainians in a way that they weren't united before. There's always been a split between East and West. That seems to have diminished much more, and Ukrainians seem to have developed a much stronger sense of national identity. And I think, he would probably also look out and acknowledge at some point, that his desire to reintegrate the post-Soviet space has been only partially successful.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And what does he want to do in that post-Soviet space? Does he want to actually physically control it? Or does he just want to have significant influence over it?\tANGELA STENT:He wants to have significant influence, and he doesn't want any of the post-Soviet states to join any Euro-Atlantic alliances, i.e., N.A.T.O. or to join the European Union. That I don't think, he doesn't want to create the Soviet Union, recreate it, because I think he can't. But he wants to feel, again, going back to this kind of sense of space and insecurity, that the borders of the former Soviet space are really the security perimeter of Russia. And so that none of Russia's neighbors, particularly Ukraine, should move closer to the West.\tMICHAEL MORELL:You know, it's kind of interesting. The way you described Russia, right, as being this insecure nation and therefore the need to show that it's powerful actually kind of sounds like Putin himself, as a person.\tANGELA STENT:Yeah, I think that's probably true. (LAUGH) I think, given the fact that he grew up in, you know, the second city in the Soviet Union that he, even when he went to East Germany wasn't sent to East Berlin. So yes, it's trying I think to compensate for some of that too. And using the skills that he learned, probably both as a Judo-ist, as the Russians call it, and in the K.G.B., using his skills to take advantage of the distraction of the West, the mistake the West makes. In other words, Russia, right, where the per capita G.D.P. is less than that of Italy, which has a declining population, a crumbling infrastructure, its very limited resources, but making pretty savvy use of those resources to reassert Russia.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So maybe now we go to Russian foreign policy region by region here a little bit, which I think you did a fabulous job in your book. Let me throw them out and get you to react to each one of them. The first would be Europe, and I should say that I found it interesting that you talk about, from a Russia perspective, right? You talk about Europe from a Russia perspective as both a model and then N.A.T.O. as the enemy.\tANGELA STENT:Right.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Can you talk about that? That's fascinating.\tANGELA STENT:So I would say, traditionally for Russians, Europe has been admired as an economic model. In other words, you get Peter The Great, first of all, in the 17th century setting out incognito, traveling Europe to try and learn how, you know, the Europeans managed to have such an advanced economy. So there's always been an admiration for that, you know, even under the Communists. What the Russians have been much more wary of is kind of, if you like, the idea of Europe. The ideas that European states have put forward, starting with the Enlightenment, the Renaissance, the Reformation. All of the things that Russia itself never experienced like that. And so those are the ideas of the rule of law, of due process, of individual liberties and human rights. And their successive Russian rulers at least have been very wary of those. And so what Russia doesn't like about the European Union is first of all, the idea that a group of countries would give up their sovereignty voluntarily. For Putin, absolute sovereignty, the sovereignty of big powers, is very, very important. And then, the fact that all these European countries can get together and agree on things like sanctions. And even if individual countries don't like the sanctions anymore, if the leading countries like France and Germany believe in them, then they continue. And what the European Union explicitly is, is a community of values. And so whenever the European Union deals with Russia it talks about values. So that's the European Union. Now N.A.T.O. has always been viewed, you know, since the Soviet times, as the main enemy. And after all, it was founded in 1949 to contain the Soviet Union. And despite the fact that N.A.T.O. after the collapse of the Soviet Union declared that it didn't see Russia as an enemy and it wanted to work with Russia, it established a N.A.T.O.-Russia Council where N.A.T.O. works with Russia. Despite all of those things that wariness really has remained there. And then, of course, the other thing that the Russians, although they didn't complain about it at the time, but have retroactively complained about it, was the enlargement of N.A.T.O. And starting off with Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in 1999 where Boris Yeltsin didn't really say very much, but they didn't love it. And then, of course, in 2004, when you had a big enlargement which included the Baltic States. And now-- and since then-- Russia has claimed that, you know, N.A.T.O. is a number one danger. At a time when N.A.T.O. itself said, \"We want to work cooperatively with Russia,\" that's not what the Russians said. But by now, of course, from the N.A.T.O. point of view, Russia is a major challenge and adversary because of what's happened in Ukraine.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Do you think Russian behavior would be any different if N.A.T.O. enlargement didn't come to Russia's border?\tANGELA STENT:Right. So this is, of course, a subject of big debate. People have said, \"If only we wouldn't have enlarged N.A.T.O., this was the original sin, everything would be fine.\" I'm really not so sure about that, because N.A.T.O. enlargement in the beginning was largely done also to prevent the Central European States who still held a lot of historical grievances against each other, to get them, you know, the Romanians and Hungarians, for instance, to agree that they didn't have territorial claims on each other. To get the Central European countries to be in an alliance where they accepted the other ones' borders and worked together. If there wouldn't have been N.A.T.O. enlargement, what would have happened to all of those countries? They would have just been kind of bouncing in a no-man's land in between. And then you probably would have had the temptation for Russia to reassert its influence there. So I am not convinced that if there hadn't been N.A.T.O. enlargement, we'd have a much better relationship with Russia.\tMICHAEL MORELL:The Middle East. How do you think about Russian foreign policy in the Middle East?\tANGELA STENT:So there I see that as one of Putin's two successes really. And that's the return to the Middle East in fact, probably a more successful way than the Soviet Union was ever there. Because under Putin, Russia hasn't chosen sides. The United States has chosen sides, right? We see Iran as a major adversary, and a lot of our policy in the Middle East is directed in that way. The Russians now are the only power in the region that talks to all sides in all disputes, to Iran and the Shia groups, to all the Sunni states, and of course, to Israel. And it's very pragmatic. It's nonideological. And what I see is, for instance, Russia's two newest partners, if you like, Saudi Arabia and Israel, are both American allies. They both would like Russia to use its influence to temper Iranian ambitions in the region. Although, I think they overestimate the influence that Russia has. But there you see in the Saudi case, a lot of this is about oil production and oil prices. And the Russians are now working with the Saudis and O.P.E.C. to try and keep production down. With Israel, it's about the war in Syria and about the fact that 1.3 million Israeli citizens, you know, come from the former Soviet Union. But then, you know, expanding its links with Egypt, for instance by closer ties now, economic and military. And it's seen as an arbiter there, as a neutral arbiter, in the way that the United States is not--\tMICHAEL MORELL:And in a way that we're not.\tANGELA STENT:Yeah. I mean, the U.S. is obviously much more powerful than Russia, and Russia can't replace the U.S. militarily or economically in the Middle East, but yeah, the U.S. is not seen as a neutral arbiter.\tMICHAEL MORELL:You also talked a little bit about Putin's personal reasons for an interest in relations with Israel, that I thought was really interesting.\tANGELA STENT:Yeah, so ironically, whatever you can say about Putin's Russia and what it's like to live inside Putin's Russia, from the point of view of their ability to exercise their religion, this is probably the best time that Jews living in Russia have ever had, in terms of religious liberty. And, you know, he writes about this again in this 2000 autobiographical interview, that he grew up in this communal apartment, and there was an elderly Jewish couple there that was very kind to him when he was growing up, so, and which he talks about. And he's, you know, he's visited the country. Quite often his favorite German teacher eventually emigrated to Israel. So there apparently is some personal reason. And we know that some of the oligarchs to whom he's close are also Jews.\tMICHAEL MORELL:China may be the big enchilada here, China. You talk about growing cooperation between the two. The director of national intelligence at the last Worldwide Threat testimony, made a big deal about the growing cooperation between the two. You note in your book that Xi Jinping last year said, quote, \"Putin is my best, most intimate friend,\" unquote. What's the basis of this relationship? Is it tactical? Is it strategic? How do you think about that?\tANGELA STENT:So I think it started off being more tactical. But I think now, not to exaggerate it and say it's an alliance, but it is quite strategic. I mean, these are two countries that feel that the post-Cold War order hasn't taken their interests into account. And that they need to have more agency in it. And they're both committed to what they call, a post-West order. Now, I think their ideas of what that is are different. What Russia wants is probably different from what China wants. Obviously, China as the rising economic power has a different interest in this as Russia. Russia is the junior partner but in this relationship. But, so they share a desire to change the way that really that the world is run. They're very sensitive obviously to any Western attempts to interfere in what they consider their domestic prerogatives. So neither country's going to criticize the other one for lack of democracy and for persecution of human rights--\tMICHAEL MORELL:And that's why both oppose intervention anywhere else in the world.\tANGELA STENT:Right, exactly, and so the whole concept of what we talk about, humanitarian intervention, they will disagree with this. The only humanitarian intervention the Russians will agree with is helping, you know, the people in Eastern Ukraine who didn't want to be part of Ukraine. So I think it's a worldview that's similar. It's the Chinese, you know, they need large amounts of energy, and they've now gotten a good deal with Russia. After the sanctions were imposed after the annexation of Crimea, the Chinese were able to negotiate a major gas pipeline deal with Russia on terms that the Russians would not have accepted before the sanctions. But they didn't have any choice. And for the Russians, you know, the Chinese back them up on all of their major foreign policy issues. The Chinese did abstain when the general assembly voted to condemn Russia for the annexation of Crimea. They did not support the Russians there, but in general, they vote together on the United Nations Security Council. And the Russians support the Chinese on all of their major foreign policy issues. So it's pragmatic. It's instrumental. But we now see military cooperation for the first time. You had Chinese troops participating in Russian military exercises last fall in the Eastern part of Russia. We now see there's going to be more sort of training and cooperation with the Air Force. So slowly, the military aspect of this I think is getting closer.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Angela, I want to ask about the dichotomy. You raised this earlier, but I want to come back at it directly. The dichotomy between Russia's role in the world and the size and health of its economy. Right? How is that possible?\tANGELA STENT:So throughout the centuries, when Russia first became a grew power in the 19th century, it's always only been able to act as a great power by virtue of its military presence or ability to project military power, rather than economically. Because it's always been economically behind Europe, behind the more developed countries. And Russia is able to do this. And I think part of this is in the post-Soviet realm, Russia is by far the strongest military power. So that's easy. It's, you know, easy for them to do whatever they've done in Ukraine, to send soldiers there. I mean, the Ukrainian Army isn't a match for them. Or in other parts of the, you know, in the frozen conflicts of the post-Soviet space. That's easy. In Syria, you know, what they've done in Syria they've done with fairly limited resources. They haven't, not that many soldiers and airmen have gone there. The casualties haven't been that big. So they managed to do that on a fairly tight budget if you like. And even what we see now in Venezuela will be interesting to see what happens there. But so far, you know, it hasn't cost them so much. So they're able to project military power on the cheap, fairly successfully, particularly in areas where they're surprising the West or where the West doesn't want to respond. I mean, obviously, the U.S. and N.A.T.O. is not going to go directly against the Russians and Ukraine, even though N.A.T.O.'s beefed up its troop presence in that area. And I think that is how they are able to do it. None of these are massive military interventions.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And the other tool they use, right, is very capable intelligence services. And at the end of the day, intelligence is not that expensive.\tANGELA STENT:No, exactly. It's the intelligence services, and they, as we know, they are very good. And as we know in our own case, they've been able to exploit obviously the weaknesses, both in social media and in the cyberspace to their own advantage.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Angela, at the end of the day, here's one of the things I struggle with. At the end of the day, when I look at Putin and Russian foreign policy, I wonder whether it serves the long-term interests of the country or not. Or is it actually doing a disservice to the long-term future of Russia? How do you think about that question?\tANGELA STENT:So the, I think you'd have to think about it, that in the long run, what the Russian leadership should do is reform the economy in such a way that Russia will become a fully modern country. It's not a modern country. It doesn't have modern institutions of governance. It's largely a raw materials exporting state. And if you compare it to its neighbors, China, but even not China, smaller countries in Asia, they're going to go ahead, and Russia is going to remain at the, you know, much lower level economically, without a modern economy. But I always caution this. When I worked at the National Intelligence Council and other places where people sit down and do scenarios, you try and think what the future is. And you always look at the fundamentals, and you say, the Russians can't go on like this. Their population's declining, you know, they're not modernizing the economy. And at some point, things can collapse. But we do know from history that the Russians managed to carry on and muddle along. You know, they surprise us when they do that, more than we think they will. So I do think that in the long run, I don't see that Russia is really served by a foreign policy that antagonizes the West that much. It would be better from the Russian point of view and economically for them too if they, if we had better relations, because they've got much more, you know, Western investment and things like that. So and we know that there's, you know, as long as Russia continues the way it is, there's a significant brain drain of their most talented people, who are not staying in Russia. That they're emigrating to Europe or the United States or Australia. So in the long run, this doesn't serve their interests that well.\tMICHAEL MORELL:But cutting through the nationalism, right, to get to what you're talking about would be extremely difficult--\tANGELA STENT:Right. That would be difficult, and the long run, you know, is some way away. And it's certainly beyond the tenure of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Angela, let's finish up with a couple questions on U.S. policies. You write in the book that, \"The West has had flawed assumptions about Russia.\" What are those flaws?\tANGELA STENT:Well, I think we were probably overly optimistic, although understandably overly optimistic in the 1990s when the Soviet Union collapsed. And I think particularly in the Clinton Administration, believing that Russia did want to move towards the West, and if only we gave them the wherewithal and worked with them to do that, that would be their choice. And I think again, if you go back to history, and you look at the long-term factors I think for many Russians, you know, developing more like the West or being integrated more with the West would have to them been seen as something where they had very little agency, and they were junior partners. And I think we underestimated the degree to which the loss of great power status or however it was presented to the population really had a very profound impact on people. And so I think those were flawed assumptions. That doesn't mean that we can't work with Russia, or we couldn't were circumstances better. But I think the future, the U.S. has to be more realistic about what Russia is and how it's likely to develop.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Were those flawed assumptions shared broadly by Russia experts? Or you're really talking about the people making policy?\tANGELA STENT:Well, it was people making policy, but interestingly enough, some of the most tough anti-Soviet thing, you know, experts, academics, think-tankers, they were very enthusiastic. Because I think a lot of people maybe focused too much on the fact that the reason the Soviet Union had acted the way it has, it was because it was at least nominally a Marxist, Leninist, Communist country, even though it probably didn't believe that. And not realizing enough that a lot of what informs the way that Russia acts is Russianness and is going back, you know, into Russian history. And that the ideology that you saw in the Soviet period was kind of superimposed on historical traditions that have reasserted themselves.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Did the I.C. share in this mistake about the assumptions, or was the I.C. more sober and more realistic?\tANGELA STENT:I think they were probably more sober and realistic, which of course, led to all the debates, you know, that we know about now about whether, you know, Gorbachev and people like him were just sort of a passing phenomenon.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And if we applied the more accurate assumptions, right, about where this policy is coming from, and how enduring it is, what should be our policy?\tANGELA STENT:Well, I think we do, you know, we have to work with Russia on some issues. We should have very realistic expectations, but there are issues. For instance, arms control, I mean, we have a major treaty that's going to expire, the new S.T.A.R.T. Treaty in 2021. These are areas where, as the world's two nuclear superpowers with what, 93% of the weapons, we do need to work with the Russians. And there are other areas where we could work with the Russians. We have worked with them, not always successfully on counter-terrorism, but sometimes it's worked. So we have to define narrowly where we need to work with them, and but not have any illusions about the fact that they're going to move any closer to our view of the world than we have at the present. And then, and there are other issues. You compartmentalize the relationship. The Arctic, this is an area where we're both working together with them. And as we now read, there's also a military buildup, and we can become competitors there. So probably we're now in a stage where we are again global competitors in a way that we weren't before, even though, again, the U.S. is much stronger than Russia still. And identify those narrow areas where we can work together.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And where they're creating that turbulence in the world, what do we do?\tANGELA STENT:So there we have to really devise better ways of deterring them. You know, and of countering them. Clearly, first of all, issues like cyber, election interference, which continues to today, we have to build up our defenses and where appropriate, respond to them. But so far, we haven't done very well in deterring Russia. And I think we're often surprised by what they do. And so I think we have to be somewhat better at, you know, thinking about where they might go next, of being forward-looking and thinking about that, although that's difficult.\tMICHAEL MORELL:The author is Angela Stent. The book is Putin's World. Angela, thanks for taking the time to be with us.\tANGELA STENT:Thank you.\t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "In the wake of two deadly mass shootings over the weekend, including one motivated by racism, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and Washington Governor Jay Inslee is releasing a plan aimed at stemming gun violence related to white nationalism. The proposal, obtained exclusively by CBS News, is a 10-point plan with broader gun safety measures, such as a national assault weapons ban. But it includes efforts more focused on white supremacists, like creating a system that would identify, track and prosecute white nationalist extremists.\u00a0 \"No one in America should ever live in fear because of the color of their skin, where they were born, or who they love.\" Inslee said in a statement released by his campaign.\u00a0 \"We need a president who will take on the twin epidemics of rising white nationalism and rising gun violence that have cost too many American lives.\" Inslee's plan would reinstate and expand federal funding for \"de-radicalization programs, intervention grants, and investigative resources,\" in addition to dedicating \"federal law enforcement resources to the task of leading joint federal-state investigations of white nationalists.\" The plan also would enact tighter gun control measures including Extreme Risk Protection Orders, which would allow police, family members and household members to \"petition for firearms to be temporarily removed from people threatening to harm themselves of others.\" This is a tool that is already in use in the state of Washington. Inslee also proposes closing the Charleston Loophole, which allows a firearms dealer who has initiated a background check to proceed with a sale at his or her discretion if the FBI does not respond to the check after three business days. Finally, Inslee's plan would ban untraceable firearms. The campaign calls this decision a response to \"the Trump State Department's decision to agree to allow blueprints for such 3D firearms to be freely distributed online.\" A CBS News\u00a0poll\u00a0found that a majority of Democratic voters favor more gun control with 62% saying that they must hear a candidate speak on the issue before voting for them. Inslee, along with many of his fellow Democratic presidential candidates, has blamed the rise of white nationalist terrorism in part on President Trump. Though the president condemned white supremacy and racism in a speech Monday, Inslee released a statement deriding Mr. Trump's remarks. \"Today's performance by President Trump was an embarrassing attempt to avoid responsibility for his own actions.\" Inslee said in a statement released by his campaign.\u00a0 \"It's time for Donald Trump to take ownership for his encouragement of hate and violence in America. From hateful chants at his rallies, to racist tweets, to praise for white nationalists, this president has done more to divide the United States than any leader in modern history.\" Some key Republicans in Congress are also calling for tighter gun restrictions.\u00a0 Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) tweeted to express his support for common-sense legislation, including giving states the power \"deal with those who present a danger to themselves and others.\" Like Inslee, he supports Extreme Risk Protection Orders and plans to introduce legislation on this.\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Monday that \"Senate Republicans are prepared to do our part.\" But McConnell has not proposed any specific gun measures. Here's Inslee's plan: Tim Perry is a reporter covering the White House for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Steve King, the controversial Iowa Republican, on Tuesday voted in favor House resolution condemning his comments supporting white supremacy and nationalism, saying he agrees with the language in the resolution of disapproval. \"What you state here is right and it's true and it's just,\" King said on the House floor, before the measure received a 424-1 vote.\u00a0 House Democratic Whip Jim Clyburn had put forward\u00a0a motion of disapproval condemning white supremacy and white nationalism, days after the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0published an interview in which King said white nationalism and white supremacism were not offensive terms. \"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\" King asked in the interview, published last Thursday. \"Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\" The only person who voted against the measure was Rep. Bobby Rush, an Illinois Democrat, who said he does not believe it was strong enough, and he would like to see King censured. The resolution comes as some Republican leaders are stepping up their pressure on King, with the number three House Republican leader saying he should not be in Congress. \"I think he should find another line of work,\" Rep. Liz Cheney, the GOP Conference Chairwoman, told reporters, echoing comments made by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Monday.\u00a0 McConnell said in a statement, \"There is no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind. I have no tolerance for such positions and those who espouse these views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms. Rep. King's statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. If he doesn't understand why 'white supremacy' is offensive, he should find another line of work.\" Congressional Republicans issued a sharp rebuke to King on Monday, barring the veteran lawmaker from serving on any House committees as punishment for his comments. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who had\u00a0pledged to take \"action\"\u00a0against the Iowa lawmaker on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, told reporters on Monday evening that the party's steering committee had voted unanimously to deny King any committee posts in the current congressional session. King had served on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business Committees in the previous Congress. Cheney called the removal of King from committee assignments a \"very significant and serious step.\" \"We have been very clear,\" she said, calling his views \"absolutely abhorrent.\" Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, meanwhile, was more blunt, and called on King to resign. \"Steve King's comments are reprehensible. They have no place in polite society. And certainly no place in the Republican party,\" Romney told reporters Monday evening. \"And they should have no place in the United States Congress. He ought to resign and move on and let someone else who represents American values take his seat.\" King, in a statement, said his comments had been mischaracterized by the Times. He reacted to McCarthy's move by calling it a \"political decision that ignores the truth.\"\u00a0 Sen. Tim Scott, who wrote an opinion piece for the Times soon afterward criticizing Republicans for their silence on King's comments, did not demand he leave the House. \"I have clearly not called on him to resign and I'm not going to call on him to resign,\" the Senate's only black Republican senator told reporters Tuesday. He added that he doubted King would resign.\u00a0 Some Republican leaders were noncommittal on whether King should leave Congress. Asked by reporters whether King should resign, McCarthy said Tuesday that \"I think that's up to Steve King,\" noting that \"it's still early\" to know whether he is even planning on running for re-election. And Sen. Jodi Ernst, an Iowa Republican, said that \"I trust that the good folks from IA in the 4th District  will make the correct choice moving forward.\" King is facing a primary challenge in 2020 from state Sen. Randy Feenstra. In 2018, King fended off a challenge from Democrat J.D. Scholten, although he won by a narrower margin than he has in the past. McCarthy also was asked if President Trump shares his views on King. \"Which view is that? That we need border security? Yes, he does,\" McCarthy said, avoiding the question. When asked about King on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"I haven't been following it. I really haven't been following it.\" Alan He, Rebecca Kaplan and Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Iowa Rep. Steve King, one of the most right-wing members of Congress who has attained notoriety for his controversial and white-nationalist positions, is facing a primary challenge in 2020 from state Sen. Randy Feenstra. King fended off a challenge from Democrat J.D. Scholten in 2018, although he won\u00a0by a narrower margin than he has in the past. Feenstra argued in his announcement of his primary challenge against King that \"Iowa's 4th District doesn't have a voice in Washington, because our current representative's caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table.\" Indeed, King's history of controversial comments caused the National Republican Congressional Committee to rescind all support for him before the 2018 election, with NRCC chairman Steve Stivers saying in October that King's positions constituted \"white supremacy and hate.\" King has supported far-right politicians in Europe such as Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Marine Le Pen in France and autocrat Viktor Orban in Hungary. In August 2018, he gave an interview with an Austrian site affiliated with the country's Freedom Party, which was founded by neo-Nazis. In that interview, he agreed with the idea that white Europeans were being replaced by foreigners and criticized Democratic donor George Soros, who is a common target of anti-Semitism. King also endorsed white nationalist Faith Goldy, who once participated in a neo-Nazi podcast, for mayor of Toronto. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds criticized\u00a0King\u00a0in November for controversies about his views on race and ties with people linked white nationalism,\u00a0CBS affiliate\u00a0KCCI Des Moines reported. \"I think that Steve King needs to make a decision if he wants to represent the people and the values of the 4th District or do something else, and I think he needs to ... he needs to take a look at that,\" Reynolds said at an event a week after the election. Reynolds' criticism came after\u00a0The Weekly Standard\u00a0released a tape last week that they say shows King, an eight-term congressman who won re-election last week, calling immigrants \"dirt.\" Several of King's corporate contributors\u00a0also said they'll no longer donate money to him. Purina Petcare, part of Swiss-based food conglomerate Nestl\u00e9 S.A., followed Land O'Lakes and Intel in vowing to end campaign contributions to King. Feenstra said in his announcement that he was a staunch conservative, making the point that this should not be construed as\u00a0 a challenge from the left. He also referred obliquely to the controversy around King, saying Iowa doesn't \"need any more sideshows or distractions.\" \"What we've seen this past week from the new Democratic majority in Congress is appalling,\" he said. \"The president needs effective conservative leaders in Congress who will not only support his agenda, but actually get things done.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

McAuliffe had previously set a self-imposed deadline of March 31 for announcing his intentions.\u00a0 \"I have made hundreds and hundreds of calls across the country, talked to potential staff and, listen, we're close to making a decision,\" McAuliffe said Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" Asked whether he was waiting for former Vice President Joe Biden to make his own decision on 2020, McAuliffe said he isn't, but said he \"wants to see where the field is.\" McAuliffe is a longtime ally of the Clinton family and served as Virginia's governor from 2014 to 2018. \"I do think we need in this race a progressive governor who was very jobs-oriented, very successful in economic development. They're not mutually exclusive,\" said McAuliffe. \"A governor is CEO. We build roads, we fix roads. We do need governors in this race because, you know, we don't just get to talk all day, we've got to to deliver every single day.\" McAuliffe has flirted with a 2020 run before, saying on \"The Takeout\" podcast in 2018 he thinks he would beat President Trump in a head-to-head matchup. The Democrat has been vocal about his opposition toward Mr. Trump,\u00a0questioning his leadership skills in the wake of the violent clashes in the Charlottesville, Virginia.\u00a0He discusses those sentiments in his forthcoming book \"Beyond Charlottesville: Taking a stand against White Nationalism,\" due out this summer. The former Democratic National Committee chair would enter the race with considerable experience on the presidential campaign trail. He served on former President Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign and was chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign. Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "While speaking to a conservative group in Iowa, U.S. Rep. Steve King wondered if there would be \"any population of the world\" remaining if not for people born as a result of rape or incest, reports the Des Moines Register. It's not the first time comments by the Republican congressman have sparked an uproar, and it drew immediate criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. \"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest?\" asked King at the Westside Conservative Club in Urbandale, Iowa on Wednesday, according to the Register. \"Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?\"\u00a0 He went on to say that considering \"all the wars and all the rapes and pillages\" that took place in the history of the world's nations, he couldn't rule out that he, too, \"was not a part of a product of that.\" King was defending his decision not to allow exceptions for rape and incest in the anti-abortion legislation he attempted to pass in Congress, the Register reports. He added that babies born through these circumstances are still a person, despite the way in which they were conceived.\u00a0 \"I've got 174 people [in the House of Representatives] who say they don't want exceptions for rape and incest because they understand it is not the baby's fault, to abort the baby, because of the sin of the father, and maybe sometimes the sin of the mother too,\" King added.* The comments quickly came under fire from other lawmakers \u2014 including Republican leaders, who stripped King of his committee assignments in January over comments he made\u00a0defending white supremacy and white nationalism. Minority Whip Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, said of King's latest statements, \"These comments are wrong, and offensive, and underscore why we removed him from his committees.\" Iowa GOP spokesman Aaron Britt issued a statement saying, \"These comments are outrageous and are not reflective of the views of the Iowa Republican Party.\" Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming also weighed in on Twitter. \"Today's comments by @RepSteveKingIA are appalling and bizarre,\" she\u00a0wrote. \"As I've said before, it's time for him to go. The people of Iowa's 4th congressional district deserve better.\" Today\u2019s comments by @RepSteveKingIA are appalling and bizarre. As I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s time for him to go. The people of Iowa\u2019s 4th congressional district deserve better. Many Democrats called for King to step down. \"Steve King must resign,\" wrote Sen. Elizabeth Warren in a tweet Wednesday. \"His latest comment is a disgusting attack on victims of sexual assault.\" She also encouraged Iowa voters to support King's Democratic opponent in the 2020 race for his seat in Congress, J.D. Scholten. (King is also facing a\u00a0Republican primary challenge.) Steve King must resign. His latest comment is a disgusting attack on victims of sexual assault. The people of #IA04 deserve better. We must work together to elect @JDScholten in 2020. https://t.co/y5QDB4ToHc Sen. Kamala Harris\u00a0tweeted, \"Rape apologists have no place in Congress.

He should not be a member of the United States Congress. https://t.co/QZbXSEFpdw At a town hall meeting in Hardin County, Iowa, later in the day, King lashed out at members of his own party for punishing him. He said Leader Kevin McCarthy made a \"big mistake\" in taking away his committee assignments, and vowed, \"I will turn the pressure up on this. ... Something is going to happen. I may win I may lose. But I am not going to back off.\" -CBS News' Alan He and The Associated Press contributed reporting.\u00a0 * Editor's note: An earlier version of this story, relying on information from The Des Moines Register, inaccurately quoted King as saying, \"It's not the baby's fault for the sin of the father, or of the mother.\" King actually said, \"I've got 174 people who say they don't want exceptions for rape and incest because they understand it is not the baby's fault, to abort the baby, because of the sin of the father, and maybe sometimes the sin of the mother too.\" Danielle Garrand is a social media producer and trending reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Here's what you need to know in politics this week... CAN DEMS SUSTAIN THE NEW GUN CONTROL PUSH? Via political director Caitlin Conant and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe:\u00a0More than a week since the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, can the national focus and debate on gun control policy sustain itself? Or will something else come along to serve as the next hot issue of concern? Over the weekend, 16 Democratic presidential candidates appeared at a forum hastily-arranged by Everytown for Gun Safety, the umbrella organization for groups pushing for stricter gun laws bankrolled by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\u00a0 In an interview that aired on Sunday's Face the Nation, Bloomberg told CBS News' Margaret Brennan that he was \"optimistic\" about background check legislation passing Congress, but also noted that it \"depends on Mitch McConnell bringing a bill to the floor in the Senate and it still depends on the President of the United States signing a bill.\" New gun control laws require momentum, and with Congress in recess and President Trump away from D.C. this week, will the 2020 Democratic candidates be able to effectively keep the pressure on Republicans and keep the issue on the minds of voters in the coming days with no big forum or immediate example of gun violence? Evidence of how it might keep up came early Sunday, when former HUD Secretary Julian Castro announced plans for his tenth visit to Iowa this week and said he will attend \"a town hall on his plan to disarm hate by combating white nationalism and gun violence.\" The forum is being held in North Liberty, Iowa, a relatively new and young bedroom community, certainly by Iowa standards, that is especially popular with young couples and families in the state's more liberal eastern side. The event is being sponsored by a local chapter of Moms Demand Action, one of the groups that sponsored the weekend gun violence forum in Des Moines. 2020 DEMS BLAST NEW HAMPSHIRE GUN LAW VETO Via CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga:\u00a0New Hampshire's Republican governor just vetoed a new gun control measure, and Democratic presidential candidates are not happy. Sen. Cory Booker denounced New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu's veto of gun violence prevention legislation Friday. \"Our nation's patchwork of state gun laws is failing, which is why bills passed by New Hampshire Democrats represented significant progress -- not just for New Hampshire, but for the entire region,\" Booker said in a statement. \"But by vetoing commonsense solutions that would keep communities safe, Governor Sununu shamefully put the corporate gun lobby ahead of mothers and fathers and children who fear that the next tragedy will find them.\" The package of three bills were sent to the Governor's desk following mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, tragedies that collectively took the lives of 31 victims while injuring dozens more. After axing the bills, Governor Sununu released a statement, writing in part, \"Our focus as a nation must be on addressing the root causes of hate and violence. Here in New Hampshire, we have taken multiple steps to address our mental health needs and to build a more welcoming and tolerant state.\" Firing back on twitter, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke also weighed into the Granite State debate.\u00a0 \"There's 'evil' in every country, Governor,\" O'Rourke wrote. \"America is different because we're the only country with more guns than people.\" SASSE DEMANDS EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION Via CBS News digital reporter Grace Segers:\u00a0Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr Saturday afternoon demanding the Department of Justice investigate\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein's apparent suicide in jail. Sasse also called for those who allowed Epstein's death to occur under their watch to be fired.\u00a0 Epstein, who was facing federal sex trafficking charges, died Saturday in an apparent suicide, federal officials said. The Federal Bureau of Prisons said in a statement that the FBI was investigating his death. \"The Department of Justice failed, and today Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators think they might have just gotten one last sweetheart deal. Every single person in the Justice Department \u2014 from your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer \u2014 knew that this man was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn't be allowed to die with him,\" the Republican senator wrote in his letter to Barr.\u00a0 SANDERS: TRUMP DOESN'T WANT \"TO SEE PEOPLE MOWED DOWN AND KILLED\" Via CBS News digital report Camilo Montoya-Galvez:\u00a0Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders blasted President Trump for fostering \"divisiveness\" with his rhetoric, but stressed he does not believe the president wants to see people be killed in mass shootings like the recent ones in\u00a0El Paso\u00a0and\u00a0Dayton, Ohio.\u00a0 \"President Trump and nobody else wants to see people mowed down and killed, and I've never said that. He does not want to see that,\" Sanders said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the Vermont independent suggested \u2014 like many Democrats have \u2014 that Mr. Trump's fiery rhetoric emboldens people prone to carrying out violent acts because of racial animus.\u00a0 \"I think he creates a climate where we are seeing a significant increase in hate crimes in this country, hate crimes against Muslims, against Mexicans, against Jews,\" Sanders added. \"He is creating the kind of divisiveness in this nation that is the last thing that we should be doing. So he creates the climate.\" WARREN RELEASES GUN CONTROL PLAN Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak:\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0on Saturday released an ambitious plan to combat gun violence that combines executive orders and congressional action with the aim of to reducing gun deaths by 80%. The plan comes amid renewed calls for gun control one week after\u00a0mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and\u00a0Dayton, Ohio,\u00a0that left more than 30 dead.\u00a0 Warren released the plan shortly before joining the majority of other Democratic candidates at the\u00a0Iowa Gun Sense forum in Des Moines. Although Warren's Medium page lists dozens of posts about policy proposes, the plan proposed Saturday is her first full plan to tackle gun violence.\u00a0 Warren joined other candidates\u00a0earlier this week in blaming President Trump's divisive rhetoric for inspiring the El Paso shooting suspect, and on Friday, she called on Walmart to stop selling guns. But until Saturday, gun control and health care stood as the largest issues Warren hadn't addressed with a detailed plan.

            "article_content": "The Democrats running to keep President Trump from winning a second term in the White House were unmoved by his address on the mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso this weekend.\u00a0 In a statement at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump denounced white supremacy, video games and a \"culture that celebrates violence.\" He also claimed that \"mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun.\" But the 2020 Democratic field disagreed that mental illness is to blame for the shootings, arguing that the perpetrators were motivated by a white supremacist ideology and were able to carry out their assaults because of lax gun laws.\u00a0 \"White supremacy is not a mental illness. We need to call it what it is: Domestic terrorism. And we need to call out Donald Trump for amplifying these deadly ideologies,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted after the president's remarks on Monday. The American Psychological Association also said it's incorrect to blame mass shootings on mental illness, and stated that \"only a very small percentage of violent acts\" are committed by mentally ill individuals.   Other candidates also sounded similar sentiments to Warren, including Mayor\u00a0Pete Buttigieg, Sen.\u00a0Cory Booker, Mayor\u00a0Bill de Blasio, Sen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar, Rep.\u00a0Seth Moulton\u00a0and Rep.\u00a0Tim Ryan.\u00a0 Many also took issue with Mr. Trump's call to condemn white nationalism after he said Monday that \"in one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy.\" Several Democratic presidential contenders protested that the president's own rhetoric is to blame for the shootings.\u00a0 \"Let's be very clear. You use the office of the presidency to encourage and embolden white supremacy,\" former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner, tweeted. \"You use words like 'infestation' and 'invasion' to talk about human beings. We won't truly speak with one voice against hatred until your voice is no longer in the White House.\"\u00a0 Former housing secretary\u00a0Julian Castro, Sen.\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand, Gov.\u00a0Jay Inslee, Rep.\u00a0Seth Moulton, Sen. Michael Bennet and Sen. Bernie Sanders responded similarly.\u00a0 \"Mr. President: It's not about what you say. It's about what you do.  Stop your hatred, divisiveness  and anti-immigrant rhetoric.  If you truly want to be bipartisan, ask McConnell to call the Senate back into session and pass gun safety legislation that Americans are demanding,\" Sanders tweeted.\u00a0 Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who used to represent El Paso in Congress, offered the harshest criticism of the president, directly accusing Mr. Trump of promoting racism and violence. \u00a0 \"You know the shit he's been saying,\" O'Rourke told a reporter in response to a question about whether there was anything the president could do now to alleviate the damage. He's been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. Like, members of the press, what the f***k? Hold on a second. It's these questions that you know the answers to. Connect the dots about what he's doing in this country. He's not tolerating racism, he's promoting racism. He's not tolerating violence, he's inciting racism and violence in this country.\"",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg released a plan Thursday aimed at empowering black Americans through anti-racist policies across a number of sectors, including health care, education, the criminal justice system and housing. \"We have lived in the shadow of systemic racism for too long,\" Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said in a statement. \"We've seen a rise in white nationalism, an economic gap between Black and white workers that grows instead of shrinks, and worse health outcomes for Black Americans, particularly new mothers, that should make us all wonder how the richest country on earth can allow this to happen under our noses.\" In what he's calling his Douglass Plan, for abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass, Buttigieg addresses racial disparities in health care with a proposal to create an interagency National Health Equity Strategy that aims to ensure that people have access to the resources they need in their work and home environments to live healthy lives, regardless of their background. He also calls for government investment in Health Equity Zones with an emphasis on communities that have been redlined and marginalized, in order to close the gap in health disparities. \u00a0 Buttigieg proposes a $25 billion increase in funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other institutions that serve minorities. More broadly, the plan includes an increased investment of federal resources for Title I schools and gives low-income students free tuition.  Buttigieg also wants to see the number of incarcerated people in the U.S. at the federal and state levels drop by 50%. He calls for the elimination of incarceration for drug possession and would reduce sentences for other drug offenses. The plan indicates that the policy would be applied retroactively, meaning past sentences for drug offenses could be modified under the Douglass Plan. Buttigieg also proposes eliminating mandatory minimum sentences and abolishing private prisons at the federal level. Buttigieg is proposing the creation of a public trust fund to purchase abandoned houses. These properties would be made available to some residents in pilot cities, which the Department of Housing of Urban Development (HUD) would choose, based on a variety of factors, including available employment and the amount of land available. This would be done in conjunction with investments to revitalize the surrounding area.  In South Bend, Buttigieg, as mayor, implemented a housing initiative called 1,000 Houses in 1,000 Days. The initiative aimed to reduce the number of abandoned houses in the city by rehabilitating or destroying the properties. It received some criticism from South Bend residents who don't feel it improved their neighborhoods. The plan would be a \"complement\" to HR 40, which is legislation pending in Congress that would create a commission to study and recommend proposals on paying reparations to the descendants of slaves. Buttigieg has said on the campaign trail that leaders need to more intentional with their policies to replace anti-racist policies. \"I believe that when it comes to the experience of Black America, replacing racist policies with neutral policies won't get the job done,\" Buttigieg said at a fundraiser in Alexandria, Virginia in June. \"We can't have a country where people have been systematically denied every opportunity to build wealth, health, education, and then expect it to take care of itself, even we did have neutral policies, which in many cases, to this day we don't.\" Buttigieg initially released the framework of the Douglass Plan in June at a Black Economic Alliance Forum in South Carolina. Details are being released as he struggles to gain support from African American voters. According to a Quinnipiac poll after the Democratic primary debates in Miami, Buttigieg polled at zero percent among African American voters.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the Senate.",

            "article_content": "Ten Democratic presidential candidates will face questions from low-income Americans at a forum hosted by the Poor People's Campaign on Monday to discuss issues which directly affect 140 million poor and low-income people living in the United States. The presidential forum will take place on the first day of a three-day \"Poor People's Moral Action Congress\" which will include a hearing before the House Budget Committee. The ten presidential candidates attending are former Vice President Joe Biden; Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet; former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro; Rep. Eric Swalwell; Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam; Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang. Sanders and Warren in particular have focused their campaigns on combating economic inequality and the systematic disadvantages faced by low-income Americans. The Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival is a revival of the campaign started by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and stalled by his assassination in 1968. The modern iteration of the campaign was created to tackle core issues including systemic racism, economic inequality, militarism, ecological devastation and Christian nationalism. It was founded by two progressive Christian leaders, Rev. Dr. William Barber II and Rev. Dr. Liz Theoharis. \"During the 2016 Presidential primaries and campaign, there were 26 televised debates, but not a single hour was devoted to how candidates would address America's poverty,\" Barber said in a statement announcing the forum. \"Republicans talk about the economy, while Democrats speak of the middle class. Nobody talks about the poor. The Poor People's Campaign is organizing across lines created to divide us and we're forcing those in power to listen.\" The prominence of this forum demonstrates how several candidates are looking to engage Christian progressives, as a corollary to the power Christian conservatives have in influencing the Republican Party. The modern iteration of the Poor People's Movement focuses on addressing fundamental moral issues as laid out in the Bible. Barber has accused many on the Christian right of \"hijacking\" faith to advance political positions such as opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. He has argued that religious leaders should be focusing on issues which Jesus Christ explicitly promoted in the Bible instead: helping the poor and the downtrodden, and loving your neighbor as yourself. \"For too long our nation's politics has been defined by an us versus them mentality, falsely dividing us along the lines of left versus right; conservative versus liberal; Democrat versus Republican,\" Barber said in the statement announcing the event. \"Partisan language like this is too puny to address the problems we face as a nation. The solutions to our greatest challenges of systemic racism, poverty and voter suppression don't lie with the left or the right, they can be found at our shared moral center.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara that aired Sunday, March 17, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara. He was of course, fired by President Trump after he refused to resign as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. And he has a new book out, \"Doing Justice: A Prosecutor's Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law.\" Preet, good to have you here. PREET BHARARA: Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: I read the book. I want to get to some of the news of the week but first ask you actually how you ended this book because I think it resonates this week in the wake of the terror attack in New Zealand. You recount a story and a case of a- of a hate crime against someone who wanted to go out and kill Arabs after 9/11 and ended up killing some- or- and then injuring some South Asian individuals instead. Is this just a continuation of Islamophobia, of white nationalism? Is there something here or is as the president says, it's not really a broader issue at all? PREET BHARARA: Well thanks for asking about the end of the book. I- I think a lot of the world is mourning the loss of innocent lives, up to 50 now in New Zealand. And, you know, from my old vantage point as a law enforcement officer, the chief law enforcement officer federally in Manhattan, law enforcement has certain tools right? You can do surveillance. You can infiltrate organizations that propound hate and try to engage in terrorist acts. You can also hold people accountable after the fact. But one of the points I make in the book \"Doing Justice\" over and over again is laws are not enough. Law can do some things but at the end of the day if you want to quell people's hatred, you want to make people get along better, you want to have harmony, you have to have good people who are willing to- to step up to the plate and do, among other things, call out bad things when they happen. In the case that I was referring to that you mentioned in the- in the end part of the book, it was a Bangladeshi immigrant after 9/11 who was shot in the face by someone, Mark Anthony Stroman, who decided that he wanted to take revenge on behalf of I guess his race for people who had perpetrated the act of 9/11. Obviously going and randomly shooting people where they worked. And Rais Bhuiyan was not killed and decided in a way that I think is extraordinary to forgive the person who tried to kill him and tried to get him off death row and- and spare him the death penalty. He wasn't ultimately successful. But to my mind it's an- it's an inspiring story of how some people go beyond what the law even requires, beyond what the law allows, to try to have forgiveness and- and harmony go forward in the world. And I think we need a little bit more of that and a little bit less of the nasty rhetoric and a little bit less of, you know, people like the president not stepping up to the plate and calling out bad things when they're happening. MARGARET BRENNAN: Important note there in this week. But I want to turn to some of the other news that we've seen on the political and legal front. You know, we saw on Friday the special counsel again ask for the fifth time a delay in the sentencing of Rick Gates who was a- a Trump campaign deputy because it was said he's cooperating. How should people understand this? What does this mean? PREET BHARARA: Well not just cooperating but cooperating qu- in- in quote-unquote several investigations. And so you know I'm an outsider now and I don't still run the Southern District of New York and I'm not aware of what's going with various investigations that sometimes, you know, intersect with the special counsel's investigation. But I think people should view with some skepticism the notion that gets breathlessly reported every week that the Mueller investigation is coming to an end. It may be, because Andrew Weissman who is one of the top deputies in fact the top deputy with Ro- Robert Mueller, announced that he was stepping down which indicates maybe it's wrapping up.\u00a0 But then as you point out, you have this letter about Rick Gates who's cooperating in multiple investigations and they delay the sentencing which seems to indicate that he is substantially cooperating and engaging in some success for the prosecuting team. So you might expect other indictments, other work going forward. So it doesn't seem to me based on that, although I don't know, that the work of the special counsel is ending anytime soon. Unless it's the case-- the one caveat I have is, unless it's the case that the cases on which Rick Gates is cooperating are being parceled out- parceled out to other U.S. attorney's office- offices like the Southern District of New York or D.C. or somewhere else so the special counsel team can step back and have its work be done. MARGARET BRENNAN: Steve Bannon and a few other individuals have said that actually the biggest risk to the president is not from the special counsel but actually the Southern District of New York, which you know well. Do you agree with that? PREET BHARARA: Well I don't know if I- I would frame it that way. It's a sort of a polemical way to frame it. But yeah, in the sense that the SDNY, which I led for 7 \u00bd years, doesn't have the circumscription on its ambit in the same way the special counsel does. The special counsel was appointed, you know, under a particular regulation and was supposed to look at only things relating to interference in the election and potentially collusion, quote-unquote collusion with- with Russians in connection with the- with the- with the election and anything arising from it. And one of those things that ari- that arose from it was obstruction. The Southern District of New York has a lot of people in it whose mission is only to find crime, be able to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt if it's in the interests of justice to do it. And they're very aggressive and they're very fearless and they're very independent. They don't care about politics. When I was there we prosecuted Democrats and Republicans and it didn't matter who they were, you know, affiliated with. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yup. PREET BHARARA: And- and so when one of- one of the things I tried to say in the book is to explain the philosophy and the culture of the men and women of the Southern District of New York. MARGARET BRENNAN: And of course, state and federal charges and how a president's pardon could affect them are- are different too. I want to ask you as well about Paul Manafort. He was sentenced in D.C. this week. The sentence was added to. Before that in Virginia, what some would characterize as a light sentence, do you think justice is done? PREET BHARARA: It's hard to say. You know punishment is a very difficult thing to calibrate. You know whether a few months more, a few months less-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. PREET BHARARA: --is in the interest of justice, is hard to measure like- like mathematics. I agree with the people who said that the first sentence of Paul Manafort of 47 months was a bit low, given the guidelines and given the nature and seriousness of the crime and how long it went on. I think that overall the addition of 3 \u00bd years from Judge Amy Berman Jackson makes it overall a 7 \u00bd years sentence which is closer to right. I still think it's overall low, but it's hard to determine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Preet Bharara thank you for joining us. PREET BHARARA: Thanks Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: The book is \"Doing Justice.\" We'll be back in a moment.",

            "article_content": "Delhi -- The people of India, the world's biggest democracy by population, will begin voting next month to choose a new government in an election that will have major ramifications for stability in a volatile region. The nuclear-armed U.S. ally appeared to be on the brink of war just days ago as tension soared with its nuclear-armed neighbour Pakistan. \u00a0 India's general elections -- the world's largest single exercise in democracy with 900 million eligible voters among India's 1.3 billion people -- will be held in seven phases beginning on April 11, the country's Election Commission announced on Sunday. The last phase will be held on May 19, with the results to be declared on May 23.\u00a0 Voters will pick 543 members to fill the lower house of parliament, called the Lok Sabha. Any party or coalition of parties which holds a minimum of 272 seats in the house gets to form the government and name the next prime minister. The announcement of the dates officially kicked off campaigning in India, marked by colourful roadshows and public addresses by politicians which are attended by thousands of people -- some just for the free food and live music. \u00a0 \u00a0 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a second term, hoping to repeat the phenomenal performance of 2014 when his Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) alone won 282 seats. It was the first time any party had managed to win an absolute majority in three decades.\u00a0 The massive win was credited to Modi, whose slogan of \"better times will come,\" with promises of creating millions of jobs, ridding Indian politics of corruption and improving farmers' incomes resonated strongly with a population hit hard by inflation and unemployment.\u00a0 Ever since, Modi has consistently been and continues to be the face of his party, wheeled out to garner votes in every smaller election. \u00a0 Soon after the weekend announcement, Modi took to Twitter, dubbing the elections \"the festival of democracy\" and listing his achievements.  Guided by \u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\u2019, NDA seeks your blessings again. We spent the last five years fulfilling basic necessities that were left unfulfilled for 70 long years. Now, time has come to build on that and create a strong, prosperous & secure India. #PhirEkBaarModiSarkar \"The time has come,\" Modi said, to create a strong, prosperous & secure India.\"\u00a0 Last month, a suicide attack on an Indian military convoy in the disputed region of Kashmir, along India's border with Pakistan, killed more than 40 soldiers. Modi's India responded with airstrikes deep inside Pakistani territory, purportedly targeting a training camp of the banned terrorist group Jaish-e-Muhammad, which India blamed for the attack. The next day, Pakistan retaliated with airstrikes on Indian territory, prompting a dogfight in which one Indian fighter jet was shot down and its pilot captured by Pakistan. Pakistan released him the next day as a \"peace gesture,\" bringing the nuclear-armed south Asian neighbors back from the brink of full scale war. The \u00a0 two countries have fought three wars since 1947 over Kashmir -- a mountainous region divided between them but claimed in its entirety by both. \"The airstrikes on Pakistan will likely boost Modi's election prospects,\" Michael Kugelman, Deputy Director of the Asia Program and Senior Associate for South Asia at The Wilson Center, a Washington-based think-tank, told CBS News. \u00a0 Many believe that Modi, who seemed to be on the back foot after his party was dealt a series of state election losses, has shifted his campaign strategy from pushing for national development projects, to a platform focused on national security.\u00a0 \"The airstrikes have had a rally-around-the-flag effect and reinforced a tough-on-Pakistan position that can only help Modi and the BJP at the polls,\" Kugelman told CBS News.\u00a0 Respected Indian news editor Raju Narisetti, now a professor at Columbia Journalism School in New York, said Modi's campaign would likely push \"the overt and covert case that India simply needs a strong and decisive leader at the helm.\" Modi carries the image of a strong prime minister who has acted tough with the \"enemy\" next door. He has dismissed all offers of dialogue with Pakistan, \"until it stops exporting terror to India.\"  Narisetti said that while Modi's primary challenger Rahul Gandhi has been able to \"shake off\" his own devastating losses from elections last year, he and other challengers opposition leaders -- of which there are few with a high profile -- will be at a \"relative disadvantage\" to the incumbent. Political analyst Yogendra Yadav   told an Indian news channel that if it weren't for the airstrikes, Modi's party could have lost at least 100 seats in the upcoming election, but now, \"the impression is things have improved for BJP.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Modi's firm stance with Pakistan and the Kashmiri militants his government insists Pakistan allows to operate has come under criticism, but it has consolidated his nationalist, right-wing base. Before he became the prime minister, Modi would often taunt the government led by the rival party as \"weak.\" After he assumed the nation's highest office, he had to live up to expectations.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"This is a pivotal election for India-Pakistan relations and broader regional stability,\" analyst Kugelman told CBS News. \"The election result will go a long way toward determining prospects for resuming dialogue, and for the willingness of India to take a different approach to Kashmir.\"  He said that if Modi returns as prime minister, the tension between India and Pakistan could re-escalate.  To drive that point home, cross-border shelling and small arms fire has continued since the flare up in mid-February. On Monday, Pakistan accused Indian forces of firing a shell that killed a 70-year-old man visiting his daughter in Pakistan administered Kashmir. India's army blamed Pakistani troops for initiating the exchange of fire on Sunday, saying four villagers on the Indian side of Kashmir were wounded. Last week, the U.S. State Department warned Americans not to travel to Kashmir or within about six miles of the India-Pakistan border, due to the \"potential for armed conflict.\" \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Follow our latest updates here. Tuesday's original story appears below. The contentious gubernatorial elections in Kentucky and Mississippi have been commanding attention from political observers across the country, but these are not the only key races to watch Tuesday. All 140 seats in the Virginia state Senate and House are up for re-election on Tuesday. Currently, Republicans hold a majority in both chambers, but Democrats' success in flipping 15 House seats in 2017 has given the party hope that it can flip both chambers this cycle. Democrats also netted three congressional seats in 2018, indicating an increase in grassroots support for Democratic candidates in the state. Republicans' control of the state legislature is tenuous: they hold narrow majorities of 20 to 19 in the state Senate and 51 to 48 in the House of Delegates. Like other critical races across the country, the legislative elections have become somewhat nationalized, and a victory for Republicans could mean trouble for President Trump in 2020. A late October poll by Christopher Newport University of four competitive state Senate seats found that 59% of voters say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who supports Mr. Trump. The poll also found that the majority of voters in this district supported opening an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. With Democrat Ralph Northam as governor, if Democrats flip the chambers, they would control all three branches of government for the first time in 25 years. A trifecta would allow Democrats to determine where redistricting lines are drawn following the 2020 census. Democrats are looking at the 2017 results as a harbinger of a potentially successful 2019. However, old photos of Northam in blackface surfaced earlier this year, ensnaring him in a weeks-long controversy that put Virginia in the spotlight for the wrong reasons. The term-limited Northam is not on the ballot Tuesday, but he would be at the helm of whatever coalition Democrats piece together. Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax was also embroiled in a scandal over allegations of sexual assault in his past that surfaced earlier this year. Virginia was also in the national spotlight earlier this year for a state House bill that would have reduced the restrictions on conducting third-trimester abortions. Northam, who is a doctor, mangled the defense of the bill during a radio interview. Asked what would happen if a baby was born following a failed abortion, Northam said, \"The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\" Afterward, a spokesperson for Northam\u00a0released a statement\u00a0saying he was only trying to describe the \"tragic or difficult circumstances\" involved in a late-term abortion.\u00a0 The bill was voted down by a Virginia House subcommittee, but it sparked a conversation nationwide.\u00a0 Another issue on voters' minds as they head to the polls is gun violence. The issue came into focus in May when a disgruntled employee shot and killed 12 people and wounded four others in Virginia Beach. Following the shooting, Northam called a special legislative session to address gun violence in June, but nothing came of it because the Republican majorities in the state legislature adjourned without taking up a single bill.\u00a0 The elections on Tuesday have drawn some big names from both parties to get out the vote. On Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence attended a rally in Virginia Beach where he reminded voters of the importance of 2021 redistricting and promised that Republicans would \"always stand for the right to life.\" On the Democratic side, former President Obama endorsed 17 Democratic candidates for the legislature, and former Vice President Joe Biden headlined on Sunday a canvass kickoff in Sterling with former Governor Terry McAuliffe.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has also weighed in on the elections on Twitter. On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted his \"complete and total Endorsement\" to Republican Geary Higgins, who is vying for an open seat in the Virginia state Senate. He also urged Virginians to vote Republican in two tweets on Sunday. \"I hope everyone in the Great State of Virginia will get out and VOTE on Tuesday in all of the local and state elections to send a signal to D.C. that you want lower taxes, a strong Military, Border & 2nd Amendment, great healthcare, and must take care of our Vets. VOTE REPUBLICAN,\" Mr. Trump wrote. CBS News reporter covering the Pentagon.",

            "article_content": "New Delhi -- Voting began Thursday in India, the world's biggest democracy, to pick the next central government. The world's second most populous nation is a key economic and security ally of the U.S., and the outcome of the elections will have a major impact on stability in the region, and possibly on New Delhi's ties with Washington.\u00a0 The election is being watched closely by every major world power, with a focus on India's massive and growing economy, unemployment, and renewed tension with India's neighbor and fellow nuclear weapons state, Pakistan. \u00a0 Below are some of the key points that make India's exercise in democracy so interesting, and important India is predicted to surpass China as the world's most populous country within three years. A baby is born every second in India. The current population is 1.34 billion people, compared to China's 1.39 billion.\u00a0 The number of eligible voters (citizens over 18 years of age) in this election is the highest ever at 900 million. That's about four-times the number of eligible voters in the U.S., and roughly 10 percent of the world population.\u00a0  Holding an election for such a huge population is a massive challenge and is done in phases. The votes will be cast in seven rounds in this election, pertaining to different areas, with the first beginning on April 11 and the last on May 19. Results won't be declared until May 23.\u00a0 One million polling stations have been set up across the country. \u00a0 An estimated $5 billion was spent by political parties and candidates in the last Indian general elections in 2014, according to the New Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies. They said the figure would likely be more than $7 billion this year.\u00a0 The elections are for the Indian public to choose lawmakers to represent them in the lower house of India's parliament, called the Lok Sabha (\"House of the people\" in Hindi). They are elected for five-year terms.  There are 543 elected seats in the Lok Sabha. Any party that wins at least 272 seats in the house has the right to form the next national government; to nominate the prime minister and fill the cabinet.  If no one party wins that many seats, the biggest vote-getting party can try to build a coalition with other parties to form a government.  Current Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a massive mandate in the last elections in 2014. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), won 282 seats alone. The BJP's party alliances added another 54 seats, giving the governing National Democratic Alliance (NDA) a huge 336 majority in the lower house of parliament - the best election performance by any group in three decades. \u00a0 Modi, the face of his party, has campaigned hard across India to get out the vote for BJP in regional and local elections since the 2014 win, and now he's seeking hoping for second term as prime minister.\u00a0 His main challenger is Rahul Gandhi, the president of the Indian National Congress party (INC). Gandhi's party was reduced to just 44 seats in the 2014 elections, the worst performance in its history and a major blow to the party that has governed the country for 49 of its 72 years of independence from Britain.\u00a0 There have been recent state election victories for INC, however, and many analysts have predicted a possible comeback this year, even if it can't win a majority. \"India being a key ally of the U.S., Washington will be closely monitoring the polls,\" Michael Kugelman, Deputy Director of the Asia Program and Senior Associate for South Asia at The Wilson Center, a Washington-based think-tank, told CBS News. \"India shares U.S. concerns about regional terrorism and China's rise.\"\u00a0 Washington views India as a major Asian power that, as it develops, can help to offset the simultaneous rise and growing influence of China. It is a role that Kugelman believes to be stronger than relationships between individual leaders. \"The U.S.-India relationship is unlikely to be altered in a big way by the election outcome, whatever it may be,\" he said.\u00a0 But the election outcome could have a major impact on peace and stability in the region -- something the U.S. does have a vested interest in. India is going through a renewed period of military tension with Pakistan. The neighbors have fought three major wars since 1947 over Kashmir, a Himalayan mountain region divided between them but claimed by both.\u00a0 Modi has fostered a tough-on-Pakistan strongman image in recent months, and if he secures a second term it could mean continued clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbors.  The Trump administration intervened to bring the two sides back from the brink of a war in late February after they traded airstrikes, but cross-border clashes haven't stopped, and dozens of civilians have been killed since then. \u00a0 Analysts believe Modi's tough stance on Pakistan will likely help win him votes.  The opposition, however, has accused him of conducting the airstrikes for political reasons, hoping to shift the pre-election narrative from development to security. India may be a growing economic power, but it still faces massive economic and social challenges. Demand for education and healthcare services, and new jobs is ever growing. India is the world's sixth largest economy, but is tipped to overtake the U.K. next year and move into number five. The growth rate, however, has slowed over the last decade, and unemployment has been on rise.\u00a0 These issues, however, seem to have taken a back burner to security and terrorism amid the tension with Pakistan. \u00a0 \u00a0 Thanks to cheap smartphones and dirt-cheap mobile data, India is a nation online. That has made social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and messaging services like Whatsapp, popular targets for exploitation by political parties and their shadowy backers online.  Facebook alone has 300 million users in India, Whatsapp has 200 million. Fake news designed to benefit a particular party is often pushed through these mediums.\u00a0  \"There is no way India's Election Commission, with just 300 staff members, can monitor and combat disinformation on social media platforms,\" Syed Nazakat, founder of DataLEADS, a digital media company that works with the Google News Initiative to fight fake news in India, told CBS News. \"Politicians know voters on social media platforms can be influenced with targeted campaigns.\"\u00a0 Nazakat is part of the Google initiative to train thousands of journalists in India on tools to help debunk fake content online. Uttar Pradesh, with a population of over 200 million, is the most populous state in India. It sends a total of 80 members to the Lok Sabha.\u00a0 Traditionally, the party that wins the most seats in Uttar Pradesh ends up forming the central government. Modi's BJP won 71 of the 80 seats in the state in the last election in 2014.\u00a0 Along with Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra (48 seats), Bihar (38 seats), and West Bengal (41 seats) are the other key states. Together they have a combined population of half a billion people.\u00a0 Modi's BJP was polling strong in three of the four states ahead of the voting.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The Senate voted again Wednesday to terminate President Trump's declaration of national emergency at the southern border.\u00a0 Eleven Republican senators joined Democrats in voting to end the emergency declaration. The declaration, issued in February, says that the situation at the southern border is a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens U.S. national security. Mr. Trump made the declaration so that he could unilaterally build a border wall despite the fact that Congress did not appropriate the funds for him to do so. Under the declaration, President Trump diverted funding from congressionally approved military construction projects to pay for border barriers. \u00a0 The administration has so far reprogrammed about $6.1 billion in funding for the construction of border barriers. In March, the Senate voted to reject the emergency declaration, but the president promptly\u00a0vetoed\u00a0the measure and instructed the Department of Defense to divert funds for a border wall. The House of Representatives\u00a0failed to override the veto.\u00a0\u00a0 The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is targeting Republican incumbents who voted against terminating the emergency declaration that diverts money from defense projects in their states. The DSCC has released two new ads against Arizona Sen. Martha McSally and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who are facing re-election in 2020. Both states stand to lose millions in expenditures due to the diversion of funds, according to estimates from the Department of Defense. \u00a0 At the time of the initial vote, Congress did not know which defense projects would be affected. Earlier this month, the Department of Defense released a list of projects potentially impacted and several of the projects are in states Democrats are targeting in their effort to flip the Senate. Editorial boards in\u00a0Texas\u00a0and\u00a0North Carolina\u00a0have criticized the president's decision to take funds for defense projects in their states to build a border wall. Senate Majority Leader Republican Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for their refusal to fund border security in a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday morning. \"Washington Democrats decided that giving this very real crisis the resources it required might anger the far left which wants them to oppose President Trump at any costs,\" McConnell said. DSCC Spokesperson Stewart Boss told CBS News in a statement, \"Republican Senators paved the way for this harmful raid on critical military construction funding, and they just knowingly voted again to uphold this bogus emergency declaration and allow the Trump administration to keep diverting money away from their own states.\"\u00a0 The new digital ads will run on Facebook and target McSally, Tillis, and McConnell as well as Senators John Cornyn of Texas, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Cory Gardner of Colorado.

            "article_content": "Nine congressional representatives serve the districts that line the 2,000-mile southern border. They are men, women, freshman politicians and Washington veterans. The Democrats among them span liberal ideologies, while one of them is a Republican.  But they all have one thing in common: each is against President Donald Trump's border wall. Last week, the House of Representatives passed a multi-bill package that provided funding for federal agencies and reinstated Department of Homeland Security appropriations without offering any new border wall funding. All nine of the politicians serving in districts along the border voted in favor of the bills, which were an effective rebuke of the Trump administration's request for $5.7 billion in border wall funding. \"It's a 4th-century solution to a 21st century problem,\" said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Democrat and one of the lawmakers along the southern border who voted against funding the wall. Gonzalez doesn't oppose border security. He said, \"Nobody wants stronger border control than me.\" But he's against adding to the existing border wall because he doesn't \"think it brings real border security and it comes at a major cost to taxpayers,\" the lawmaker said Tuesday in a telephone interview with CBS News. During a private dinner with Mr. Trump last year, the congressman suggested a \"virtual border wall,\" one that would use technology and existing military surveillance equipment currently not in use. But Mr. Trump wasn't interested in non-physical alternatives, Gonzalez said. \"At the time I thought we were going to be able to have a reasonable conversation,\" Gonzalez said. \"I had no idea it was going to get this crazy.\" Within Gonzalez's district is McAllen, a Texas border town that Mr. Trump plans to visit during his trip to the border this week. Unlike how areas along the border have been described by other politicians, Gonzalez called McAllen one of the safest towns in the country and said it is experiencing a 33-year low in crime rates. He rejects the idea that there is a crisis at the border. \"When people talk about violence streaming across the border, it's just nonsense,\" Gonzalez said. Rep. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican who represents more of the southern border than any other member of Congress, was one of a handful of Republicans to side with Democrats last week on the funding bill.\u00a0 Hurd, who is the only black Republican in the 116th House of Representatives, won a second term in Congress during the midterms while campaigning against the wall, narrowly winning his re-election. Political strategists have said that Mr. Trump's last-minute, hardline rhetoric around what he called the \"border crisis\" nearly cost Hurd his seat in Congress.\u00a0 Prior to the government shutdown, Hurd \u2014 a former undercover CIA agent \u2014 had introduced another idea: legislation for a \"smart border wall,\" a technology-focused initiative that he claimed would cost less than $1 billion. Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona whose district shares a border with Mexico, also opposed funding the wall, calling it \"a fantasy\" and \"not the solution.\" \"This is a terrible, terrible mistake that Trump is making,\" said Grijalva, a first-generation Mexican-American whose father came to the U.S. under the 1940s-era Bracero temporary worker program. \"It would be devastating to my district.\" Grijalva questioned Mr. Trump's description of a \"crisis\" on the border, saying that if anything, the situation on the border was a \"manufactured crisis.\" \"I think he is wrong politically, and in terms of security, absolutely wrong,\" Grijalva said. Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that there are nine Congressional districts along the United States border with Mexico. A previous version of this story said there were eight.",

            "article_content": "Tijuana, Mexico -- U.S. authorities fired tear gas into Mexico during the first hours of the new year to repel about 150 migrants who tried to breach the border fence in Tijuana. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement later Tuesday that the gas was used to target rock throwers apart from the migrants who were trying to cross. \"No agents witnessed any of the migrants at the fence line, including children, experiencing effects of the chemical agents, which were targeted at the rock throwers further away,\" the statement said. An Associated Press photographer saw at least three volleys of gas launched onto the Mexican side of the border near Tijuana's beach that affected the migrants, including women and children, as well as journalists. The AP saw rocks thrown only after U.S. agents fired the tear gas. The agency said agents saw \"toddler sized children\" being passed over concertina wire with difficulty. It said its agents could not assist the children because of the rocks being thrown. Agents responded with smoke, pepper spray and tear gas, it said. The AP journalist also saw plastic pellets fired by U.S. agents. \"Agents observed several individuals throwing rocks who appeared to have prepared themselves for the assault by applying lotion to their faces to counter the effects of chemical munitions,\" Rodney Scott, chief patrol agent of the U.S. Border Patrol's San Diego sector, said in\u00a0a statement posted on Instagram. \"Several arrests were made, all individuals from central America. No injuries were sustained by either the agents or individuals arrested.\" The agency said 25 migrants were detained while others crawled back into Mexico through a hole under the fence. Customs and Border Protection said that under its use of force policy the incident would be reviewed by its Office of Professional Responsibility. Migrants who spoke with AP said they arrived in Tijuana last month with the caravan from Honduras. The caravan, which left Honduras in mid-October, grew to more than 6,000 members during its month-and-a-half trek north. It has been a constant target of President Donald Trump, who referred to it frequently in the run-up to U.S. mid-term elections in November. Many of the migrants are waiting in Tijuana for a chance to apply for asylum in the U.S., but there was a backlog before the caravan's arrival and the wait is expected to be many months. Others have found jobs in Mexico and tried to settle there. In a previous incident, U.S. agents launched tear gas across the border after some migrants tried to breach the border following a peaceful march in Tijuana on Nov. 26. Hundreds of migrants who were downwind of the gas were affected. Mr. Trump is currently locked in a fight with congressional Democrats over funding for the border wall that he wants to build. The stalemate has led to a partial government shutdown. Mr. Trump invited congressional leaders of both parties to the White House on Wednesday for a \"briefing\" on border security, according to a congressional source.\u00a0 Last week, Mr. Trump threatened to close the southern border \"entirely\" if he does not get the funding he needs for his border wall, saying that it would be a \"profit-making operation\" to do so.",

            "article_content": "A North Carolina state senator who sponsored the state's controversial anti-transgender \"bathroom bill\" has won the Republican primary for the 9th Congressional seat. The North Carolina Board of Elections in January called for a new election after a months-long investigation into alleged absentee ballot fraud.   Sen. Dan Bishop topped nine other GOP candidates seeking the 9th Congressional District nomination. The Charlotte attorney raised the most in campaign contributions, seeded with $250,000 from his personal accounts.  In 2016, he sponsored House Bill 2, the law that voided a Charlotte ordinance expanding LGBT rights and prevented similar anti-discrimination rules anywhere else in the state. HB2 was nicknamed the \"bathroom bill\" because it also directed transgender people to use public bathrooms and showers that matched their birth sex. The measure made waves nationally and prompted boycotts by entertainers, governments and some businesses thinking about moving jobs to North Carolina.  Now, with his primary win, Bishop faces Democrat Dan McCready in the Sept 10 general election. McCready was unopposed.\u00a0 The special primary and general elections were required after the state elections board in February determined last year's contest tainted when Republican Mark Harris used a political operative who collected mail-in ballots. Harris, who narrowly led after November's votes were counted, opted not to run again.\u00a0 With conflict between President Trump and Washington Democrats heating up after the investigation into Russian support for the president's 2016 campaign, the 9th District race is expected to serve as a barometer of political tides.  Bishop thanked his supporters Tuesday night and accused Democrats of advocating ideas outside the mainstream.  \"People are astonished and amazed and dismayed at what they see coming out of Washington these days from liberal crazy clowns. Socialism. Open borders. Infanticide. 90% tax rates. Having prison inmates vote. It goes on and on,\" Bishop said. \"And of course, most of all, an incessant drive to impeach the president.\"  The election should draw a heavy infusion of political cash over the next four months, foreshadowed by spending in this primary. The political action committee for the anti-tax Club for Growth endorsed Bishop and spent more than $135,000 attacking top rivals Stony Rushing and Leigh Brown. The National Association of Realtors' PAC spent more than $1 million to benefit Brown.  McCready had almost $1.6 million in cash on hand as of May 2, according to Federal Election Commission reports, and after two years of campaigning has built up his name recognition. Despite that, he'll be swimming upstream in a congressional district that has been in GOP hands since 1963 and which Trump won by 12 percentage points in 2016.  A Bishop television ad during the primary focused on his support for Trump's border wall proposal and labeled Democrats \"crazy liberal clowns.\"  Restaurant owner Julie Pressley, 47, of Indian Trail, stopped into her business Tuesday to check on preparations for Rushing's election-night party, then headed to the polls to vote for the candidate she said she's known since high school. Rushing and Pressley's husband serve together on the Union County commission, its executive board. Pressley said that's allowed her to know that Rushing recognizes he represents people who don't support him as much as those who do.  \"We've seen what he stands for as far as the people, what's best for all the people, not just certain kinds. Whether it be rich people, poor people, whatever, he cares greatly,\" said Pressley, who shares Rushing's low-tax, anti-abortion values. \"He's very concerned about everybody, whether they like him or not. He wants to do what's best for 'em.\"  Mitchell Eudy, 60, of Monroe, said he voted for Dan Bishop in part because he dislikes Rushing. A couple of friends who know Bishop recommended him, said Eudy, who sees the candidate as the most likely to beat McCready.  \"I think he will have a broader appeal for the entire population of the 9th District,\" Eudy said.  The district stretches from suburban Charlotte to suburban Fayetteville along the South Carolina border.  The GOP's brand has suffered in the wake of the much-publicized investigation into Harris's campaign, followed last month by federal charges accusing the state party's chairman of working with a big-money donor to try bribing North Carolina's top insurance regulator.  \"Folks actually do bring this up,\" candidate Matthrew Ridenhour, a former county commissioner from Charlotte, said during a debate last week. \"What's going on with the GOP? What happened to your GOP chairman? What's going on there with these donors?  Are you involved in that? Did you take any money from that donor? I did not. But that's a question that comes up often.\"",

            "article_content": "Delhi -- There were celebrations in India on Friday as Pakistan released fighter pilot Abhinandan Varthaman. He was captured by Pakistan's military on Wednesday morning after his fighter jet was shot down in a dogfight along the two nations' disputed border. On Thursday, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that his country would release the Indian pilot as a \"peace gesture\" in a bid to de-escalate soaring tension after days of cross-border military action between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.\u00a0 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Friday: Welcome Home Wing Commander Abhinandan!The nation is proud of your exemplary courage.Our armed forces are an inspiration for 130 crore Indians.Vande Mataram! Pakistan's government sought to claim the moral high ground in the latest flare-up of the decades-old dispute, sending a tweet confirming Varthaman's handover, with the hashtag, #PakistanLeadsWithPeace. \u00a0 Pakistan hands over captured Indian Pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman to Indian authorities at Wagah Border, Lahore as a Peace Gesture.#PakistanLeadsWithPeace #GivePeaceAChance Indian Air Force officials at the border confirmed to reporters that the pilot was back in their care and that he would be taken immediately for a detailed medical check-up, which is mandated because he had to eject from his plane.\u00a0 \"We are happy to have him back,\" the Air Force officer said at the border, without taking any questions. People turned out in large numbers early Friday morning at the Wagah-Attari border crossing, about 300 miles from New Delhi, where Pakistan handed the pilot over to India. Hundreds could be seen waving Indian flags and beating drums to welcome Varthaman, who has been celebrated as a hero.\u00a0 To avoid an uncontrollable crowd and media frenzy, police eventually asked people to leave the border crossing. The handover was delayed for hours on Friday without explanation from either side, but Varthaman finally crossed the border just after 9 p.m. local time (10:30 a.m. Eastern). \u00a0 India seemed wary of turning the pilot's homecoming into a spectacle. There is significant military protocol that has to be followed now that the pilot has been returned from captivity; including the medical check and full debriefing by senior officers.  Indian Air Force personnel were at the border and were to fly Vardhaman to New Delhi. Indian media reports said India wanted to send a special plane to bring back the 35-year-old wing commander, but Pakistan turned down the request.\u00a0 \u00a0 Modi spoke for the first time about the captured pilot on Friday. At an election rally in Tamil Nadu, the pilot's home state, Modi said, \"Every Indian is proud that brave Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman is from Tamil Nadu.\" But while the tension has eased to some degree, with many foreign nations including the U.S. stepping in to urge calm and push for dialogue, the two long-time foes' military forces have continued to exchange fire, mostly shelling, along the disputed border in the Kashmir region. Seven civilians were injured on the Indian-controlled side of Kashmir, in the Uri border area, by Pakistani firing over night, Indian officials said. The shelling continued Friday afternoon in the Nowshera sector, also along the Kashmir border.\u00a0 When Pakistan's Khan announced on Thursday that the pilot would be returned, he did so with a warning to Modi: \"I want to say it to India today: Don't take this any further, Pakistan will be forced to retaliate,\" Khan said. \"I hope the international community will play its part to ensure the situation does not escalate beyond this.\"\u00a0 Speaking earlier on Thursday, Modi spoke in strong words against Pakistan, urging his nation to \"stand like a wall\" against an enemy he said \"supports terror.\"\u00a0 \"India will fight as one, India will win as one,\" Modi said.\u00a0 While the government tried to keep a relatively tight lid on the actual handover at the border on Friday, Indians enthusiastically celebrated their Air Force pilot's release online, with the #WelcomeHomeAbhinandan hashtag spreading fast across social media. He has been the top Twitter trend in India since Thursday afternoon, when Pakistan announced his imminent release.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate opponents of President Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the Mexican border have moved very close to having enough votes to prevail, and one Republican suggested the president risks a rebuff by the GOP-led chamber if he doesn't change course. Mr. Trump's move would \"turn a border crisis into a constitutional crisis,\" veteran Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander said on the Senate floor Thursday. But he stopped just short of saying he'd support a resolution blocking the president's move. Had Alexander pledged his vote, it would probably be enough for the Senate to pass a measure repealing the emergency declaration. Speaking later to reporters, Tennessee's Alexander warned what might happen if Mr. Trump doesn't settle for using other money he can access without declaring an emergency. \"He can build a wall and avoid a dangerous precedent and I hope he'll do that,\" Alexander said. \"So that would change the voting situation if he would agree to do that.\" The Democratic-led House House passes resolution aimed at blocking Trump's national emergency declaration, which he declared to circumvent Congress and funnel billions of extra dollars to erecting his proposed wall. The president has promised to veto the effort to thwart him, and Congress seems all but certain to lack the two-thirds majorities in each chamber that would be needed to override his veto. But the showdown puts GOP lawmakers in a ticklish spot that party leaders are hoping to ease. Republicans say a Senate vote is likely in two weeks, but exactly what the Senate will vote on remains unclear. Several Republicans said that behind closed doors, they were considering several options for alternative language. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, was among those suggesting provisions making it harder for future presidents to divert federal dollars to projects of their choosing by declaring emergencies. \"I wouldn't be surprised if some changes are made,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. While the wall elicits wide public opposition, Mr. Trump remains wildly popular with hard-right voters and GOP lawmakers cross him at their peril. Mr. Trump warned Republicans anew against challenging him. \"I really think that Republicans that vote against border security and the wall, I think you know, I've been OK at predicting things, I think they put themselves at great jeopardy,\" the president said in an interview with Fox News Channel's \"Hannity.\" While congressional Republicans are reluctant to confront Mr. Trump, many say his move tramples Congress' constitutional power to control spending. They say it would set a precedent for future Democratic presidents to declare emergencies for their own purposes, and they worry he would siphon money to barrier construction from home-state projects. Alexander, a three-term senator who plans to retire in 2021, has no re-election worries. \"I support what the president wants to do on border security, but not the way he has been advised to do it,\" said Alexander, 78. \"It is unnecessary and unwise to turn a border crisis into a constitutional crisis about separation of powers.\" Presidents have declared 58 national emergencies under a 1976 law. But never has one declared an emergency after Congress had explicitly denied the money in question, Alexander said. GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina have said they will vote to derail the emergency declaration. Just four Republicans would be needed to send the measure to Trump for his promised veto, assuming that all 47 Democrats and their independent allies vote as expected to confront the president. By law, the resolution cannot be filibustered and would only need a majority to pass the Senate, usually 51 votes. Congress has voted to limit spending for barriers to just under $1.4 billion. Mr. Trump featured the wall as a central plank of his presidential campaign and repeatedly said Mexico would pay for it, which hasn't happened. Mr. Trump has said he needs additional barriers to halt drugs, human traffickers and unauthorized immigrants from slipping into the U.S. Opponents say there is no crisis. The emergency declaration would let Trump divert $3.6 billion from military construction to erect more border barriers. He's invoking other authorities to transfer an additional $3.1 billion to construction. Lawsuits have been filed aimed at derailing the declaration, which could at least prevent Mr. Trump from getting the extra money for months or more. Meanwhile, Collins and three other moderate senators introduced their own resolution blocking the emergency. The proposal is identical to the one-sentence, House-approved measure. The new legislation lets senators put their stamp on congressional opposition to Mr. Trump's move. The other sponsors are Sens. Tom Udall, D-N.M., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. Only Murkowski doesn't face re-election next year.",

            "article_content": "Jerusalem -- A tense quiet has taken hold after a night of heavy fire as Israeli aircraft bombed targets across the Gaza Strip and Gaza militants fired rockets into Israel. Schools in southern Israel were shuttered on Tuesday following the violence that erupted just two weeks ahead of Israeli elections. The Israeli military imposed restrictions on public gatherings near the Gaza border after dozens of rockets were fired toward communities in the area, including one that struck a house in the town of Sderot. The violence escalated quickly on Monday after Israel accused Palestinian Hamas militants of firing a rocket that hit a home near Tel Aviv, deep inside Israeli territory. In retaliation the Israeli air force pounded militant sites of Gaza's Hamas rulers and the smaller Islamic Jihad group. The targets included a multistory building in Gaza City that Israel said had served as a Hamas military intelligence headquarters and the office of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. The airstrike was so powerful it sent debris flying onto the roof of The Associated Press bureau on the 11th floor of a nearby high-rise. Gaza's Health Ministry said seven Palestinians were wounded in the airstrikes. CBS News correspondent Seth Doane was in the Israeli town of Sderot, where some of the rockets from Gaza landed. Israel's military has said at least 60 rockets were fired from Gaza overnight. Doane said people on both sides of the border were still on high alert Tuesday with schools closed, bomb shelters open and troop reinforcements being sent toward the Gaza-Israel border. On the way to Sderot, Doane and his team saw Israeli military convoys on the road, and armored vehicles massing in fields.\u00a0 The attack prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut short a visit to Washington and return home. He promised a tough response, setting the stage for perhaps the most serious conflict since a 50-day war in 2014. The increased hostilities come at a time when both Netanyahu and his Hamas foes are in desperate situations, with little incentive to de-escalate quickly. Netanyahu is in a tight race for re-election against former army chief Benny Gantz. The prime minister is facing tough criticism from political rivals, including in his own right-wing political camp, who accuse him of being too soft on Hamas. His visit to Washington lent him a boost, however, with President Donald Trump unilaterally recognizing the disputed and strategic Golan Heights, seized by Israel from neighboring Syria in 1967, as Israeli territory. Mr. Trump's move, which follows the trajectory set by his administration with the unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital last year, ends decades of U.S. Middle East policy refusing to formally recognize Israel's land-grab.\u00a0 The U.N. Security Council in a December 1981 resolution called Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights \"null and void and without international legal effect,\" and on Monday the U.N. said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres continued to adhere to council resolutions. \u00a0 Syria called the move a \"blatant aggression\" on its sovereignty, and Lebanon, which Secretary of State Mike Pence visited over the past weekend, said the Golan Heights was \"Syrian Arab\" territory and that \"no country can falsify history by transferring\" land from one country to another. Even U.S. allies Canada and Turkey expressed opposition.\u00a0 Hamas, meanwhile, is under growing pressure domestically because of its failure to get Israel and Egypt to ease their Gaza border blockade, imposed after the 2007 Hamas takeover.\u00a0 Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, warned Israel against heavy retaliation. He said the Palestinian people \"will not surrender\" and its militant factions \"will deter the enemy if it exceeds the red lines.\" In Beirut, the powerful Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, met Monday with a senior Hamas delegation. Hezbollah said they discussed the Gaza situation and \"Israeli aggression.\" Hamas is facing perhaps its toughest domestic test since seizing control of Gaza from the rival Palestinian Authority 12 years ago. The Israel-Egyptian blockade, imposed to weaken Hamas, combined with sanctions by the Palestinian Authority and mismanagement by the Hamas government, have fueled an economic crisis that has left Gaza with an unemployment rate above 50 percent. Hamas has been leading weekly protests along the Israeli border for the past year in hopes of easing the blockade, but the demonstrations, in which some 190 people have been killed by Israeli fire, have done little to improve conditions. Last week, hundreds of Gazans protested the dire conditions, a rare expression of public discontent against the authoritarian government. Hamas responded with a violent crackdown, beating and arresting dozens of demonstrators and drawing rare public criticism. The Monday rocket attack, which caught Israel off guard, may have been an attempt by Hamas to divert attention from its growing domestic woes. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars. Although neither side appears to have an interest in another one, fighting could easily spin out of control. The 2014 conflict lasted 50 days and ended with over 2,000 Palestinian deaths, including hundreds of civilians, and 73 killed on the Israeli side. Netanyahu faces the difficult task of delivering a tough blow to Hamas while avoiding protracted fighting that could work against him on election day. Monday's attack came 10 days after rockets were fired from Gaza toward Israel's densely populated commercial capital of Tel Aviv, and the Israeli military struck back. Gaza's Hamas leaders said the rocket was fired accidentally and the fighting quickly subsided.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Mexico made it clear it won't pay for the border wall promised by President Donald Trump during the 2016 election campaign. Yet Mr. Trump keeps repeating the notion in various forms, most recently tying it to his newly renegotiated trade agreement with Mexico. The latest utterance came in his speech from the Oval Office last night. \"The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico,\" Mr. Trump said.  Fact check: False. The new trade agreement reached last year, called the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, or USMCA, would replace the existing North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA, which has been in effect since the early 1990s. NAFTA eliminated most tariffs between the three signatories, with a few exceptions.  USMCA, which does little to change those eliminations, isn't yet in effect. That's because Congress still needs to ratify the deal (as do legislative bodies in Mexico and Canada).  In the U.S., USMCA ratification is far from certain and isn't likely to be taken up soon, given Democrats now control the House and the government remains partially shut down. Even if the new trade deal is enacted, it's not clear how funds in the U.S. Treasury would be earmarked to build Mr. Trump's wall.  The president has previously implied that tariffs paid on Mexican imports could be used to bolster U.S. coffers and, in turn, be eventually allocated to pay for wall construction. That's also problematic: Congress drafts budgets and must approve any government spending. \"Donald Trump keeps repeating the ludicrous claim that somehow the revised NAFTA will fund his wall even though it remains unclear if the deal will be enacted,\" Lori Wallach, director of trade policy for advocacy group Public Citizen, said in a statement. \"And if it is, the text does not include border wall funding directly nor would it generate new government revenue indirectly given it cuts the very few remaining tariffs, not raises them.\" Tariffs are taxes paid at the border to the government in order to import goods and services into the U.S. for sale inside the country. Any taxes collected into the U.S. Treasury that could be allocated for wall construction would still have to be approved by Congress, which at the moment remains at an impasse with Mr. Trump on that very topic. It's why the government is partially shut down. Importers\u00a0like Ford or Walmart pay these duties. They either swallow the cost or pass it along to consumers. That means it's often ordinary Americans who foot the bill for tariffs. Mr. Trump's trade levies are designed to make certain goods more expensive for U.S. consumers, who in turn are likely to seek out lower-cost items made in the U.S. or from countries that aren't facing the higher tariffs.\u00a0 For U.S. manufacturers, purchases are often raw materials, like steel, or finished and semi-finished parts, like seats for automobiles. The U.S. also imports food and commodities like grain and meat. Take steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump's White House imposed tariffs\u00a0on imported steel and aluminum\u00a0last year. Because prices for imported metals are now higher, domestic producers have also been able to raise prices. And it's those increases that can get passed onto consumers for the finished goods. When it comes to the USMCA, Mexico generally doesn't pay taxes on goods imported into the U.S. If there are tariffs, U.S. companies pay them. Higher tariffs can force a company to pass on that extra cost to the consumer.\u00a0 Another theory is that the U.S. economy will be so good under the new agreement that the U.S. Treasury's coffers will swell, providing enough funds to pay the billions for Mr. Trump's wall. That's a lot of ifs, given the current impasse, experts have noted.\u00a0 Bottom line: No matter how many times Mr. Trump says it, Mexico probably isn't paying for the wall, directly or indirectly, anytime soon. As things now stand, U.S. taxpayers would wind up with the bill.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump signed off Friday on nearly $1.4 trillion in spending that will keep the government funded through September 30. The bill's passage allows both parties to dodge the possibility of a shutdown ahead of what's expected to be a contentious election season. White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said Mr. Trump signed the legislation aboard Air Force One as he traveled to his Mar-a-Lago resort, where he will be celebrating Christmas and New Year's. The spending measures, which will add roughly $400 billion to the deficit over 10 years, include money for the president's U.S.-Mexico border fence, pay raises for military and civilian federal workers, and federal funding for election security grants. The massive spending measures were made public earlier this week and headed off a repeat of last year's end-of-the-year impasse that led to a 35-day partial government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history. That showdown stemmed from Mr. Trump's demand that Congress sign off on nearly $6 billion in funding for the border wall. Hundreds of thousands of government workers were furloughed or forced to work without pay during the shutdown. Trump skipped his holiday vacation and remained in Washington through the impasse.",

            "article_content": "On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click\u00a0here\u00a0to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sunday, October 20th. I am Margaret Brennan in the nation's capital. And this is FACE THE NATION.\u00a0With the White House engulfed by controversy, President Trump faces scrutiny of his administration strategy or lack thereof.\u00a0In Syria, a shaky cease-fire expires on Tuesday.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I view the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be, for the United States, strategically brilliant. Our soldiers are out of there. Our soldiers are totally safe.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President's decision to withdraw U.S. troops has triggered concerns about declining U.S. influence and has left key allies questioning his judgment.\u00a0SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: This is a defining moment of Trump's presidency. If we abandon the Kurds, it will be to our shame and to our national security detriment and Trump will own the reemergence of ISIS.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Washington, the President's chief of staff handed Democrats new ammunition in their impeachment investigation.\u00a0JONATHAN KARL: To be clear, what you just described is a quid pro quo. It is-- funding will not flow unless the investigation into the-- into the Democratic server happens as well.\u00a0MICK MULVANEY: We do-- we do that all the time with foreign policy. And I have news for everybody: Get over it.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Our guests, two members of the House Intelligence Committee. Connecticut Democrat Jim Himes and Texas Republican Will Hurd.\u00a0Plus, as U.S. troops continue to leave Syria, a conversation with the man who led them, General Tony Thomas, in his first interview since retiring from the job.\u00a0All that, and political analysis of the week up next on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It was another chaotic week as we bounce between breaking news on the fighting in Syria and Democrats' impeachment investigation in Washington.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Chaos in Syria. As adversaries advance faster than the U.S. could retreat, American troops took the extraordinary action of bombing their own base to keep supplies out of enemy hands. Vice President Pence led an emergency mission to ask Turkey to pause its invasion.\u00a0MIKE PENCE (Thursday): Turkey and the United States of America have agreed to a cease-fire in Syria.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Turkey agreed to a five-day pause in exchange for a U.S. promise to lift sanctions. President Erdogan won another key concession--America's Kurdish allies must flee northern Syria.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Thursday): Without spilling a drop of American blood, not one drop of American blood, sometimes you have to let them fight. Like two kids in a lot, you got to let them fight and then you pull them apart.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: A Wednesday White House meeting on Syria brought Democratic leaders face to face with President Trump for the first time since the impeachment probe began. It didn't go smoothly. Democrats walked out claiming the President insulted the speaker.\u00a0STENY HOYER (Wednesday): We were offended deeply by his treatment of the speaker of the House of Representatives.\u00a0CHUCK SCHUMER (Wednesday): Go ahead.\u00a0NANCY PELOSI (Wednesday): What we witnessed on the part of the President was a meltdown. Sad to say.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Earlier that day Republicans and Democrats had overwhelmingly voted to rebuke the President for his decision to withdraw troops. In a rare move, some Senate Republicans also spoke out.\u00a0MITCH MCCONNELL (Wednesday): Many of us have been arguing that this was a mistake, it shouldn't have been done.\u00a0MITT ROMNEY (Thursday): What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Meanwhile, the impeachment inquiry intensified. Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official told investigators that she had notified White House lawyers in July after she had heard Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the EU, offer Ukrainian officials a meeting between their president and Mister Trump if an investigation was opened into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that Joe Biden's son, Hunter, worked for. John Bolton, the President's national security advisor, likened it to a \"drug deal\" and said he wanted \"no part\" of it. But Ambassador Sondland testified that no one ever \"\u2026raised\u2026any concerns.\" And said that it was the President who had directed him to work with personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on the project. The President's chief of staff was also implicated and on Thursday appeared to admit to reporters that he held up military aid for Ukraine, in part, because President Trump wanted the country to investigate a conspiracy theory about Democrats in 2016 election.\u00a0MICK MULVANEY (Thursday): The corruption related to the DNC server, absolutely. No question about that. But that's it. And that's why we held up the money. Now there was a report--\u00a0JONATHAN KARL (Thursday): So-- so-- so-- so the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he wanted--\u00a0MICK MULVANEY: It was on--\u00a0JONATHAN KARL: --to withhold funding to Ukraine?\u00a0MICK MULVANEY: The-- the look back to what happened in 2016--\u00a0JONATHAN KARL: The investigation into Democrats.\u00a0MICK MULVANEY: --certainly was-- was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate.\u00a0JONATHAN KARL: Withholding-- withholding the funding?\u00a0MICK MULVANEY: Yeah. Which-- which ultimately, then, flowed.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Later in the day, Mulvaney released a statement trying to walk back what he had just said.\u00a0We begin this morning with a top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes, who joins us from Stamford. Congressman, we just laid out what has developed over the course of the week. When will Democrats have heard enough to actually move forward with drafting articles of impeachment?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut/Intelligence Committee/@jahimes): Yeah. That's-- that's a great question, Margaret. It's-- It's a little hard to answer because, of course, every single day we're presented with sort of jaw dropping new information. I don't think any of us anticipated that the chief of staff would-- would basically confirm that military aid was being held up in favor of a crackpot theory that somehow the DNC server made its way to Ukraine. I-- it's almost embarrassing to see the words White House behind the chief of staff peddling a completely rebuked crazy theory. But-- but, I guess, the best I can do to answer your question is, Margaret, we have a little bit more work to do to understand exactly who was involved in stopping that military aid from flowing and what they knew. We have a little bit more work to do in understanding who exactly gave the order to fire Ambassador Yovanovitch, a profoundly well-respected diplomat. Presumably, the secretary of state signed off on that and on what basis did he do so? And then, lastly, Margaret, I would say at the very center of this whole ugly episode of the use of military aid of a White House meeting in an effort to get an investigation of Joe Biden and to get Ukraine to interfere in our election is Rudy Giuliani and Rudy Giuliani has refused to appear before the committee. But he is at the very core of this question and so I-- in my opinion, I don't speak for the chairman--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you proceed without him?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, I think we can. Again, one of the-- one of the shocking things about this investigation is that all of the facts that are out there that support this notion that military aid was withheld that a White House meeting was withheld-- you know, it comes from the administration. It comes from the chief of staff. It comes from the transcript. So we have a lot of what we need. But Rudy Giuliani running around, meeting with heads of state on behalf of the President's political interests is a profoundly shocking and important thing for us to understand. So while I guess we could sort of piece together exactly what happened based on what the administration has disclosed, I really think it's important to talk to Rudy Giuliani.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So in terms of what's happening behind closed doors, Republicans argue that this process is overly secretive and there was a letter sent to your committee on Friday by nine Republicans who accuse Chairman Schiff of knowingly withholding committee documents from the minority. Why is that happening?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, it-- first of all, it's not happening. As a Democrat on the committee, I will tell you that we are getting witnesses canceled at the last minute. We are getting documents at ten o'clock the night before a-- a witness comes in. And so, as a Democrat, I often don't see documents until well after I would like to. But, Margaret, bigger picture here, what is happening-- and you're going to talk to my friend and colleague Will Hurd shortly--what is happening is that there is no way for the Republicans to defend the actions of the President here. What the Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said-- there is no way for them to defend that behavior. So as a result what they are doing is that they are-- they are attacking the process. Now let me-- let me just spend a second on that process. The previous impeachment inquiries of Nixon and of Clinton, the Congress was handed a fully done investigation in the case of Clinton by a special prosecutor Starr. In the case of Nixon, by a--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: --by a different special prosecutor. We are doing that now and an investigation doesn't happen in the light of day, but I will tell you that there will be open hearings. Every transcript after--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: --they are scrubbed through classified information will be released publicly and this will ultimately be all out there for the American people to see. And what the American people will see is that there is not one word of testimony, written or spoken, which contradicts the notion that the President used the assets of the United States--military aid, a White House meeting--to advance his political interests of getting Ukraine to meddle in the next-- in the upcoming presidential election.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When is that first public hearing and when will those documents be made public?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, again, you know, when you're shocked by the chief of staff basically saying that there was a prid-- quid pro quo, it's a little hard to make any predictions whatsoever about what the timing will be. My belief is, Margaret, and again, you know, shocking things happen every single day--my belief is that the speaker of the House would like to get this wrapped up by the end of the year. I think that's probably possible.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I think that having cooperation from the White House, which maintains that everything is perfect and so why not cooperate. In my-- in my mind having cooperation would allow it to move much faster. But I think in any event the speaker is going to try really hard to get this wrapped up by the end of the year.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: As we laid out there were some contradictions in testimonies this week. Fiona Hill testified. She confronted Ambassador Sondland when he was discussing that offer of a meeting between the two leaders in exchange for opening an investigation. This morning Mick Mulvaney said that John Bolton who, according to the Hill, objected--never actually did raise a red flag. Sondland says no one ever objected. How do you-- how do you reconcile that without calling John Bolton and the NSC lawyer to testify themselves?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yeah. Well, you know, there-- there-- there have been some inconsistencies and I can't get into the details of the testimony. But, you know, it will surprise nobody to know that when a witness comes before the Congress, they recount the story in the way that makes them look the best. And so there will always be some tension around the facts. But-- but, again, we-- we-- we shouldn't get lost on the details of a particular meeting. The fact is, and we know this from any number of opening statements that have been released to the public by witnesses--the fact is that pretty much everybody that was inside the White House, from the whistleblower to all of the other witnesses that have released opening statements--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: --had profound discomfort with what Rudy Giuliani was doing and believed-- and, again, this is all very public-- believed that military aid was being held up for the President's partisan gain.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Congressman Himes, thank you very much for joining us this morning.\u00a0And, as you said, we are bringing now into the conversation your friend Texas Republican Congressman Will Hurd. He joins us this morning from San Antonio. Good morning to you, Congressman. Let's-- let's start on that point of discrepancy between the two of you. Congressman Himes said there is nothing being withheld from the minority. You signed a letter with eight other Republicans saying yes, there is information being withheld from you.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD (R-Texas/@HurdOnTheHill/Intelligence Committee): Well, Margaret, it's always a pleasure to be with you on a Sunday morning talking about important issues and-- and I want to confirm one fact. Jim Himes and I are indeed friends and we have worked together. That may shock a-- a lot of the American people that Republicans and-- and Democrats actually work together. Here-- here's why I signed that letter. My-- my issue is not necessarily with the information we're getting in advance because Congressman Himes is right. Sometimes those documents are given at midnight before the hearing. My concern is with the information that the committee has access to after these depositions are done. As a member of the committee, I was only able to get access to the transcript of the Ambassador Volker interview a couple of days ago and that interview had been conducted almost three weeks prior. You know why haven't we gotten access to all the text messages that Ambassador Volker has sent over? I haven't been able to review that. These depositions have been going on for ten or-- or twelve hours a day and you're not able to sit in all of them. So I want to know why hasn't that information been made available to you, Margaret? And I appreciate you asking the question about when some of this stuff is going to be made available because I think the press and the Fourth Estate plays an important check and balance in this. And-- and I would say, you know, this is also not an impeachment inquiry. These are just regular-- these are just reg-- regular oversight hearings. And why are we doing this in the Intelligence Committee? You know this is-- when it-- when it started this was a whistleblower, whose identity we should be protected. I was one of the few Republicans that said the whistleblower allegations were significant and serious enough that we should investigate. Even--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --Chairman Schiff has said this-- this-- that we shouldn't have the whistleblower in front of the committee so why is-- why is the intel committee doing this when the intel committee should be looking at the intelligence we had on Turkey before they moved in to Syria where we should be calling--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --intelligence professionals to come in and tell us, you know, how are we going to be prepared to fight a resurgent ISIS which is going to happen--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I do want to ask you--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --after this?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I do want to ask you about Syria but just to be clear you are permitted to sit in on those depositions. You just have not--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: Well--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --chosen to, correct?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: For-- for sure. I-- I've- I've sat--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --in a lot of them, but I haven't also gotten the information after it was over. Those are all being transcribed. The evidence that is given in those meetings has not been made fully available to-- to Republicans and there's issues like Republican staff is being limited from being in some of these hearings when the majority staff is able to have more and-- and having staff in those-- those interviews are-- are super-important.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that there was, if not a quid pro quo, an understanding or a perception of one between the White House and Ukraine?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: That-- that's a good question. And to me that's the heart of this-- this-- this matter. And what was the-- you know, if there was a quid pro quo, what was it for? Was it for investigation of the previous election? Or was it to get dirt on-- in-- it for-- for 2020? And what we haven't heard yet-- we haven't heard from any Ukrainian official that felt like there was this arrangement. We haven't even had an-- a Ukrainian official tell a State Department official that their-- that they felt like their arms were being twisted. I would have thought based on some of the State Department officials that we've met-- that we've interviewed so far, that you would even get an inkling of that was happening. When I was in the CIA, I participated in, you know, diplomacy as well. And this is very often that a-- the-- the country you're posted to, in this case, let's say, Ukraine, if they hear something, they're going to go to their contacts at the embassy and say--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --hey, what does this actually mean? And we haven't gotten any whiff of that when it comes to this-- to this issue. I also want to know who did Rudy Giuliani actually talk to.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: We know he's-- we know for a fact he's talked to two Ukrainians. The former--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you'd like him--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --AG--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --to come before the committee and answer questions--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: Oh, for sure--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --from Republicans too?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: I think-- I think-- I think--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --having Rudy-- Mayor Giuliani come and testify is-- is important.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to Syria because I know you--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --feel strongly about this and do agree with Leader McConnell who said it was a grave mistake for the President to have pulled out of Syria. Is Congress just completely powerless here to limit-- limit the damage that you see?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: Our-- we have some restrictions, it's always easier to compel an administration to stop doing something than it is to-- to begin something. I think what we could be doing now is bringing in some of the-- the heads of the military, the heads of the intelligence service, the heads of our humanitarian organizations to talk about what are we going to do to-- to prevent ISIS from becoming resurgent, to prevent ISIS from doing some coming back into that region. How are we going to be prepared for the humanitarian crisis, which is already happening and that's why I think the-- the leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, was-- was correct in saying that this is, indeed, a grave mistake. ISIS is going to come back. We know that there is about thirty thousand ISIS fighters that are throughout that region. We know the leader of ISIS is still around. And now in-- instead of saying this is a peace deal, unfortunately, and I still-- I still haven't seen all the details but what I am learning it looks more like terms of surrender than a peace deal. And--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Should--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --unfortunately, our-- our-- our enemies and our adversaries like Iran, Russia, Turkey, they're playing chess and unfortunately--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: --this administration is playing checkers.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, yes or no. Should President Erdogan of Turkey come to the White House next month?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: That's-- that's a tough question. I think--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE WILL HURD: You know-- yeah, it's a tough question.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. That's not a yes or no, but we'll give you time. Thank you, Congressman. I got to leave it there.\u00a0We'll be back in one minute with General Tony Thomas, former commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with General Tony Thomas who retired earlier this year as the commanding general of U.S. Special Operations Command. He spent thirty-nine years in the U.S. Army. Sir, thank you very much for joining us. Something you know intimately, of course, is what the U.S. architecture in Syria was and the work that we did with the Kurdish-led SDF forces. You helped set all of that up. The leader of those forces, General Mazloum, says this is a terrible deal for him. President Trump says it's a great one for humanity. Which is it?\u00a0GENERAL RAYMOND THOMAS (Retired) (Former Commander of U.S. Special Operations Command): Well, Margaret, I think it's-- it's best we start by-- the discussion by talking about how we got here. Four years ago when we had no real solutions, no real plan to take on the caliphate that ISIS had declared in northeastern Syria, we were introduced to a group called the YPG. They are a group of Kurdish Syrians who were barely surviving in the area of Kobani up on the border with Turkey. And all they asked for at that time was our close air support. We've had some faltering efforts to try and develop some other partners that had come to nothing. And so we helped-- we helped the YPG at that point in time. That's where I made my personal acquaintance with-- with General Mazloum and then, remarkably, and-- and I-- I attribute it to some incredible efforts by our Special Operations Forces, we were able to-- to form a partner force that was several thousand when we started, ended up being in the-- in the realm of about seventy thousand mixed--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0GENERAL RAYMOND THOMAS: --Arabs, Kurds and Christians who took the fight to ISIS. And so they have been our great partner up till now. We knew that this would come to some eventual conclusion, but I think they and we were surprised by how abruptly it came to a halt.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel that the Kurds led by General Mazloum are, essentially, being asked to surrender?\u00a0GENERAL RAYMOND THOMAS: I think they are being asked to survive. And, truthfully, the conversation that we've had with them-- and I was partner with Brett McGurk at the time was the intent that they will be part of the future of Syria, whatever that entailed and, truthfully, we didn't have a-- a solid plan for how-- how it would end. But they believe that they would be part of the fabric of the future of Syria. And-- and-- and, obviously, right now, they are forced to make deals with the Syrian regime and the Russians.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's-- that's an important point you raise there because the State Department has said that no-- no promise was ever made to the Kurds to help protect them. But you're saying there was some understanding?\u00a0GENERAL RAYMOND THOMAS: There was absolutely a discussion. Brett McGurk and I were there in Kobani where we said that they would be part of the future discussion of Syria in-- in return for doing our bidding. That was absolutely the-- the-- the approach from the previous administration, obviously, carried over into the current administration, but they were not fighting for free. They were fighting to be part of that-- that future demographic.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mitt Romney called this a bloodstain on the annals of American history. Is that how you would put it?\u00a0GENERAL RAYMOND THOMAS: I-- I don't know that I would be that hyperbolic. I-- it-- it is certainly going to be a challenge for our future friends and allies in terms of our staying power. This has devolved to a Turk-Kurd issue when reality is that it was all about ISIS. So, we have not finished our business with ISIS. You heard the previous comment-- commentators say there are thirty thousand ISIS left. The- the debate is tens of thousands. But, nonetheless, it reminds me very much of 2011 where we did not finish what we started and we were back two years later when ISIS came out of the-- out of the ruin of what was al-Qaeda in Iraq at the time.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do believe that ISIS will resurge?\u00a0GENERAL RAYMOND THOMAS: I think they'll have a-- a-- a great opportunity to do that because you've got all the precursors that existed before the Assad regime. Representative government, or not, in Iraq. So there'll be a void, and I think they will rally. These are resilient adversaries. We've done nothing to knock down the ideology, and I think they'll see this as certainly a respite if not an opportunity to have a resurgence. So I-- I am concerned about that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, General, this term endless wars is something that is really popular on the campaign trail both for President Trump and for Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, who use it frequently. Do you see this as a broader trend in this country towards isolationism?\u00a0GENERAL RAYMOND THOMAS: Hard to tell and-- and, truthfully, none of us support endless wars. Most-- most specifically, those of us in the military who were served in the military but reality is we have had difficulty ending what we've started. On-- you know, you could go back to Vietnam, the Korean War, et cetera. And, in this case, we jumped into Syria which is a morass. Where I was not too long ago we were within mortar range of Syrian regime forces, Russian forces, Russian paramilitary forces that we've already fought, Iranian forces of all sorts of varieties, Shia militia, Turks and their surrogates, just-- and the Israelis over the top. Very, very complex-- I can't imagine a more complex situation. So, obviously, how we-- how we finish there is a challenge, but also how we stay engaged in other places so that we don't have to conduct larger scale operations.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. General, thank you very much for your insights.\u00a0We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Tomorrow on CBS THIS MORNING, 2020 contender Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will sit down for their first joint interview since she endorsed him for President. They talk the future of his campaign, including whether she would ever consider being his running mate. More tomorrow.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but we will be right back with analysis on all the news of the week. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're now joined by former acting director of the CIA and CBS News senior national security contributor, Michael Morell as well as career diplomat, former ambassador William Burns, who also recently authored a book called The Back Channel. Thanks so much to both of you for being here.\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL (Former CIA Deputy Director/CBS News Senior National Security Contributor/@MichaelJMorell): You're welcome.\u00a0WILLIAM BURNS (Former Deputy Secretary of State): Thank you. Great to be with you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on the immediate crisis around Syria. Mike, you know the general who, clearly, knows what's happening on the ground. He was pretty polite in what he said but his frustration in terms of the promises made to the Kurds was clear.\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: How much of a loss to U.S. intelligence is it to have this pullout from northern Syria?\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: So, the Kurds were during a number of things for us. They were actually fighting ISIS for us in a very significant way and that is now lost. They were also collecting intelligence for us and giving that to us so that we could use it in our fight against ISIS and on the other side of the border in what the Iraqis were doing and I don't know that we've lost that but I bet you we either have or it is at significant risk.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And who benefits from that besides ISIS?\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: ISIS benefits. The Russians benefit because they're going to be the ones getting that intelligence now or the Syrian-- the Syrian regime is going to benefit. But the-- the biggest-- the biggest winner here is ISIS.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Bill, I mean, you've-- you've negotiated with Erdo\u011fan, with a number of these regional players. You know, typically, it-- it-- it's a rule that military presence gives diplomatic leverage when you're in a negotiation. When Vice President Pence went to Turkey this week, he promised to lift U.S. sanctions. He seemed to promise that the U.S. allies would withdraw from this area, as well. Was this a negotiation or was this, as some say, a surrender?\u00a0WILLIAM BURNS: Yeah, I mean, I think there was a smart way and a dumb way to deal with what was a very complicated situation in which we had modest leverage in northeast Syria. I think we chose the dumb way. In one impulsive presidential phone call, we in a sense gave away our leverage. And then in a pretty hasty negotiated cease-fire, we threw the Kurds under the bus and, essentially, gave Erdogan everything he wanted. And so while the President has called this a great deal, if this is a great deal, I'd hate to see what a bad one is because the winners, as Mike suggested, are not only the Turks and the Russians but also the Assad regime and the Iranians and I am afraid, ultimately, ISIS which is going to try to revive itself out of the chaos and the insecurity and the grievance on which it thrives.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But is this hyperbolic in some ways? I mean that American influence has diminished because of this one single decision.\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: I don't think so at all. So you have all of what Bill said in terms of what happens in the Middle East but there's also the broader message that this sends to the entire world, right? And there's two things. One is that might makes right, right? That you can accomplish with violence differences between countries and that's not something that is in American interest, right, to have that view in the world. The other is that the American word, right, the American guarantees that we provide to people aren't worth anything, right? That at the end of the day is going to strengthen people like China and people like Russia who are going to come in behind us and make promises that they can't keep.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It was-- it's always interesting to hear General Thomas say there was an understanding that America had given its word there. Bill, I want to switch to another topic because you know, personally, many of the diplomats who have gone up to Capitol Hill and behind closed doors given testimony about what has happened with Ukraine. You were scathing in an op-ed that you wrote. In terms of Secretary Pompeo, you said was derelict in his duty, not protecting his diplomats. He took a shot at you this morning and said you're just auditioning for a role in the next administration as Elizabeth Warren's secretary of state. Is that what you're doing?\u00a0WILLIAM BURNS: No. You know, my-- my concerns-- the concerns I expressed in that article are not about politics. You know like Michael, I spent three and a half decades proudly serving secret-- Presidents of both parties. My concerns are about the hollowing out of American diplomacy, whether you measure that in tangible ways, the sidelining of career expertise, not standing up for your people when they are unfairly accused, but also intangible ways. You know when President Trump was asked a little more than a year ago whether he was concerned about a record number of senior vacancies in the State Department, he said, \"No, not really because I am the only one who matters.\" That's diplomacy as an exercise in narcissism, not the diplomacy I learned as a young diplomat many years ago working for Presidents like George H. W. Bush and secretaries of state like Jim Baker.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But for people on the outside when they hear the President say, well, this is just deep state bureaucrats being frustrated they are being sidelined. What is important about having done this professionally?\u00a0WILLIAM BURNS: What-- what's--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean what-- what is it that is lost when you have one of the President's friends intervene as you had Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland, who is a political appointee, a financial donor. Many Presidents appoint financial donors to ambassadorships.\u00a0WILLIAM BURNS: That's true. But I think what we're seeing right now is career public servants, like Ambassador Yovanovitch, who are fulfilling their obligation to tell the truth when they are asked by Congress and they are doing it honorably and they are doing it with their heads held high. That's a pretty sharp contrast to the behavior of the President and people around him who are doing a pretty good job of concealing their own sense of decency right now.\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: And just to-- just to add, Margaret, expertise, knowledge, experience are extraordinarily important to making the right decisions in government and that's what's being lost by not relying on these people.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. I mean the intelligence community has been accused by this President of having its own deep state of just-- he was disrupting and they didn't like it and they pushed back, is the President's narrative around this. The attorney general who launched this investigation into the origins of the Russia probe, which concluded definitively that it was Russia that meddled in the 2016 election, seems to be expanding this probe.\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What is the impact of this on the intelligence community?\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: So, I think that-- that Durham's investigation at Barr's behest into the intelligence community's work on the link between the Trump campaign and the Russians is okay in one respect and not okay in the other. The respect that it's okay is taking a look at what the intelligence community did and answering the question: was it done by the book from a legal perspective? Was it consistent with statute? That's okay to me. What's not okay is to put the analysts under a spotlight and say, did they get the analysis right? Why is that not okay for me? It's a-- it's not okay for two reasons. One is that the Justice Department has no experience, no knowledge of, no particular perspective to bring to bear on analysis and they are likely to get the answer wrong because their standards of making a judgment are very, very, very different from the intelligence community standards. And I think there is going to be an effect on analysts who now have to go out and hire lawyers before they sit down with a Department of Justice prosecutor. There is going to be an effect on analysts in terms of them saying, do I really want to make the hard call in the future?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you-- John Brennan, former head of the CIA, and Jim Clapper, former Director National Intelligence, have-- CBS has confirmed that they have been approached for--\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: Yes. Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --to answer these questions.\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you saying this is all political and not legitimate?\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: So-- so there are questions, right? There are questions out there about whether the intelligence community and the FBI did the right thing, right? From a legal perspective, I think it's okay to look at that and put that issue to rest.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: I don't like looking at analysis because that's a completely different issue.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Last word here. Ambassador, Mike brought up all these people having to go out and hire lawyers and sort of defend their positions. Do you see this as a long-term hit to the national security architecture of this country?\u00a0WILLIAM BURNS: It is. I mean, I think it's-- it's really taking a toll on career public servants and on expertise, as Michael said, at precisely the moment when the United States needs to rely on that expertise whether it's in the intelligence community, the State Department, the Defense Department more than the other time because we're on a very competitive international landscape and we're digging a very deep hole for ourselves right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks very much to both of you for lending us your expertise.\u00a0We'll be right back with our political panel.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our political panel for some analysis. And we know you need it, it's been a busy week. Susan Davis is a congressional correspondent for NPR. Jamal Simmons is the host of The Remedy on Hill TV, a Democratic strategist, and now--congratulations--a new CBS News political contributor.\u00a0JAMAL SIMMONS (Hill.TV/@JamalSimmons/CBS News Political Contributor): Thank you. It's good to be here.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome to the family.\u00a0Michael Steel is a Republican strategist and Paula Reid is a White House correspondent here at CBS. And she also keeps a very close eye on the Justice Department for us as well. So, Paula, you're a lawyer.\u00a0PAULA REID (CBS News White House Correspondent/@PaulReidCBS): Recovering.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, yeah, recovering. Tell me what happened this week when Mick Mulvaney went to that podium and said what he said. This morning he is out there trying to walk it back yet again.\u00a0PAULA REID: That's right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: (INDISTINCT) change.\u00a0PAULA REID: Well, Democrats have taken some-- some criticism for holding most of their hearings behind closed doors, hearing from witnesses, not-- not in the public sphere. But then they got the best witness imaginable, not just in the public sphere but on national television at the White House podium. Mulvaney came out, not only did he confirm the quid pro quo, which he-- he has subsequently walked back. But that is a significant-- that's a significant blow to the impeachment defense, but he also got it muddied the waters even further on the Durham review, which is already under some scrutiny as Morell just mentioned as to whether this is actually a review where they are trying to gather facts or whether they are trying to give the President a political win. So Democrats could not have asked for a better witness than Mick Mulvaney at the podium. And this morning, he tried to just deny that he said a-- there was a quid pro quo. I went back, I looked through the transcript. He was asked repeatedly, are you saying this aid was tied to cooperation in this investigation? And he said, yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And the DOJ did not like what they heard. They issued a statement.\u00a0PAULA REID: Not at all. They did issue a statement. I got some other comments to words I can't say on TV. But they were livid because they know that the Durham review all-- is all-- but there already is some skepticism about that if this is Barr trying to do what the President has long asked the Justice Department to do. And so to have Mulvaney muddied the waters, they were not happy.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Sue, you had Adam Schiff who is leading--\u00a0SUSAN DAVIS (NPR/@DaviSusan): Mm-Hm.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --this investigation as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He said Mulvaney took it from very bad to worse. This was a gift to him. But does it actually move the needle politically in anyway?\u00a0SUSAN DAVIS: Yes, because I think to Paula's point this happened on public television, which is the problem that the Democrats have had is making this case to the public. A lot of what we know, and we should-- most of what we know has been leaked either by Democrats on the committee or through the testimony from the people that have come, that have given it to us. They have been-- there has been some fifty-five hours of testimony just last week. And we don't know a lot of that. So when these public moments happen, certainly, Mulvaney helped Democrats case. I mean it was-- also what it had the effect of doing was blowing up three weeks of semi-coordinated Republican messaging on Capitol Hill, trying to defend the President's actions. And Mulvaney saying that erase all of it and left all of the President's allies on the Hill once again scrambling to try and defend this behavior.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not the first time that has happened, though, Michael, for--\u00a0MICHAEL STEEL (Republican Strategist/@michael_steel): No.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --for Republicans to have to adapt to the changing talking point. Does it matter in terms of changing the calculus of standing by the President?\u00a0MICHAEL STEEL: Of course, it makes it much more difficult to stand by the President when he admits that there is a quid pro quo, when his administration admits that there is a quid pro quo, I do think to, Sue's point, this highlights the weakness of House Democrats' efforts right now because they are doing it behind close-- behind closed doors. Because they are not making a public case, impeachment is an inherently political exercise and they are not telling the public why it needs to happen.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But which Republicans are actually going to back away?\u00a0MICHAEL STEEL: That's a very, very difficult question. I think right now a lot of the smartest Republicans, at least in the Senate, are sticking with what he did was wrong but it does not rise to the level of impeachment a year before the election. And that's a position they can-- they can defend at least until the next shoe drops.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The caveat there there being-- being key. Jamal, I mean, for-- for us on the campaign trail, we also had the other Democratic attempt to not impeach the President, to remove him from office through the election path. Anything that actually moved the needle on that debate stage that we all watched?\u00a0JAMAL SIMMONS: Well, the debates-- debates didn't move the needle for a couple of candidates. I think Pete Buttigieg did something very well at the debate stage. He-- he kind of stood up for American honor and integrity, you didn't really hear a lot of people can make that argument and-- but the national security, defense on that stage. I thought it was very strong. Amy Klobuchar, obviously, has had a moment. What's tough for her is she doesn't have any money. There's a say, you know, in order to catch lightning you got to have a bottle. She doesn't really have very much of (INDISTINCT) so she's going to have some trouble voting up. I'm going to give it to one more thing that Michael just said, the difference between what the Republicans trying to say that if Trump-- Trump did something wrong with that impeachable. Democrats did this when Bill Clinton was in office. The difference here is Bill Clinton went on television in August of 1998 and said what I did was wrong. He actually took accountability after getting cornered. It's an accountability for what he did was wrong, was then gave every Democrat the ability to go out in public and say that without getting in trouble with the White House.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0\u00a0JAMAL SIMMONS: That's not the rule right here with the Republicans in the Senate, in the House, with the President. And I think if I were the White House, they don't pay me for advice, they need a-- they need a war room fast, but they can coordinate their messaging. They need a Mark Fabiani or Chris Lehane or somebody who can stand the podium and say or stand in some part-- part of the--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0JAMAL SIMMONS: --complex and give people the facts from the White House perspective. Otherwise somebody else is going to catch a case.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to take a quick break.\u00a0Regroup. Come back with more from our panel. So stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with our political panel. It was a busy news week. It was also a sad one, particularly here on Capitol Hill with the passing of Elijah Cummings, really a-- a giant in Washington.\u00a0SUSAN DAVIS: On a human level, I think Cummings was what fewer and fewer members of Congress are as he had commanded profound respect across the political spectrum. And you had, obviously, Democrats in the words of Nancy Pelosi, she said they lost a North Star for the party. But you also saw effusive praise from Republicans who he did hardcore hand-to-hand combat with over the years, who also praised him and sort of one of the honest players in the game. On a practical political level, Democrats have also lost one of their best chairmen.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SUSAN DAVIS: Also one of their chairmen who was leading the impeachment investigation and not beyond the impeachment investigation, oversight the committee he was running was looking at everything from the treatment of children at the border, to the cost of prescription drugs, core Democratic Party issues in which he was a player, and figuring out who's going to fill that role is going to be incredibly hard for Democrats. One other thing I would say is the speaker announced he will lie in state in the Capitol this week that does not happen very often. The last member of Congress who did it was John McCain. Obviously, a very storied career. So it is a testament to his life and legacy that he's going to be given that honor.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And Jamal--\u00a0JAMAL SIMMONS: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --you and your family knew him.\u00a0JAMAL SIMMONS: Yeah. He was my wife's first boss out of college. So he was a very close member of her network and mentor. And I interviewed Cedric Richmond this week for our show on the Hill, and he-- he said very specifically that there were tears in the caucus, people were fighting back tears in the Democratic caucus when they had the meeting after he passed away. And I think there's a real loss not only there but he sat as a bridge between sort of the-- the squad that everybody talks about, because he had three members of the squad that's had on that government oversight committee. He kind of tried to mentor them. So he was one of the voices from kind of the old guard at some of this new guard was going to listen to. So the Democrats are-- they've lost a-- a big voice-- a big voice personally and there's a void there also and how they govern the caucus.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and he was a friend to this show, and I know we remembered him this week. But when it came to the job he was doing in this moment, I think you, Jamal, said he was signing subpoenas--\u00a0JAMAL SIMMONS: He was-- he was--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --on the day he died.\u00a0JAMAL SIMMONS: The night before he asked the staff to come up and he was signing documents.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know one of the stories that Mick Mulvaney also brought to the public eye this week. Paula, Michael, was this decision to bring the G7 world leaders to the President's own golf course, Doral, next year?\u00a0MICHAEL STEEL: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Last night that was reversed. It didn't take House Oversight to stop it from happening, though. Why do try-- they-- they--\u00a0MICHAEL STEEL: Yeah.\u00a0SUSAN DAVIS: They would have tried.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --definitely would have tried. Why the reversal?\u00a0MICHAEL STEEL: This is the first big high-profile reversal I have seen from President Trump of something that he was personally committed to personally in-- behind. I think it was because he was getting bipartisan pushback on this because it was simply, obviously, indefensible. And I think that his chief of staff's explanation this morning that the President still sees himself as being in the hospitality industry is profoundly disturbing for a number of Americans who'd like him to have higher priorities.\u00a0PAULA REID: This morning the White House is deferring to the President's tweet which effectively says, well, Democrats and the media were upset so I'm going to backtrack. Since when is that his philosophy? And we know this has to be a political calculation because the President floated this idea at the G7 this year in August. And at that time senior White House officials told me, of course, he wouldn't even mention that unless it had been vetted and they said it had been vetted, the Emoluments Clause concerns, conflict of interest. So they understood the legal and ethical concerns. They put it out there this week anyway. And then at some point they must have decided that without Republican support the optics of backtracking were preferable to the fight.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Michael, the President often says he doesn't back down. Does the fact that he did on this signal that he is getting worried that Republicans aren't there? Why?\u00a0MICHAEL STEEL: I think this is one more front he needed to fight-- he couldn't fight on when he was already fighting on Syria, on Ukraine. He needs to keep the support of those Republicans particularly in the Senate in order to avoid being removed from office. And I think this is one more fight he didn't want to have.\u00a0JAMAL SIMMONS: It just seems like that hotel, you know, they searched the entire country and this was the only place they could find was very Dick Cheney of them, right? You know he was the only vice president-- he was the only vice president that George Bush could find after he ran the--\u00a0MICHAEL STEEL: VP search.\u00a0JAMAL SIMMONS: --VP search. You know the hotel's just seem to function more and more sort of the presidential tip jar. They are the place where you go, you stay in Washington, you stay there, the President knows that you stay there before you go have your meeting in-- in-- in-- at the White House. And also if you are now a foreign leader, you know, you come and you stay at a presidential hotel, if you're in the Air Force and you stop in Europe, you go and stay at a presidential hotel. It just seems to be the place where the money gets a little put in the President's, you know, jar and then you can go and do business.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The-- the President claims it was not going to be for profit. That is what Mick said from the podium.\u00a0PAULA REID: Exactly, but they had no-- no explanation on how exactly they would determine what the costs were that should be either donated or just not pass along to the President. And the idea that the President's brand doesn't need any help, but we all know empirically that's not true. And he has taken a hit on his-- his personal business since he's come to the White House.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Jamal, I want to ask you about this extraordinary charge by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, that one of the 2020 candidates who was later confirmed she meant Tulsi Gabbard was somehow working for Russia. Why did she say that?\u00a0JAMAL SIMMONS: You know, it's-- it is often hard to know exactly what the Clintons are up to and-- and how they're thinking about things. What may be true, though, is that she is worried about something happening to the Democratic nominee that she feels happened to her in 2016, and she is willing to sacrifice herself to raise these questions very early, to try to preempt whatever those attacks may be. Now Tulsi Gabbard has a big following on the internet, she has a big following among some of the more progressive voices in the party, so they did not take this laying down. They came for Hillary Clinton pretty hard. But now we're talking about it on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they both came out swinging and pretty hard.\u00a0SUSAN DAVIS: Yeah, Tulsi shot back pretty hard. She did, I mean she's obviously someone who has been struggling in the Democratic presidential primary. It was kind of a bizarre attack, I mean, it was a bizarre news week to begin with, and then you add this Hillary Clinton attack out of nowhere on a member of her own party. I mean there is a certain underlying truth that if you listen to all the intelligence officials and members of Congress and some people in the administration, there is still ongoing efforts to meddle in the 2020 election.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SUSAN DAVIS: It's a real present threat to the country. I think Hillary Clinton could be a voice on that but the way that she stepped out to use it--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SUSAN DAVIS: --was just a really bizarre first step.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It was good to have all of you here today. Thanks for your analysis.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: There are a few things left that aren't political in this town, the Nationals heading to the World Series is one of them. But more vital are the public servants who work no matter if it is a Republican or a Democrat in office. They have uncomfortably stepped into the spotlight with this crisis and they are warning that their particular nonpartisan brand of patriotism is in danger.\u00a0This week and last, diplomats were stuck between the choice of defying a White House order not to answer questions or ignoring the congressional subpoena that compelled them. Each spoke out led first by Marie Yovanovitch, a respected ambassador who said she had nothing to do with Ukraine's scandal and may have had her career cut short because of that. One of the men working on that project, Ambassador Gordon Sondland, said he felt bad about it and even he, one of the President's friends, now thinks the professionals should have been left in charge. A senior aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mike McKinley, said he quit in part because no one was defending public servants like Marie against political targeting.\u00a0With more testimonies this week, it may be worth listening to those quiet voices who have issued a warning that mixing politics and foreign policy comes at a cost. And that personal benefit should not be confused with public good.\u00a0That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. And thank you to the Jones Day law firm for the facilities here on Capitol Hill. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I am Margaret Brennan.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014\u00a0One of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's guiding principles is: \"There's no education in the second kick of a mule.\"  Now, deep into a government shutdown he cautioned President Trump against, McConnell is not about to let himself be kicked again.  The Republican leader has been conspicuously deferential to Mr. Trump since the shutdown began. He's also been conspicuously absent from press availabilities with fellow Republican leaders after meetings with the president. He's waiting on the president and Democrats to make a deal to end it. The result is an unusually inactive profile for the GOP leader who's often the behind-the-scenes architect of intricate legislative maneuvers to resolve bitter partisan stalemates.  Democrats complain publicly \u2014 and some Republicans grumble privately \u2014 that the Senate is not fulfilling its role as a co-equal branch of government, a legislative check on the executive. They worry about ordinary Americans facing hardship waiting for a resolution to the standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for money to build the border wall with Mexico.  But the Kentucky Republican, who is up for re-election in 2020 in a state where Mr. Trump tends to be more popular than he is, sees no other choice than to stand back and let the president who took the country into the shutdown decide how he wants to get out of it.  McConnell said the \"solution to the problem\" is for the president, who he reminds is the only one who can sign a bill into law, to reach an agreement with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. \"There's no way around that,\" he told reporters this week.  Democrats wonder whatever happened to the mastermind of earlier legislative logjams. After all, the 30-year veteran of the Senate devised the way out of a debt ceiling crisis when tea party Republicans challenged then-President Obama; he brokered the deal with then-Vice President Joe Biden to avert the so-called \"fiscal cliff.\"  \"A few years ago, Leader McConnell remarked, 'Remember me? I'm the guy that gets us out of shutdowns,'\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, unearthing an interview McConnell did some years ago. \"Well, Leader McConnell, now's the time.... allow a vote on legislation and reopen the government.\"  McConnell has plenty of solutions at the ready, allies say. But he sees no value in trying to execute a deal that Mr. Trump may not ultimately endorse. It's not only a waste of time, in his view, it potentially exposes Republican senators up for re-election in 2020, including himself, as sideways to the president's wishes.  \"Everyone is demanding that McConnell 'do something.' What?\" asked GOP strategist Scott Jennings, a longtime McConnell ally. \"What is McConnell \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 going to tell Trump? Hey man, give up on the wall? That's crazy.\"  Jennings said rather than being seen as weak leader, the opposite is true: McConnell is showing strength by protecting Republicans from taking votes on bills that put them or the president on the spot as they try to force Democrats' hand.  \"He's not going to undercut the president of his own party,\" he said.  No sense being on the other side twice. Days before the shutdown, McConnell started executing the plan Republicans had largely agreed upon.  The strategy was simple: Give Trump a runway to take the case to the American people \u2014 including during his State of the Union address \u2014 before the next round of voting in February, according Republicans familiar with the plan.  All systems were go until the morning of final passage, but Mr. Trump opposed it.  McConnell was frustrated. \"He wasn't very happy about it to say the least,\" said retiring GOP Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas. \"He's a very crafty individual... very strategic... Mitch, if something doesn't work, he finds a way to make it work.\"  But this time, McConnell is not providing the way out. Yes, he's appearing at White House negotiating sessions. His staff meets for bipartisan talks with others. McConnell talks most every day to by phone to Mr. Trump. Asked about the senator's role during the shutdown, the president heaped on praise: \"He's really been fantastic.\"  Yet the leader, who was required to sit still as a child battling polio, is nothing if not a patient person. And so he waits.  Not all Republicans embrace the strategy. Some are growing anxious that Senate is essentially idle while hundreds of thousands of federal employees go without pay, wreaking havoc on their households and putting the broader economy at risk.  \"Right now, it's the Senate that really isn't doing anything, I think we should do something,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who is trying to build support for his bill to pay federal employees, including TSA airport security screeners, who are forced to work without paychecks.  \"I'm very sympathetic with the fact that we do need the president to sign something \u2014 so what's the point of bringing something up that's DOA \u2014 but we certainly can show some leadership here,\" he said. \"We could bring that up for votes.\"  As #MitchShutdown billboards dot the Kentucky countryside, McConnell, who will likely want Mr. Trump by his side as he runs for re-election, has given no indication he's feeling the heat.  He's likely more interested in voters like Mike Bickers of Lexington, a 65-year-old retired sales rep for Coca-Cola.  \"I don't want Mitch McConnell to cave on this,\" Bickers said. \"I want him to stick to his guns.\"  Mr. Trump won Kentucky in 2016 with nearly 63 percent of the vote, some 400,000 more votes than McConnell in his last Senate election. In 2018 Kentucky voters again embraced Trump in re-electing GOP Rep. Andy Barr, the congressman who was in a tight race until Mr. Trump visited, beginning a surge in Barr's favor.  McConnell's approval ratings, both nationally and in Kentucky, have never been high. But he has consistently been re-elected by running disciplined, well-funded campaigns.  One of the #MitchShutdown billboards is in Owensboro in western Kentucky, once a Democratic stronghold. Now its Republican mayor, Tom Watson, says he and many of the city's voters are happy to see McConnell and Mr. Trump \"totally agree on something\" over the border wall.  \"Senator McConnell,\" said Watson, \"I believe, is doing exactly what the Senate is supposed to do.\" ",

            "article_content": "Gaza City, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel and the militant Islamic Jihad group in Gaza reached a cease-fire on Thursday to end two days of heavy fighting that killed at least 34 Palestinians and paralyzed parts of Israel. It was only a few hours before the tense halt in fighting was tested by a volley of rockets fire from the Palestinian territory toward southern Israel. Islamic Jihad spokesman Musab al-Berim said the Egyptian-brokered deal went into effect at 5:30 a.m. Al-Berim said the cease-fire was based on a list of demands presented by his group late Wednesday, including a halt to Israeli targeted killings of the group's leaders. An Israeli military spokesman said the fighting in Gaza was \"over,\" confirming the cease-fire Islamic Jihad announced earlier. Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee tweeted Thursday morning that the operation had ended with Israel having targeted 25 Gaza militants, most of them from Islamic Jihad. Israel rarely acknowledges deals with Gaza militant groups but some restrictions were lifted on residents of the south, despite the continued fire of several rockets. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed in a tweet that at least five rockets were fired from Gaza toward Israel. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the new wave of rockets, and it wasn't clear how it might affect the fate of the cease-fire.\u00a0 Air raid sirens in southern Israel wailed as soon as the launches were detected. This round of fighting broke out early Tuesday after Israel killed a senior commander of the Iranian-backed militant group who was said to be behind a string of rocket attacks and who Israel said was believed to be planning a cross-border infiltration. The rare targeted killing by Israel sparked the heaviest fighting with Gaza militants since May. Islamic Jihad fired some 400 rockets toward Israel, while Israel responded with scores of airstrikes. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the policy of targeted killings had \"proved itself\" to be effective and that it would continue, despite word of the cease-fire. \"Everyone who was a top military official, who was set to carry out and was involved in terror or rocket firing against Israel was eliminated,\" he told Israeli Army Radio. \"And we intend to continue with this.\" The Reuters news service quoted Katz as telling Army Radio that Israel would hold fire as long as Palestinian militants did. \"Quiet will be answered with quiet,\" Katz said while denying Israel had decided to observe a broader cease-fire. Gaza's ruling Hamas militant group, which is much larger and more powerful than Islamic Jihad, stayed out of the fighting, indicating it would be brief. Palestinian officials reported 34 deaths, including a 7-year-old boy and six members of a single family. At least 16 of the dead were militants. The rocket fire crippled life across southern Israel as nonstop air-raid sirens canceled schools and forced people to remain indoors. At least three people were lightly wounded from shrapnel or shattered glass. Most rockets landed in open areas or were shot down by Israel's Iron Dome military defense system. Much of Gaza resembled a ghost-town, with almost no vehicles on the roads except for ambulances evacuating the wounded. Shortly after al-Berim's announcement, at least two rockets were fired out of Gaza, setting off sirens in southern Israel. It was not immediately clear who fired the rockets or whether the launches were intentional or misfires caused by electronic timers. But the Islamic Jihad said it was committed to ending the fighting, saying the fire was likely because word hadn't spread to all members about the halt to violence. Israel doesn't usually acknowledge deals with militant groups. But U.N. and Islamic Jihad officials were in touch Wednesday with Egyptian mediators, who typically broker deals to end fighting in Gaza, and Israel did not respond to the rocket launch. Also, the Israeli military's Home Front command tweeted that it was lifting restrictions in certain areas but leaving them in place in the areas surrounding Gaza. In Gaza, cars could be heard back on the streets as the territory appeared to be springing back to life. Israeli military drones could still be heard buzzing overhead. Late Wednesday, Islamic Jihad's leader, Ziad al-Nakhalah, announced three conditions for an end to the fighting: an end to targeted killings, a halt in Israeli shootings of protesters at weekly demonstrations along the Israeli border and easing a 12-year-old Israeli blockade that has devastated Gaza's economy. Israel imposed the blockade after Hamas violently seized control of Gaza in 2007 from the internationally backed Palestinian Authority. Israel considers Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which both seek its destruction, to be terrorist groups. The killing of Bahaa Abu el-Atta on Tuesday coincided with a strike in the Syrian capital of Damascus that targeted another Islamic Jihad commander. Israel hasn't claimed responsibility for that attack and the commander was not killed, but the strikes stepped up Israel's regional conflict with Iran and its proxies. Israel often strikes Iranian interests in Syria and the fresh fighting looked to awaken Israel's increasingly open conflict with Iran and its proxies in the region. Iran supplies Islamic Jihad with training, expertise and money. Although its base is Gaza, Islamic Jihad also has some of its leadership in Beirut and in Damascus, where it maintains close ties with Iranian officials. As Iran's proxy in Gaza, the group is key to Tehran's strategy of keeping pressure on Israel on all fronts. Iran has forces based in Syria, Israel's northern neighbor, and supports Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Israel has also claimed that Iran is using Iraq and far-off Yemen, where Tehran backs Shiite rebels fighting government forces and a Saudi-led coalition, to plan attacks against Israel. Hamas also receives some support from Iran. The violence came at a touchy time in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu heads a caretaker government after two elections ended inconclusively and after he failed twice to form a governing coalition. His main rival, former army chief Benny Gantz, is now trying to cobble together a government, but his chances appear slim. If he fails by next week, Israel could be on its way to an unprecedented third election in less than a year. Lawmakers from across the political spectrum typically rally behind the government during a military operation, and Netanyahu has briefed Gantz before and during the violence, setting off speculation the conflagration may succeed to push the men toward an agreement. The escalation also comes ahead of an expected indictment against Netanyahu for a number of corruption allegations. During the months of election campaigning, the long-serving Israeli leader has sought to depict himself as the only leader capable of steering Israel through its myriad security challenges, painting Gantz as weak despite his military bona fides. With the legal woes hovering, the latest round of violence could help to bolster Netanyahu's image.",

            "article_content": "On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click\u00a0here\u00a0to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sunday, October 13th. I am Margaret Brennan in the nation's capital and this is FACE THE NATION. We have breaking news this morning as the U.S. announces plan to withdraw the one thousand American troops still in Syria. MARK ESPER: I spoke with the President last night, and he directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria. MARGARET BRENNAN: And over what time period will you be pulling back? MARK ESPER: Well, it will be a deliberate withdrawal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of Defense Mark Esper broke the news to us just a short time ago. We'll have that interview. The move comes after President Trump pulled back dozens of American troops from northern Syria, a move that cleared the way for Turkey to stage an incursion there attacking the Kurds, a group that has long been a U.S. ally in the fight against ISIS. Mister Trump's actions have alienated both his allies abroad and on Capitol Hill. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm sort of an island of one again. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll have reaction from Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. Then, week three of the impeachment inquiry was notable for new subpoenas. Behind closed doors, testimony, and the White House stonewalling. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So they're pursuing an illegal, invalid, and unconstitutional, (EXPLETIVE DELETED) impeachment. MARGARET BRENNAN: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is here to give us an update on the investigation. Plus, the Chinese boycott the NBA after an official signal support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. We'll talk with Republican Senator Ted Cruz. And where do Americans stand on impeachment? We'll have the surprising results from two brand new CBS polls. All that, plus, analysis on the news of the week just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We are following two very big stories this Sunday. The impeachment investigation and the President's decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, a move that has turned into an international crisis. We begin this morning with the Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. Mister Secretary, welcome to FACE THE NATION. 3 MARK ESPER (Secretary of Defense/@EsperDoD): Good morning, Margaret. Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: The President pulled back from the border with Turkey but there are still about a thousand U.S. troops in Syria. Are you evacuating them? MARK ESPER: Look, it's a very terrible situation over there. A situation caused by the Turks by President Erdogan. Despite our opposition they decided to make this incursion into Syria. And at this point in time in the last twenty-four hours we learned that they likely intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned and to the west. And so we know that's happening. We also have learned in the last twenty-four hours that the Syrian forces intend-- I'm sorry, the Kurdish forces-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The SDF-- MARK ESPER: --are looking to cut-- the SDF, are looking to cut a deal, if you will, with the Syrians and the Russians to-- to counter-attack against the Turks in the north. And so we find ourselves as we have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies and it's a very untenable situation. So I spoke with the President last night after discussions with the rest of the national security team and he directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria. MARGARET BRENNAN: A deliberate withdrawal from the entire country? MARK ESPER: From northern Syria. MARGARET BRENNAN: From northern Syria. MARK ESPER: Right, which is where most of our forces are. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the one thousand troops-- MARK ESPER: That's correct.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --how long and over what time period will you be pulling back? MARK ESPER: Well, it's going to be a deliberate withdrawal and we want to conduct it as-- as safely and quickly as possible. So we want to make sure we deconflict a pullback of forces. We want to make sure we don't leave equipment behind. So I'm not prepared to put a timeline on it, but that's-- that's our general game plan. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you're doing this for U.S. force protection because of two advancing armies. Those armies are advancing after the U.S. had already pulled back. After the U.S. Air Force-- MARK ESPER: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that had controlled the airspace stopped doing so. 4 MARK ESPER: Well, we still have-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you actually believe they would advance if U.S. forces were there in-- in the numbers and with the force and with the commander-in-chief saying don't do this? MARK ESPER: I do, because in my lead up to talks with my counterpart of the past several weeks-- I've been on the job a little bit over two months. It became very clear to me that the Turks were fully committed to conducting this incursion. The Turks were committed to doing this. This should not be a surprise. And if you go back in time to when we first began this relationship with the-- with the Syrian Kurds at that time in 2014 the Turks were protesting at that moment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  MARK ESPER: And it's gone on and on and since that time they've actually implemented three incursions into northern Syria. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you actually believe Turkey would fire on U.S. forces? We are NATO allies. MARK ESPER: Well, I don't know whether they have-- they would or they wouldn't. We have reports already of indiscriminate fire landing near American forces. But they just-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that accidental? MARK ESPER: Well, we don't know-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that deliberate? MARK ESPER: We need-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that reckless? MARK ESPER: We need to sort that out. We've given them the locations of our forces. But, look, I-- I've been to war. I know what wars like. There's a fog out there and things happen and we want to make sure we don't put our soldiers in a situation where they could be killed or injured. And, look, even if the Turks decided not to attack forces-- I mean, they got over fifteen thousand forces. What we decide to pull back from that immediate zone of attack was about less than fifty, maybe two dozen forces. It would be irresponsible for me to keep them in that position. And allow-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But you did have U.S. air force-- MARK ESPER: And we still do-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --controlling airspace? MARK ESPER: And we-- and we still do. It was an-- a coordinated arrangement between us and the Turks. And despite our protestations, despite the fact that we urged the Turks not to do this, they decided to do it and we told them that we would not support them militarily in this action. 5 MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how does that not amount to a retreat? You're saying that the President of the United States, the Commander-in-Chief, said \"don't do this\" and then Erdo\u011fan said, \"I am\" and he said, \"Okay?\" MARK ESPER: Well I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm not going to fire back-- MARK ESPER: --I wouldn't characterize-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --I'm going to pull back? MARK ESPER: I-- I wouldn't characterize it this way-- that way. What I'm saying is we did not want to put American forces into harm's way. We did not want to get involved in a conflict that dates back nearly two hundred years between the Turks and the Kurds and get involved in another-- yet, another war in the Middle East. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when it comes to the forces you're talking about, the SDF you referred to, you said it has developed in the last twenty-four hours that you've learned-- MARK ESPER: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --they've struck a deal with Russia. MARK ESPER: Well, they are working on a deal. I don't know that it's been finalized, yet, but we're pretty confident that they will go in that direction barring some-- we're trying to make some last-minute interventions with President Erdogan. But, again, my expectation is President Erdogan would not agree to a cease-fire. He would not agree to move back across the border which we've been pushing him to do. And so every-- there's every expectation that the-- again, that the Syrian Kurds would cut a deal with the Syrian and Russian forces. MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, the reason the Syrian Kurds are striking a deal here is to protect themselves from being killed by Turkey. MARK ESPER: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's what the United States was doing for them. They were our allies that we were advising and assisting and protecting. It-- it sounds a lot like they were being left to be slaughtered. So, what choice were they left other than to find someone else to protect them? MARK ESPER: Look, the-- this, the Kurds have been very good partners in the D-ISIS campaign. They were very good fighters on the battlefield. We, obviously, enabled that as well. But, at the same time, we didn't sign up to fight the Turks on their behalf. And we've been very clear with them about that. That's why since I came into office over two months ago I worked week after week with my defense minister counterpart from Turkey and urged them not to do this. We cited all the reasons that are now playing out. The biggest being the likely release of ISIS fighters from these camps and prisons, not just that we see a humanitarian crisis emerging. We-- that this relationship between the United States and Turkey is being damaged. Their  6 standing in NATO and Europe is being hurt. We see European capitals coming out and criticizing President Erdogan for-- for this-- these actions. Everything that we told them-- all the reasons why we told them not to do this are-- are coming to bear. MARGARET BRENNAN: And what price will they pay for it? MARK ESPER: Well, we'll see over time. You see that-- that some European countries are already talking about specific sanctions and actions. The President is talking about the same. We should expect to see something like that along those same lines. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't that just drive them into the arms of Russia? MARK ESPER: I don't think so. We got to see how this plays out. But, again, we've got to take this one step at a time. It's a very fluid situation it's changing by the hour. MARGARET BRENNAN: You-- just in the past few hours online-- MARK ESPER: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --there have been videos circulating, horrific videos showing execution of some of these Kurdish allies of ours. There are reports of hundreds of ISIS fighters and family members just running free. There are over a hundred thousand individuals fleeing this violence according to the U.N. Does the United States have any idea who these forces are that Turkey is sending in, who these militias are? MARK ESPER: It's terrible. It's a terrible situation. We condemn it. We have condemned it. It's-- these are justice things that we told the Turks would happen and play out. Who's conducting it, it's unclear at this point in time. There are Kurdish regular for-- I'm sorry there are Turkish regular forces and there are Turkish proxy forces-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MARK ESPER: --engaged, as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we don't know who they are? MARK ESPER: We don't know exactly-- that's right. We don't know exactly who they all are and what they are doing. But we're hearing the same reports from the battlefield, as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: These are war crimes. MARK ESPER: It appears to be, if true, that they are-- would be war crimes. MARGARET BRENNAN: European allies are looking at this and when they hear the President say things like \"these ISIS fighters will just flee to Europe,\" they say that is not appreciating the alliance, that Turkey has been far too permissive in allowing ISIS fighters within its territory. They see this as inevitable that we are headed towards a terrorist attack-- MARK ESPER: We-- we-- 7 MARGARET BRENNAN: --because of this chaos that the U.S. is allowing in the vacuum. MARK ESPER: Well, let's be clear, the United States is not allowing this. Turkey committed this action. They decided to make an incursion in northern Syria despite our protestations, our urgings not to do it, all of our warnings. They decided to do it. The situation with the ISIS-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But the U.S. is being permissive, arguably, by pulling back-- MARK ESPER: We--we are-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --and not stopping them. MARK ESPER: We are doing what's in the interests of our service members not to put them in harm's way. Not to put twenty, thirty, forty soldiers up against a fifteen-thousand-man army which is using airstrikes, artillery, and ground forces to prosecute a war against the Turks whose roots go back over two hundred years. MARGARET BRENNAN: If the U.S. is fired at, do forces have the ability to defend themselves? MARK ESPER: They do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Can they fire back? MARK ESPER: They do. Absolutely. General Milley has made that clear to his counterpart. I made that clear to my counterpart. I warned him just the other day that they need to respect our positions on the ground. They need to respect our forces. And I reminded them that we have the right of self-defense and we will execute it if necessary. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, are you going to comply with the subpoena that the House provided you and provide documents to them regarding to the halt to military aid to Ukraine? MARK ESPER: Yeah, we will do everything we can to cooperate with the Congress. Just in the last week or two, my general counsel sent out a note as we typically do in these situations to ensure documents are retained. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a yes? MARK ESPER: That's a yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: You will comply with the subpoena? MARK ESPER: We will do everything we can to comply. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. All right. Thank you very much, Mister Secretary. Appreciate it. MARK ESPER: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We taped that interview a short time ago. Since then our David Martin reports that a U.S. official has told him U.S. troops have already begun moving out of their  8 positions in northern Syria. We'll have a report from Syria later on in the broadcast. But we want to go now to Illinois Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. He is in Ottawa, Illinois. Good morning to you, Congressman. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER (R-Illinois/@RepKinzinger): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: You wanted the President to rethink his position. We know from Secretary Esper this decision to pull out was made last night. What is the implication going to be? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, it's going to be terrible and you know the secretary is doing his job and you know he has to follow orders. But the reality we all know that if there were still those thirty or forty soldiers in that part of Syria that Turkey wouldn't attack. We actually had a pretty good kind of joint security situation being setup to de-escalate that area. In fact, pulling back those fifty troops or whatever it was has given license to Turkey and then now I think pulling out the remaining thousand in Syria is simply an excuse to get out. Look at it this way. You hear the President and people like Rand Paul talk about endless wars all the time and it's kitschy, but actually we were preventing an endless war. And-- and that actually commenced on Sunday now a week ago and so it's really depressing. And you know, for me as-- as a guy that served in the military and really, got into politics because I believe in the role America plays, to see this, yet, again you know leaving an ally behind, abandoning people that we, frankly, told that we were going to be with is disheartening, depressing. Frankly, it's weak and I don't see how it follows through on the President's promise, his biggest promise of the campaign to defeat ISIS because I think it is going to resurge. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the President putting U.S. national security at risk? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Yes, I certainly I-- I think so, yeah. And I mean look-- look at what's going to happen out of here. Now we have another group that now believes they can't rely on the United States. Th-- there's a lot of complication in the Kurd situation and I've seen all this Russian misinformation now on the internet that's being picked up by some of these political blogs that these are the bad Kurds and there's good Kurds. Well, look, there are Kurds that aren't-- aren't the best folks in the world. But there are also people that we have chosen to equip to fight ISIS that we were with. We had created a situation in which there was stability and out of an impulsive decision I think that the President made-- otherwise it was cold and calculated because he'd been thinking about it for a while and nobody else knew. The Kurds found out on Twitter for goodness sakes. We have left them to the wolves. And-- and the message this is sending to our allies around the world I think is-- is really going to be bad. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what are Republicans in Congress going to do about it? Are you completely powerless? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: No, we are not powerless. I mean the President has a lot of power though and I said that no matter-- even under President Obama, I said the President's got a lot of power that's in the Constitution. The things we can do we are going to do. We've got a resolution of condemnation I think next week, as well as some significant sanctions. The President tweeted about sanctions this morning but I think he needs to make sure he's following through on them and they're not going to be surface sanctions. They're going to really hit Turkey hard. And then the other thing we can do is be outspoken about this. The  9 American people you know who want strength and leadership, who were promised by this President that we would defeat ISIS, deserve to hear the truth and not these things like end with-- endless war that you hear some on the kind of libertarian spectum-- spectrum talk about. There is now a war that's been commenced in Syria because we have pulled fifty troops out from being able to prevent that war. MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the secretary acknowledge war crimes. The State Department has said they're afraid of ethnic cleansing. So looking at all of that, aren't sanctions just punitive? They're not preventative. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a responsibility here to do something? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Yeah. Well, I think there is. I think it is not necessarily going to prevent Turkey from doing what they are doing. This has been Turkey's dream for a long time. And the President basically gave the green light to do it. They're going to be important. But I think we also have to continue to say this which is when the United States backs away, chaos follows through. And we had a situation of stability there. It wasn't perfect. Erdogan probably didn't want to have to do joint patrols with the U.S.-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: --because he wanted to attack. But we're the United States of America and we can prevent things like that. We have to remember the strength we have and not just try to run away from every conflict we could have. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the Wall Street Journal had an editorial that was pretty strong here in sharply criticizing the President quote, \"for his habit of impulsive judgment.\" And they argued that his judgment can be so reckless that many voters who took a risk on him the first time will ask if he's worth a second gamble in 2020. \"Impeachment won't defeat Donald Trump in 2020, but Donald Trump might.\" Does this make you question whether you're going to support President Trump in 2020? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, I'm-- I'm not going to go there and question whether I'm going to support, but it does, you know-- I think the President needs to be aware that in-- and I know Republican base voters. I represent both Republicans and Democrats. I have a Republican district. One of the things they loved about Donald Trump is-- they're like he says what he means. He's tough. He's taken the fight to ISIS and I'm having a hard time seeing how basically pulling out of Syria-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: --and it's not just about protecting the Kurds. It's about getting intel and fighting ISIS. And I don't see how that's going to be a position of strength. So we'll have to see how 2020 plays out on that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes no, should Erdogan come to the White House next month as planned? 10 REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: No, absolutely not. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Congressman. We'll be back in one minute with the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff. Don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the other big story we have been watching that of the impeachment inquiry into charges that the President and his allies pressured Ukraine to investigate unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. We're joined now by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff. Good morning to you, Chairman. Good to have you here. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (Intelligence Committee Chairman/@RepAdamSchiff/D-California): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we move to impeachment I want to ask for your reaction to the President's decision to pull out of Syria. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I agree with my Republican colleague. I think this is disastrous. It's a complete capitulation to Erdogan that is putting at great peril probably our strongest ally in the fight against ISIS. And that is the Syrian Kurds. They were fighting side by side with American forces we have pulled the rug out from under them. They're being slaughtered. There are war crimes being committed against them. And we're seeing ISIS fighters released from custody just as we predicted would happen. And for the President to say well you know they're just going to go to Europe. We're not going to have an ally left after this presidency. You can imagine how Europe feels about the President of the United States saying well we're not really concerned about foreign fighters going to Europe. They're going to pose a direct threat to our homeland as well and we ought to care about our allies. This wouldn't be happening but for this impulsive decision by the President to capitulate to Erdogan by precipitously withdrawing our forces. It's just what Secretary Mattis warned against. Erdogan took this as a green light. And who can blame him for perceiving that that was the President's intention and the consequences will be far lasting the damage to our standing. The fact the Kurds are now entertaining going to the Russians to protect them because the Americans wouldn't. This is just an unmitigated disaster. And-- and I deeply fear, as Secretary Mattis has said, that this will result in the resurgence of ISIS. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to get to the other big topic and that is the impeachment inquiry that you are leading. Do you see this widening? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we're keeping our focus right now on the President's coercion of an ally, that is Ukraine, to create these sham investigations into his political opponent. We have discovered in very short order not only the contents of that call but also the preparatory work that went into that call. The effort to condition something the Ukrainian president deeply sought and that was a meeting with the President to establish that this new president of Ukraine had a powerful patron--the President of the United States. It was of vital importance to Ukraine was being conditioned on digging up dirt on the Bidens. 11 MARGARET BRENNAN: So you see that as the quid pro quo-- REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --not just the military aid? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: First of all, there doesn't need to be a quid pro quo, but it is clear already I think from the text messages that this meeting that the Ukraine president sought was being conditioned on their willingness to interfere in the U.S. election to help the President. That is a terrible abuse of the President's power. Now whether that abuse goes further that is the withholding of military aid also as leverage. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: There's certainly strong indications that that is true as well. And we're going to get to the bottom of it. But here you have a President of the United States abusing his power to the detriment of our national security and doing so to get yet another foreign country to intervene in our election. It's hard to imagine more of a corruption of his office than that. MARGARET BRENNAN: When will you begin to hold public hearings? The polling that CBS has done has shown that Americans really are not clear on what to think about this impeachment inquiry over the past two weeks of work you've done. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, actually, you know, I think that the public attitudes have swiftly moved in strong support of the impeachment inquiry. And you know what we were trying to do is do a methodical and, yet, with a sense of urgency investigation to these matters. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Republicans say it's behind closed doors so you can cherry pick information-- REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --to be released. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --the-- the Republicans would like nothing better because they view their role as defending the President being the President's lawyers. If witnesses could tailor their testimony to other witnesses. They would love for one witness to be able to hear what another witness says so that they can know what they can give away and what they can't give away. There's a reason why investigations and grand jury proceedings, for example, and I think this is analogous to a grand jury proceeding, are done out of the public view initially. Now we may very well call some of the same witnesses or all the same witnesses in public hearings as well. But we want to make sure that we meet the needs of the investigation and not give the President or his legal minions the opportunity to tailor their testimony and in some cases fabricate testimony to suit their interests. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been-- well, the whistleblower has made these complaints and hand them-- handed them over. Why push for this whistleblower to come before Congress? Because a-- Republicans are calling for it and some Democrats would like to ask questions, too, but this information's already out there. Can't the committee do its own investigation without  12 risking the identity of this person being-- REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: We can-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --public? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: You know and I think initially, before the President started threatening the whistleblower, threatening others calling them traitors and spies and suggesting that you know we used to give the death penalty to traitors and spies and maybe we should think about that again. Yes, we were interested in having the whistleblower come forward. Our primary-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Not anymore? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, our primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected. Indeed, now there's more than one whistleblower, that they are protected. And given that we already have the call record, we don't need the whistleblower who wasn't on the call to tell us what took place during the call. We have the best evidence of that. We do want to make sure that we identify other evidence that is pertinent to the withholding of the military support, the effort to cover this up by hiding this in a classified computer system. We want to make sure that we uncover the full details about the conditionality of either the military aid or that meeting with Ukraine's president. It may not be necessary to take steps that might reveal the whistleblower's identity to do that. And we're going to make sure we protect that whistleblower. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know who was on that July 25th call? You know all the participants? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I can't say that I do. But we now know what took place on that call. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: We are bringing in witnesses this coming week from the National Security Council, other State Department officials, to find out what they can tell us about the conditionality of this vital military assistance to an ally. The conditionality of this vital meeting between the two presidents and the President's effort to dig up dirt on his opponent. MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, do you regret saying that we, the committee, weren't in touch with the whistleblower? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I should have been much more clear and I said so the minute it was brought to my attention that I was referring to the fact that when the whistleblower filed the complaint, we had not heard from the whistleblower. We wanted to bring the whistleblower in at that time. But I should've been much more clear about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you very much. And we will be right back. Stay with us. 13 (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up in our next half hour, the latest on the 2020 race for the White House. Who is up, who is down, and what impact the impeachment story is having if any on the Democratic field with our CBS News Battleground Tracker. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We spoke yesterday with Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz. He is the highest ranking U.S. official to visit Hong Kong since pro democracy protests began four months ago. We asked him about the President's saying that the situation in Hong Kong was dying down. SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas/@SenTedCruz): I'll tell you what's happening here in Hong Kong is inspiring. We've seen over two million people come to the streets standing up for freedom, standing up for democracy and-- and standing up against the oppression of the Chinese communist regime. And-- and I think it is very much in the United States' interest to support the people of Hong Kong. I'm here, I'm dressed in all black standing in solidarity with the protesters. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the protests are not dying out as the President suggested? SENATOR TED CRUZ: The protests are continuing full force, and I'll tell you something that really illustrates just how powerful the protests are is-- is what we've seen happen with the NBA this past week. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets--my hometown team, I'm a diehard Houston Rockets fan, but-- but he tweeted a very benign tweet where he said Stand for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong, and-- and the Chinese communist government, they just about lost it. They got so upset, they ended up boycotting the Rockets. They ended up pulling them off TV in China. They ended up pulling them off the internet. They ended up canceling all of their sponsorships. And, sadly, what ended up happening is the NBA as a league began this series of-- of apologies and it was really sad to see an American company and, indeed, a global sports league like the NBA being dragooned into censoring the free speech of American citizens in the interest of big bucks. It's not complicated why the NBA did that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR TED CRUZ: Television and-- and the Chinese market is worth a whole lot of money, but-- but, thankfully, a whole lot of us across the ideological spectrum--indeed I helped lead a group, a bipartisan group, of members of Congress calling on the NBA to do better to defend free speech-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR TED CRUZ: --and I am proud to say I-- I think the NBA is doing a better job of defending those free speech rights. 14 MARGARET BRENNAN: But isn't it really the U.S. government that should be leading the charge on this rather than free enterprise? SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well-- well, but-- but listen, American businesses shouldn't be in the business of censoring Americans and we've seen this pattern whether it's the NBA afraid of losing a bunch of money in China or whether it's Hollywood censoring out any content that is critical of the communist government in China. You know it's really an unfortunate dynamic how China uses it-- its vast resources to promote censorship. And all of our allies are facing this increased aggressiveness-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly-- SENATOR TED CRUZ: -- of China and we need to stand up. We need to defend our shared values. MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. So should those kind of protections be in any kind of trade deal with China? SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, listen, a trade deal is-- is functionally different. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee just unanimously passed legislation on Hong Kong to pressure-- to pressure China to protect the-- the free speech and democratic rights of the people of Hong Kong, that I am a co-sponsor of that legislation-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR TED CRUZ: --and it was bipartisan. We saw Republicans and Democrats come together. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're talking about legislation there. But what actions we've seen the Trump administration take about Muslim minorities who are being put in internment camps in China have been by the State Department-- SENATOR TED CRUZ: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --pretty limited. The Commerce Department blacklisted some companies. How do you stop the Trump administration from using that as a bargaining chip in a trade deal? SENATOR TED CRUZ: I introduced legislation called the Tiananmen Act to that-- that would direct blacklisting the technology companies--the Chinese technology companies that China is using to engage in surveillance, to engage in repression and imprisonment, and torture and murder of up to a million Uighurs, a religious minority. And-- and as you noted just this week, the Trump administration announced that they were implementing what is the core of my legislation which is blacklisting those Chinese technology companies that are being used to suppress religious minorities. I think that's a really good step. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they assured you-- SENATOR TED CRUZ: It's a positive step by the administration. 15 MARGARET BRENNAN: --that won't be in any way considered as a bargaining chip in negotiations? SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, listen, I-- I think we can do both. It's important to get a trade deal with China. I hope we do get a trade deal with China. We have enormous economic concerns, but we can do that at the same time defend our core values. MARGARET BRENNAN: China is a-- a surveillance state. Is it appropriate for President Trump to be saying-- SENATOR TED CRUZ: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --China should look into the Biden family? Is that appropriate? SENATOR TED CRUZ: I-- look, of course, not. Elections in the U.S. should be decided by-- by Americans and it's not the business of-- of foreign countries, any foreign countries, to be interfering in our elections. MARGARET BRENNAN: Even Ukraine? I mean, when-- when you're talking about some of this, I mean, do you think that-- say the President's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who's been talking about China, who's been talking about Ukraine. Do you want to hear him testify about this sort of shadow foreign policy? SENATOR TED CRUZ: Listen, foreign countries should stay out of American elections. That's true for Russia. That's true for Ukraine. That's true for China. That's true for all of them. It should be the American people deciding elections. I-- I don't know what Rudy's been saying. I-- I do know, though, that we should decide our elections. It should be the American people making those decisions. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you do want him to testify before your committee? SENATOR TED CRUZ: I-- I think it'd make a lot of sense for Rudy to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. That's-- that's ultimately a question for the Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. But-- but I'd like to see Rudy testify. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President is often talking about the need to look in to Joe Biden. If he is so concerned, would it be in any way appropriate for him to bring it to his own Justice Department instead of talking about foreign countries looking into his political rival? SENATOR TED CRUZ: I have long advocated that the Justice Department should enforce the law, should investigate corruption, should investigate violations of law, regardless of party. MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, you're not calling for the Justice Department to investigate the Biden family? SENATOR TED CRUZ: Look, I don't-- I-- I believe the Justice Department should investigate violations of law. If there's credible evidence of a violation of law, yes, they should investigate and I'll tell you what I have called for. I think President Trump wisely released the transcript of his conversation with the Ukrainian government. I think that was good because a lot of what the Democrats had been raising, alleging an illegal quid pro quo, was not, in fact, backed up by the  16 transcript. But I think-- I think actually the administration should do the exact same thing for Joe Biden. That it should release the transcripts of Joe Biden's conversations with Ukraine. Use the same standard for President Trump and Joe Biden and-- and let the American people read the transcripts and decide. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cruz, we will leave it there. Thank you for joining us from Hong Kong. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look at what Americans are thinking about all those headlines that are dominating our conversations here on FACE THE NATION, we turn to Anthony Salvanto, our CBS News elections and survey directors. Anthony has got two polls for us today. And, first, we'll take a look at the national poll on the impeachment inquiry. So, Anthony, over the past two weeks since this has really picked up steam, have you seen a change? ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections & Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Not over the last two weeks. We do see hardening partisan divisions here. We see Republicans increasingly saying that they support the President. Don't think he ought to cooperate with Congress. Democrats even more strongly approving of the inquiry. Really important when you watch the polls on this is that you differentiate between support for having an inquiry, which there is marginal majority support, get the facts, learn what happened and whether or not they think the President deserves impeachment. And that is much more mixed nationally. What I think is interesting going forward here, Margaret, is that when you talk to the people who say they don't know which way to go on this, they say they aren't paying as much attention and they feel like a lot of this, lot of names, a lot of places are hard to follow. So it may be a challenge for both parties to move beyond their base as they make their arguments when Congress returns. MARGARET BRENNAN: So over-standing things to say building support for impeachment, it's more complicated than that. ANTHONY SALVANTO: It's more complicated than that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Our second survey is of Democrats in the eighteen states holding the first primary or caucus contest next year. According to our CBS News Battleground Tracker, Senator Elizabeth Warren has extended her lead with thirty-one percent support among Democrats, former Vice President Joe Biden is second with twenty-five percent support, and Senator Bernie Sanders rounds out the top tier with seventeen percent. Our next group of candidates shows Senator Kamala Harris with seven percent support, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has five percent support among voters in those eighteen early contests, and former Congressman Beto O'Rourke has four percent support. The other candidates come in with one percent or less. So how, Anthony, is all of this controversy affecting the Democrats? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, the charges of the President's leveled against Joe Biden. They are not hurting him directly. Most Democrats say they aren't true, they don't matter, haven't changed their views of him. But it's Biden's response to those charges that's generating, kind of, a lukewarm response from these early-state Democrats. They say they are somewhat satisfied with that Biden response, but not very satisfied with it. And then we ask, well, when these  17 candidates-- if these candidates become the nominee, how well would they be able to fend off attacks from the President? MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Because surely they are going to be coming. And only half of people say that they think Biden will do that very well. You contrast that with Elizabeth Warren whose numbers are much higher on her perceived ability to fend off attacks from the President. I also notice that one of the strengths for Joe Biden has been what people perceive as his electability, the idea that he can beat Donald Trump among Democrats. That's down this week. And so I think it maybe that, you know, when you talk about electability it's not just which demographic groups they think a candidate can appeal to, it's also how they rate the way they handle the campaign. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said Elizabeth Warren has had a good month. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what's behind that? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, she is up in across these early states. She's also then moved up in Iowa, extended her lead in New Hampshire. And a lot of that is she is doing particularly well with people who say they want a candidate who is tough. Her electability numbers have stayed about where they were. She is also doing much better than Joe Biden in being perceived as a candidate who will fight for people like you. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's her slogan, isn't it? ANTHONY SALVANTO: That's one of her-- it's one of her slogan. So that may be resonating. And I think a lot of this for her too is, you know, not just on policy now, not just on being seen as specific which she has been in previous polls. But she also seems to undercutting some of Joe Biden's arguments as well as she gains steam. MARGARET BRENNAN: The other frontrunner, Bernie Sanders, has had a tough month in terms of health problems. He had that heart attack. Is that impacting perception of him? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, we have been asking now and in previous polls if folks thought age was a concern for some of these older candidates. And the numbers who say that Sanders' age is a concern are up this week. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTHONY SALVANTO: We followed up and we asked what, specifically, is concerning. And it was those folks who said it was said, well, they were worried that he might not be able to do the job of President and all that it requires. So there may be some indirect impact on that for Sanders. Having said that the support he does have, the folks who support him are among the strongest are the strongest, in fact, in their support of any other candidate. MARGARET BRENNAN: The passion factor. 18 ANTHONY SALVANTO: Indeed. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Anthony, thank you. All of the results from both of those surveys are now on our website at facethenation.com. And we will be back in a moment with our panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'd like to bring in our panel now for some political analysis. Amy Walter is the national editor for The Cook Political Report, Jerry Seib is the executive Washington editor at The Wall Street Journal, and Tolu Olorunnipa covers the White House for The Washington Post. He is also a CNN political analyst. Thank you all for being here. Jerry, I want to start off with you, just the news of the morning. What we heard from the secretary of Defense. The pull out of at least hundreds of-- GERALD SEIB (Wall Street Journal/@GeraldFSeib): Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --American troops from the north of the country. Unclear when the remaining will be moved out. It sounds like they are first headed to Iraq. Unclear what the plan is-- GERALD SEIB: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --to counter the counterterrorism threat. How is this going to be digested? GERALD SEIB: Well, first of all, it's striking how ugly this has turned how quickly. You have Turkish troops moving further into Syria than they promised. You have ISIS prisoners on the loose, apparently. You have U.S. troops getting out of harm's way because they were, in fact, in harm's way. You have a lot of tension within the NATO alliance because you have a NATO ally, a NATO member undertaking an action that everybody, including the U.S., opposes. And so that's a pretty ugly picture. I also think, though, it's striking that you have President Trump saying this is an-- an attempt to end endless wars. And it kind of tells you exactly how seriously he took this promise he thinks he made in the 2016 (sic) campaign to get U.S. forces out of the Middle East and how intent he is on not being accused of failing to make good on that promise by time the 2020 campaign gets around. Makes you wonder a little bit about what's going to happen in Iraq and Afghanistan between now and the 2020 election. AMY WALTER (Cook Political Report/@amyewalter/The Takeaway): Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we didn't even mention the fact that on Friday the Pentagon announced they're actually upping the number of U.S. troops in the Middle East. This isn't actually withdrawing from the region-- AMY WALTER: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --it's adding another eighteen thousand-- or eighteen hundred, excuse me, to Saudi Arabia. 19 AMY WALTER: But I think Jerry's right. It's a little bit of the check the box, right? The closer that we get to the election the more that he focuses on being able to say I fulfilled the promises I made in 2016. The-- the lengths he's taken on security, on the border, right, building the wall, showing how many folks have been apprehended at the border. We're now I think on our fifth Homeland Security head since the-- his administration has started. MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin McAleenan-- AMY WALTER: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the acting secretary resigned on Friday. AMY WALTER: Resigned. So with the sole focus of that position which was designed as a broader umbrella for security, right, an American security and coordinating security within the U.S. has been focused almost exclusively on the southern border. And his-- the President's focus on making sure that he can say on Election Day I have been able to fulfill X, Y and Z. GERALD SEIB: And-- and we should not lose sight of the fact that a lot of people will cheer at that. AMY WALTER: Yes, of course. GERALD SEIB: I mean the foreign policy establishment is appalled but there is a certain base of support for just-- let's just get out and he's going to tap into that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tolu, obviously, the promise resonates to pull U.S. troops out of the Middle East because Democrats are also running on that message. TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA (Washington Post/@ToluseO): Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's the how it happens when it happens if it's planned, that is what the national security establishment-- TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA: Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --usually tries to plan to minimize damage. What we heard from the defense secretary is all of this was decided just last night. TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA: Yeah. I thought it was pretty remarkable what Secretary Esper said. He said that we predicted that all of this negative and horrible stuff would happen once the Turks went into Syria, but we still stood down and allowed it to happen. It doesn't make it sound better to say that we knew that this was going to happen but we thought, you know, we could not stop them from doing it. We have the President that says, you know, we're America first, we're the strongest military, we've rebuilt the military but at the same time we can prevent these atrocities from happening. We just had to stand down because the Turks were determined to go in, it didn't seem like there was a plan about what to do once that happened. Now it seems like they're trying to put together a plan, President's tweeting and threatening sanctions. But there's not a clear sense that there is a strategy involved and we saw what happened in 2014 with the rise of ISIS and how well they used social media to really put fear in the hearts of a lot of  20 Americans and a lot of American voters and Republicans use that as a weapon against President Obama and if we see that reemerge, if we see those types of videos and images coming out of the region once again they could threaten President Trump's reelection as well. AMY WALTER: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: So it-- it's usually thought of it as a cliche, oh, foreign policy doesn't matter to voters, national security doesn't. AMY WALTER: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that true? AMY WALTER: Unless it doesn't until it does. And Tolu is right. When it looks like it's directly impacting Americans that's when-- that's when it really matters. But I also think it's important to-- to understand when we're talking about fulfilling his campaign promises and checking those boxes and I think Jerry is right that, yes, for a lot of voters they do think that's one of the things that they like about him. But, remember, there is this whole group of voters out there who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 not necessarily because they liked what he was saying or they wanted him to fulfill these promises, but they didn't necessarily like the other choice that they had. Now what they're having to choose from and I think this is an example of this is do they want another four years of a presidency where things seem to happen without any strategic thinking, where there's so much chaos. The Wall Street Journal editorial-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMY WALTER: --put it this way, right, this impulsive judgment, that is the challenge right now for Trump going forward. It's not-- is his base excited, our-- Democrats engaged, it's that small sliver of people who might not necessarily have been enamored with Donald Trump in the first place, but they are exhausted by what's been happening over these last couple of years and the prospect of it continuing. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to-- I want to talk about one of the people who's running as an alternative, Joe Biden, who has been linked to this impeachment inquiry because the accusations around Ukraine and his son. His son, Hunter, today releasing a statement really kind of commenting for the first time on all of this saying that if his pres-- his father becomes President he won't serve on the board of a foreign firm, resigning from the firm he does serve on in-- in China. And I want to play this sound bite from the Vice President Joe Biden because he really responded for one of the first times this week. JOE BIDEN: We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It's no joke. He's shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it. (Crowd cheering) JOE BIDEN: To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached. MARGARET BRENNAN: So that public call was really the first time the vice president has said  21 he's-- he's putting his shoulder behind it. GERALD SEIB: And he's been very cautious about impeachment as a lot of mainstream Democrats have been, like, let's-- we saw this movie in the 1980s with Bill Clinton that didn't turn out well for the Republicans, let's be careful. But he came out this week, it puts him more in sync with the Democratic base. And now I think that Biden campaign is doing something very interesting, they are trying to say, essentially, President Trump is trying to drag me, Joe Biden, down because he fears me the most. And that plays right into the Biden campaign narrative, which is I am the most formidable candidate to defeat President Trump. President Trump is making that case for me, you Democrats ought to take heed and understand that I am the formidable candidate who you can turn to-- to defeat President Trump. That's not a bad message for the Biden campaign to put out. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Tolu, how is the White House, how is the President responding to the impeachment inquiry? We can see the tweets what's actually happened. TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA: Well, as we talked about they're not being much of a strategy with the Syria policy. It doesn't seem like there's much of a counter impeachment strategy beyond, you know, having these outside lawyers say that the President is immune, that the President should not be investigated, the President going out doing more rallies than normal and saying that this is a coup, that this is an-- an attempt by Democrats to overturn the 2016 election. So he's going to push forward some language that may seem unsettling to a lot of people as he tries to counter this impeachment inquiry, but there's no sense that there's an actual strategy a war room within the White House to push back against any of this. MARGARET BRENNAN: And how is it landing? AMY WALTER: Well, I think the point that your recent poll just put forward is that the Biden defense that this is actually good for me, this makes me look like the frontrunner and that Trump's afraid of me isn't really borne out by those numbers how well they handle attacks from Trump-Warren up over Biden by fifteen points. So I think that as of this point it has not been as effective as they would have liked it to be. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thanks to all of you. We'll be right back with a report from Syria. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We close today with a look at the situation in Syria from CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata, who just filed this report from northern Syria. (Begin VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA (CBS News Foreign Correspondent/@charliecbs): Even before the announcement of the withdrawal of U.S. troops, America's Kurdish allies stood little defense against Turkey's relentless onslaught. The U.S. military presence here was the only thing stopping the Turks from attacking in the first place, now there will be no holding back. Turkish-backed militias who have already penetrated deeper into northeast Syria than ever before will be emboldened to broaden their ground offensive. This video allegedly shows their gunmen  22 executing Kurdish civilians and soldiers on the roadside. The Syrian Democratic Forces say they've been betrayed and abandoned. Senior SDF commander Redur Khalil. What is your message to President Trump? (Redur Khalil speaking foreign language) CHARLIE D'AGATA: \"We fought beside his soldiers for many years,\" Khalil told us, \"We were brothers in arms. He promised that he would protect the Kurds, but he's done nothing.\" The U.N. estimates that more than a hundred thirty thousand Kurds have already fled the fighting. What is your message to President Trump? (Woman speaking foreign language) CHARLIE D'AGATA: \"Why did you leave us alone?\" she said, \"we were your loyal allies and you turned your back on us.\" These Kurdish forces were not only America's most loyal allies in the fight against ISIS here, but they protected us as we covered that fight. With Kurdish forces redeployed to face the Turkish invasion and U.S. troops now largely out of the picture, resurgent ISIS has already begun striking back in any way they can. Now that emerging ISIS threat cannot be exaggerated, they used a car bomb in an attempted jailbreak not far from here. ISIS inmates have been rioting. And just this morning hundreds of ISIS families and supporters escaped from a detention center after it was shelled by Turkish forces. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Charlie D'Agata reporting from northern Syria. That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. And thank you to the Jones Day law firm for the use of their facilities here on Capitol Hill. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "Here's what you need to know in politics this week... ALL EYES ON LOUISIANA Via CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro:\u00a0The Trump administration is pulling out all the stops ahead of Louisiana's gubernatorial election. Vice President Mike Pence spoke at a GOP Unity rally in the state on Saturday, and President Trump\u00a0Tweeted on Sunday\u00a0that he'd hold a rally the day before the October 12 \"jungle primary.\" Louisiana does not have traditional primaries, so there is no Republican nominee yet. Instead, Congressman Ralph Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, who are both Republicans, are hoping to keep incumbent Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards to under 50% of the vote. If Bel Edwards manages to get a majority of the vote he will avoid a runoff election. But if he comes in under 50%, he'll face whoever finishes second in Saturday's election.\u00a0 During his visit to the state, Pence didn't endorse either Rispone or Abraham, who both spoke at the event and have been airing attack ads at each other in the past few weeks. \"Louisiana said yes to Trump in 2016 and we need Louisiana to send a Republican to the governor's office and for Louisiana to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump,\" Pence said.\u00a0 In a statement to CBS News,\u00a0a spokesman for Edward's campaign said \"it's no surprise that the president is supporting members of his own political party.\" \"This last-minute rally is proof that the partisan forces in Washington realize that Gov. Edwards is supported by a wide range of people in Louisiana, from every political party and every background...Gov. Edwards will keep putting people over politics in his second term,\" Edwards spokesman Eric Holl said.\u00a0Early election\u00a0returns show Democrats with a one-percent lead in turnout as of Sunday morning. BERNIE SANDERS ALLY SAYS \"HE'S FINE\" Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga: Hours before Senator Bernie Sanders returned to his Burlington home Saturday to recover from a heart attack,\u00a0Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the mayor of the Puerto Rican capital of San Juan, campaigned through New Hampshire\u00a0in his place. At a town hall in Nashua, the mayor shared news of Sanders' health. \"By the way, he's fine. I spoke to him yesterday. He's rather ticked off that he's off the campaign trail. But he's had our back, and now we have to have his,\" Cruz remarked before sliding into a Spanish translation. Sanders was admitted to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center in Paradise, Nevada, on Tuesday after suffering chest pains. His diagnosis, described by the campaign as \"blockage in one artery\" was revealed three days later to be \"a myocardial infarction,\" the medical name for a heart attack. Asked if the delay in diagnosis was a point of concern, Cruz told CBS News, \"If there was something to be concerned about, he would have been open with the American people.\" She continued. \"Because he wants most from us, is to have that new relationship that a person who is in public office should have. Not one of being deceitful like President Trump. Not one of lying, like President Trump. But one of honesty and integrity.\" Sanders had been scheduled for a New Hampshire swing next weekend, with meetings and at least one public event on October 12 and 13. The Sanders campaign has said that the candidate will return to the trail in time for the October 15 Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio. TRUMP HEADS TO MINNESOTA\u00a0 Via CBS News Associate Producer Eleanor Watson: President Trump is heading to Minnesota this week for a Thursday campaign rally in a state where his campaign says it's on offense in 2020.\u00a0 Mr. Trump narrowly lost the state in 2016 but exceeded expectations in the process. Minnesota currently has the longest record of voting Democratic in presidential elections and was the only state that stayed blue in President Reagan's 49-state landslide in 1984. The last Republican to win Minnesota was Richard Nixon in 1972. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said at a meeting in June that if he was Mr. Trump, he would be targeting Minnesota as ground zero. In July, Mr. Trump\u00a0tweeted\u00a0that he will win the state in 2020. The president has also been in a long-running feud with Ilhan Omar, a prominent Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota and a fierce critic of the administration.\u00a0 The 2018 midterms made the state even more intriguing. Republicans and Democrats both flipped the two congressional districts. Democrats still control five out of the eight districts in the state. \u00a0 Record fundraising allows the campaign to look at expanding on the number of states Mr. Trump won in 2016. Minnesota will be the third state he lost in 2016 where Mr. Trump and his campaign are hosting a rally. He has already held rallies in New Mexico and New Hampshire. KAMALA HARRIS WANTS PENCE TO TESTIFY Via CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell: Kamala Harris wrapped her eleventh trip to South Carolina with a town hall where she spoke about impeachment. When asked why Democrats are pursuing an investigation that may not lead to Mr. Trump's removal from office, Harris replied that the impeachment process \"is about defending the design of our democracy\" and that \"it may not end in a guilty verdict in the Senate but at least we would have been true to the system and the design of our democracy.\"\u00a0 Speaking to reporters later, Harris was pressed on whether she wants to see the vice president testify, to which she replied, \"I do, under oath.\" Harris continued, \"If he has information or in fact was involved and complicit or facilitated the\u2014a head of a foreign nation to somehow attempt to manipulate our elections. Absolutely.\" Addressing a crowd of at least 200 in Bluffton, Harris was asked what she thought former Vice President Joe Biden had done for communities of color. The California senator, who received some backlash after\u00a0confronting\u00a0Biden over race during the first Democratic presidential debate, skirted around the question.\u00a0 \"I agree with the first point that you made, which is that he has been a dedicated public servant and that he should not be impugned,\" said Harris. \"He has done very good work in his career and he has done work that has benefitted all communities including the African-American community.\"\u00a0 When reminded of her comments toward Biden during the first debate regarding busing, Harris responded that while they disagreed on that one specific issue, \"that doesn't mean that you paint a whole cloth against the vice president in terms of where he stands on all issues that relate to the African-American community.\" During the same meeting with reporters, Mitchell asked Harris if three days was too long for Sen. Bernie Sanders' team to release that he'd had a heart attack, and whether the heart attack may speak to his overall fitness. Harris replied that she wouldn't second-guess Sanders' decisions, \"I know him to be a fighter and have no reason to think he's not going to fight this.\" GET THAT MONEY, AMY KLOBUCHAR Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga: Amy Klobuchar previewed her unreleased third-quarter fundraising numbers in Manchester, New Hampshire on Sunday. \"We feel good about our number. I think we've raised a million more from what we did last quarter.\"\u00a0 The Klobuchar campaign raised $3.87 million in the second quarter. \"We have money in the bank. That's why we're putting out ads,\" the Minnesota senator added. Taking a swipe\u00a0at Senator Cory Booker's threat to leave the race if he didn't quickly raise money in September, Klobuchar said, \"People are going to have different fundraising pitches. I wouldn't have used that one. You know why? Because I am staying into this race until the end. And I'm not going to put out threats about getting out of it. But I guess that worked for him to raise some money. That's just how it is.\" Klobuchar also released her Veterans Plan on Sunday, which focused on reducing wait times at the Veterans Administration, access to \"telehealth\" services in rural areas and investing in Alzheimer's, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and ALS research.\u00a0 Klobuchar said her plan would bring together service members from across geographic and political lines, touting her legislative successes in the Senate. \"I am the queen of bridging the urban\u2013rural divide,\" she said.\u00a0 THE BLUE JAMBOREE Via CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell: Seven presidential candidates were in Charleston this weekend for the Charleston Democratic Party's 10th annual Blue Jamboree. Mitchell\u00a0spoke\u00a0with CBSN anchor Reena Ninan to discuss the McDonald's workers' #Fightfor15 strike that took place during the event, what the presidential candidates said, and why Charleston County will be important ahead of 2020.

            "article_content": "For 15 years, presidents have sat for interviews ahead of the Super Bowl, a tradition that began when CBS sportscaster Jim Nantz\u00a0interviewed\u00a0then-President George W. Bush in 2004. On Friday afternoon, President Trump spoke with \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan in the Blue Room of the White House. The president, who is preparing to deliver the State of the Union address on Tuesday, discussed the fight over border security funding, his disagreements with the intelligence community, the situation in Venezuela and the fight against ISIS in Syria. The interview airs on \"Face the Nation\" at 10:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. before the Super Bowl on CBS. After\u00a0U.S. intelligence chiefs seemed to be at odds with Mr. Trump on several topics during\u00a0congressional testimony\u00a0last week, he called them naive and suggested\u00a0they might need to go back to \"school.\" But on \"Face the Nation,\" the president indicated it was more the \"questions and answers\" about the worldwide threats report that troubled him, and he went on to tout the success of U.S. efforts around the globe.\u00a0 \"You have the caliphate almost knocked out,\" he said. \"We will be announcing in the not too distant future 100 percent of the caliphate, which is the area \u2014 the land \u2014 the area, 100. We're at 99 percent right now, we'll be at 100,\" Mr. Trump said. Specifically on the threat posed by Iran, Mr. Trump still appeared to doubt the intelligence. \"My intelligence people, if they said in fact that Iran is a wonderful kindergarten, I disagree with them 100 percent. It is a vicious country that kills many people,\" he said.\u00a0 When pressed on the intelligence community's assessment that Iran was technically in compliance with the Iran nuclear deal, Trump said he doesn't \"have to agree\" with his intelligence chiefs. \"I have intel people, but that doesn't mean I have to agree. President Bush had intel people that said Saddam Hussein in Iraq had nuclear weapons, had all sorts of weapons of mass destruction. Guess what? Those intel people didn't know what the hell they were doing, and they got us tied up in a war that we should have never been in.\" He added, \"We were in many, many locations in the Middle East, in huge difficulty. Every single one of them was caused by the number one terrorist nation in the world which is Iran. So when my intelligence people tell me how wonderful Iran is \u2014 if you don't mind, I'm going to just go by my own counsel.\" Mr. Trump said he wouldn't stop his intelligence chiefs from testifying again, saying, \"I want them to have their own opinion and I want them to give me their opinion.\" Brennan pointed out the president's intelligence chiefs had said that a vacuum left by the departure of U.S. troops could result in a resurgence of ISIS or al Qaeda in Syria or Iraq. \"And you know what we'll do? We'll come back if we have to,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have very fast airplanes, we have very good cargo planes. We can come back very quickly, and I'm not leaving. We have a base in Iraq and the base is a fantastic edifice. I mean I was there recently, and I couldn't believe the money that was spent on these massive runways. And these \u2014 I've rarely seen anything like it. And it's there. And we'll be there.\"\u00a0 He went on to say he'd keep troops in Iraq to be able to \"watch Iran.\" \"Well, we spent a fortune on building this incredible base. We might as well keep it. And one of the reasons I want to keep it is because I want to be looking a little bit at Iran because Iran is a real problem,\" he said. \"We're going to keep watching and we're going to keep seeing and if there's trouble, if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we're going to know it before they do.\" Mr. Trump told Brennan that 2,000 troops remain in Syria, but they are starting to come home, as they push out the \"final remainder of the caliphate.\" Afterward, he said, \"they will be going to our base in Iraq, and ultimately, some will be coming home.\" He said planned to keep a small contingent of troops in Afghanistan\u00a0for \"real intelligence\" purposes. \"I'll leave intelligence there and if I see nests forming, I'll do something about it.\" He was emphatic, however, about bringing troops home.\u00a0 \"We've been there for 19 years. I want to fight. I want to win, and we want to bring our great troops back home. I've seen the people. I go to Walter Reed Hospital. I see what happens to people. I see with no legs and no arms. And I've seen also what happens to them up here because they're in this situation, and they come back and they are totally different people,\" he said. \"Where the wives and the fathers and the mothers say, 'What has happened to my son? What has happened' \u2014 in some cases \u2014 'to my daughter?' It's a terrible thing. We've been there close to 19 years. And it's time. And we'll see what happens with the Taliban. They want peace. They're tired. Everybody's tired. We'd like to have \u2014 I don't like endless wars.\" Mr. Trump also discussed the crisis in Venezuela, saying the use of military force remains \"an option.\" The country's\u00a0President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0is holding onto power as the U.S. and dozens of other countries have thrown their support behind Juan Guaid\u00f3, the head of the Venezuelan National Assembly. The president told Brennan Maduro requested a meeting with him \"a number of months ago.\" \"I've turned it down because we're very far along in the process,\" he said. Mr. Trump explained why he turned down the meeting with the embattled Venezuelan leader, who has seen the economic crisis in the country dramatically worsen under his leadership, and whose re-election last year was widely regarded as tainted. \"I would say this. I decided at the time, no, because so many really horrible things have been happening in Venezuela, when you look at that country,\" he said. \"That was the wealthiest country of all in that part of the world, which is a very important part of the world. And now you look at the poverty, and you look at the anguish, and you look at the crime and you look at all of the things happening.\" Less than two weeks before some parts of the government will again see their funding lapse, Mr. Trump is now not ruling out another government shutdown. Asked directly whether he'd consider such a move again, Mr. Trump said, \"Well, we're going to have to see what happens on Feb. 15.\" However, he quickly pivoted to another alternative \u2014 declaring a national emergency at the border, which would enable him to fund the construction of a border wall without congressional approval. \"It's a national emergency, it's other things and, you know, there have been plenty national emergencies called,\" he said. \"You need a wall. And anybody that says you don't, they're just playing games.\" Mr. Trump criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0for her negotiating tactics in this fight. Pelosi has firmly insisted the House will not agree to increased funding for the wall. \"She can keep playing her games, but we will win,\" he said. \"Because we have a much better issue. On a political basis, what she's doing is \u2014 I actually think it's bad politics, but much more importantly it's very bad for our country.\" Mr. Trump dismissed reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would consider running for Senate from Kansas. He said he asked Pompeo, who he said told him he's \"absolutely not leaving.\"\u00a0 Still, Brennan pointed out that the president has an unusually large number of interim personnel in top positions in his administration, with an acting attorney general, chief of staff, defense secretary and interior secretary.\u00a0 \"It's OK. It's easier to make moves when they're acting,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I like acting because I can move so quickly. It gives me more flexibility.\" Asked when he knows it's time to fire someone, Mr. Trump said, \"When it's not happening ... when it doesn't get done.\" Without prompting, he pointed to his former defense secretary, James Mattis. \"Like with General Mattis, I wasn't happy with his service. I told him, 'Give me a letter,'\" he told Brennan, who pointed out that Mattis had resigned. \"He resigned because I asked him to resign,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He resigned because I was very nice to him. But I gave him big budgets and he didn't do well in Afghanistan. I was not happy with the job he was doing in Afghanistan. And if you look at Syria what's happened. I went to Iraq recently, if you look at Syria, what's happened in Syria in the last few weeks, you would see that things are going down that were not going down. That things are happening that are very good. So I was not happy with him, but I wish him well.\"",

            "article_content": "A proposal inspired by President Donald Trump's refusal to release his tax returns advanced Tuesday in Washington state. A bill in the state Legislature would require candidates to release five years of returns before they could appear on either the primary or general election ballot in the state. Senators approved the bill on a 28-21 vote Tuesday, sending it to the House. \"Although releasing tax returns has been the norm for about the last 40 years in presidential elections, unfortunately we've seen that norm broken,\" said bill sponsor Sen. Patty Kuderer, a Bellevue Democrat, during debate Tuesday. Kuderer later confirmed she was referring to Trump. How a candidate has handled their own financial affairs and personal investments are relevant details for voters choosing a commander-in-chief, Kuderer added. \"It's become part of the vetting process,\" Kuderer said later. Kuderer's proposal would apply only to candidates for president and vice president. Presidents as far back as Richard Nixon have released their tax returns either during their campaigns or after being elected. Trump initially promised to release his returns, but then reversed himself, pointing to an audit by the Internal Revenue Service, although experts and IRS officials have said audits don't prohibit taxpayers from releasing their own returns. Trump's tax returns would contain information on his sources of income, how much he earned, and any strategies he used to reduce his tax bill. But critics warned enacting the Washington proposal would invite an expensive legal fight, politicize the administration of elections, and put the state in an untenable position if a candidate defied the rule. \"We're on really risky ground when we're trying to place conditions on a federal election,\" said Sen. Hans Zeiger, a Republican from Puyallup. Some also expressed a deeper unease with forcing candidates into transparency, and warned legislators could see the same expectation turned back on themselves in future elections. \"I just don't understand why in the world you would promote something that would connote that there's something suspicious about the activities of our elected officials,\" said Sen. Maureen Walsh, R-Walla Walla. At least 25 states have proposed similar bills in recent years according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, spurring wide debate over whether states have the Constitutional authority to make such rules. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that states cannot add to the qualifications of senators and congressional representatives outlined in the Constitution. But legal experts have said the law is at least partly unclear, since the Constitution also gives states the power to set rules for how presidential elections are held within their borders. In an advisory letter issued before Tuesday's vote, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson and solicitor general Noah Purcell told lawmakers they thought the proposal was legal. \"The disclosure requirement you propose is likely Constitutional,\" the pair wrote. But the pair added in the same letter that because of the many possible interpretations of the law, if it passed the bill \"would definitely be challenged in court.\" In addition to requiring candidates to turn over their tax returns, the bill would also direct the Secretary of State to post them publicly. New Jersey lawmakers approved a similar measure in 2017, but Republican Gov. Chris Christie vetoed it, calling a political stunt.",

            "article_content": "Moscow\u00a0\u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin called the U.S. impeachment process \"far-fetched\" Thursday, making a seemingly obvious prediction that Donald Trump will be acquitted in the Senate. Putin said Thursday at his annual news conference in Moscow that the move is a continuation of the Democrats' fight against Mr. Trump.  \"The party that lost the (2016) election, the Democratic Party, is trying to achieve results by other means,\" Putin said.  He likened Mr. Trump's impeachment to the earlier U.S. probe into collusion with Russia, which Putin downplayed as being groundless. Putin noted that the impeachment motion \"is yet to pass the Senate where the Republicans have a majority.\" He added that \"they will be unlikely to remove a representative of their own party from office on what seems to me an absolutely far-fetched reason.\" Mr. Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming only the third American chief executive to be formally charged under the Constitution's ultimate remedy for high crimes and misdemeanors. The historic vote split along party lines Wednesday night in the U.S., much the way it has divided the nation, over a charge that the 45th president abused the power of his office by enlisting a foreign government to investigate a political rival ahead of the 2020 election. The House then approved a second charge, that he obstructed Congress in its investigation. The articles of impeachment, the political equivalent of an indictment, now go to the Senate for trial. Putin earlier opened the marathon news conference on another topic, saying that global climate change poses new challenges to Russia. He said that global warming could threaten Russian Arctic cities and towns built on permafrost. The Russian leader added that climate changes could trigger fires, devastating floods and other negative consequences. Putin emphasized that Russia has abided by the Paris agreement intended to slow down global warming. At the same time, he noted that factors behind global climate change have remained unknown and hard to predict. \"Nobody knows the origins of global climate change,\" he said as he began his news conference. \"We know that in the history of our Earth there have been periods of warming and cooling and it could depend on processes in the universe.\" Putin, who has been in power for two decades, also hailed the economic achievements of his rule. He emphasized that Russia has become the world's largest grain exporter, surpassing the U.S. and Canada \u2014 a dramatic change compared to the Soviet Union that heavily depended on grain imports. The Russian leader also pointed at industry modernization, saying that three quarters of industrial equipment is no older than 12 years. He said that the country has built three new airports, 12 new railway stations and the number of major highways has doubled. The Russian economy had suffered a double blow of a drop in global oil prices and Western sanctions that followed\u00a0Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea. It has seen a slow recovery since 2017 after a two-year stagnation. Russia's ties with the West have remained at post-Cold War lows, and Western penalties have continued to stymie the country's economic growth. Putin voiced hope for further moves to settle the conflict in eastern Ukraine following his talks in Paris on Dec. 9 with the leaders of Ukraine, France and Germany. He said that the 2015 peace agreement signed in Minsk and brokered by France and Germany must be observed, rejecting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's push for revising it.  The fighting in eastern Ukraine that flared up in 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea has killed more than 14,000 and ravaged Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. The Minsk deal envisaged that Ukraine can regain control over the border with Russia in the separatist-held regions only after they are granted broad self-rule and hold local elections. The agreement was a diplomatic coup for Russia, ensuring that the rebel regions get a broad authority and resources to survive on their own without cross-border support. Zelenskiy pushed for tweaking the timeline laid out in the accord so that Ukraine gets control of its border first before local elections are held, but Putin firmly rejected that. \"There is nothing but the Minsk agreement,\" Putin said. \"If we start revising the Minsk agreement, it will lead to deadlock.\"",

            "article_content": "Embattled former judge and one-time Senate candidate Roy Moore is throwing his hat back into the ring and running for Senate in Alabama, looking to defeat incumbent Doug Jones. Moore, a Republican, narrowly lost to Jones in a 2017 special election to fill former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' vacant Senate seat.\u00a0 \"I fought for our country in Vietnam. I fought for our country and its laws as Chief Justice. I fought for morality to preserve its moral institutions. And I'm ready to do it again. And yes, I will run for the United States Senate in 2020,\" Moore said at a press conference in Montgomery on Thursday. \"Can I win? Yes, I can win.\" During his Thursday press conference, Moore said he would continue to \"stand up for the U.S. Constitution, stronger border security\" and the \"right to keep and bear arms.\" Taking a page out of President Trump's playbook, Moore also lambasted Democrats for carrying out what he claimed was \"evidence of intent to disrupt a state Senate race.\" He said such \"collusion\" by Democratic operatives in Washington would not be tolerated and claimed Jones was the \"beneficiary of election hacking.\" Moore's 2017 campaign was widely condemned by both Republicans and Democrats after numerous women came forward with detailed claims of sexual misconduct against Moore when he was a judge. Moore denied any wrongdoing. Once the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Moore has been removed from the bench twice. The first removal came after he defied a federal judge's order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building. Then, after he was elected again, a judicial discipline panel permanently suspended Moore in 2016, ruling that he urged probate judges to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples in defiance of the federal courts. \u00a0 Moore later faced off against Luther Strange in the Alabama primary. Despite video surfacing of Moore saying at a speech shortly before the primary that \"we have blacks and whites fighting, reds and yellows fighting, Democrats and Republicans fighting, men and women fighting,\" Moore defeated Strange, who had been endorsed by President Trump.  But it was the multitude of sexual misconduct allegations that further tarnished his less-than-glowing career, leading to his narrow loss in the 2017 special election. Several women came forward during Moore's campaign alleging he had touched or kissed them inappropriately when they were teens and he was an adult.  Moore repeatedly denied he ever made unwanted sexual advances to teenage girls, chalking up the accusations to \"dirty politics.\" \"We see malicious and false attacks which reflect the immorality of our time,\" Moore said at a rally in the final days of his campaign. Despite his second shot at the Senate, Moore has been dealt an early blow by Mr. Trump, who suggested last month Moore can't win the Senate seat.  \"Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama,\" the president tweeted. \"This time it will be for Six Years, not just Two. I have NOTHING against Roy Moore, and unlike many other Republican leaders, wanted him to win. But he didn't, and probably won't. ... If Alabama does not elect a Republican to the Senate in 2020, many of the incredible gains that we have made during my Presidency may be lost, including our Pro-Life victories. Roy Moore cannot win, and the consequences will be devastating....Judges and Supreme Court Justices!\" Mr. Trump endorsed Moore's 2017 campaign, despite the sexual misconduct allegations. The RNC had been reluctant to back him, but eventually conceded and threw their support behind him. Mr. Trump even recorded a robocall and tweeted on the day of the election \"Vote Roy Moore!\" In an interview with CBS News Washington correspondent Major Garrett at Mr. Trump's reelection campaign launch in Orlando this week, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said, \"Look, we'd be \u2014 hav[ing] the best candidate [in] Alabama would be the best thing we could have,\" but refused to say if that candidate could be Moore.  Moore, meanwhile, has been confident in his second attempt at political office. The candidate, who said back in March we was \"seriously considering\" another run, tweeted late last month that if he did indeed run, he would beat Jones.  A poll of Alabama Republicans in April showed Moore leading with 27%, with Reps. Mo Brooks, Bradley Byrne and Gary Palmer trailing just behind him.  But the Republican Party continues to minimize Moore's political ambitions, painting the Alabaman as underperforming Mr. Trump in each county by an average of 10 points, according to a Republican strategist.  Republicans are also reportedly wary that Moore's second shot could potentially boost Democratic turnout. African American voters, who make up a sizable portion of the Alabama Democratic party, voted overwhelmingly for Jones 96 percent to four percent, and African American voters made up three in ten voters in 2017, according to a CBS News exit poll. With his win, defeating Moore by a margin of just over 21,000 votes, Jones became the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in the deeply red state since 1992. Jones took Thursday's announcement as a fundraising opportunity, telling supporters on social media simply: \"Roy Moore? Really? Here we go again.\" Roy Moore? Really? Here we go again \ud83d\ude44\n\nSign up, volunteer, donate, let's do this. The Republican primary is set for March 3, 2020.\u00a0GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne and former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville have already announced they'll be running, and more Republican candidates could jump in.\u00a0 In a statement released shortly after Moore's announcement, Byrne's campaign manager called the Republican Congressman \"a fighter who has won contested primaries before and we are ready to win this fight.\" \"We already have more than 200 strong conservatives across the state on our Grassroots Leadership Team. We've had over 600 volunteers sign up since we announced. Our campaign will win and defeat Doug Jones in 2020,\" Seth Morrow, Bradley Byrne Campaign Manager, added in a statement to CBS.\u00a0 Alabama's Secretary of State John Merrill has filed papers with the Federal Election Commission but will not decide if he is running until the end of June.\u00a0 Asked what he'd like to do differently this time around, Moore told reporters on Thursday: \"I would like to make more personal contact with people.\" CBS News reporter covering the Pentagon.",

            "article_content": " In this episode of the \"Intelligence Matters\" podcast, host Michael Morell speaks with Sue Mi Terry, senior fellow for Korea at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. A former senior CIA analyst, Terry explains why the U.S.-North Korea talks are at a stalemate after months of negotiations and three historic summits between President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un. Terry tells Morell Kim has not taken a single step toward denuclearization, nor has he made the strategic decision to renounce his nuclear weapons program, all while continuing to test shorter-range missiles. Terry also outlines concerns about regional proliferation and the prospects of arriving at an interim nuclear deal before the 2020 election. INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - SUE MI TERRY CORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELL PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS \tMICHAEL MORELL: Sue, welcome back to Intelligence Matters. It's great to have you back on the show. This is your third time with us, tying a record. You're actually competing with your colleague from CSIS, that's Chris Johnson (LAUGH) for most on the podcast. But it's great to have you back. \tSUE MI TERRY: Great. Thanks for having me. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Sue, I wanted to have you on the show to give our listeners an update on North Korea. There is a lot that's going on in the world, from impeachment and elections here at home, to tension with Iran and Turkey abroad. And North Korea's fallen off the front pages. There's not that much discussion about it at the moment. So I thought it important that at least we here on Intelligence Matters and our listeners not lose sight of what is an extraordinarily important issue. So that's what I'd love to do. And maybe the place to start, Sue, is to remind us kind of how we got from where we were at the end of the Obama administration, to where we are today. How would you tell the arc of that story? \tSUE MI TERRY: When President Trump first came into the office, President Obama first told President Trump that North Korea is going to be the number one security issue. And it turned out to be true. In 2017, North Korea conducted many tests, including three ICBM tests, intercontinental ballistic missile tests, which the United States, from the US's perspective, used to always say that's the threshold because now they have a missile that can reach New York or Washington. They also conducted nuclear tests with a hydrogen bomb test. It was a very powerful test. And so if you remember in 2017, the Trump administration was pursuing what they called a maximum pressure policy. And, along with a fire and fury rhetoric and calling Kim a rocket man on a suicide mission-- \tMICHAEL MORELL: And the maximum-- \tSUE MI TERRY: --and all of that. \tMICHAEL MORELL: --pressure was largely sanctions? \tSUE MI TERRY: Largely sanctions. And to the Trump administration's credit, I do think they got countries like China to actually implement sanctions. And for a skeptic like myself and a lot of Korea watchers, that was a genuine surprise that, by fall of 2017 we had China implementing sanctions because in the previous administrations, China was a little \u00a0 bit lax, let's say, in terms of implementing sanctions. So we were in full on, maximum pressure stage with North Korea in response to their nuclear tests and missile tests. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Do you think China was helpful in that situation because they were worried -- \tSUE MI TERRY: Yes. \tMICHAEL MORELL: --about the tension on the peninsula? \tSUE MI TERRY: Absolutely. I do think China's favorite saying with the Korean peninsula is, \"No war, no instability, no nukes,\" and in that order. And I think, with maximum pressure, with this fire and fury rhetoric, China was concerned about potential instability in the Korean peninsula, potential conflict. If you remember, it was also a time when we were talking about a potential preventive strike on North Korea, a bloody nose  strategy, pursuing that strategy. South Koreans were so alarmed about all of this. So that was 2017. And then all of a sudden in 2018, we have Kim Jong Un's new year editorial that sort of indicated maybe North Korea was shifting to sort of the charm offensive phase. Because North Korea said, \"You know what? We're done with our testing. We're going to now try to focus on economic development.\" And then President Moon, Moon Jae-in of South Korea, played a pivotal role in terms of sort of saying, \"It's time for diplomacy.\" Invited the North Koreans to participate in the PyeongChang Olympics, Winter Olympics in South Korea. And President Trump responded to all this by saying, \"I'm going to meet with Kim Jong Un.\" \tMICHAEL MORELL: Why do you think Kim Jong Un made that shift in that new year speech? \tSUE MI TERRY: Kim is very interesting. He's a very shrewd guy. That move also caught many Korea watchers off-guard because he was about 90%, 95% done with North Korea's nuclear program. He has demonstrated an ICBM capability because they have tested three times intercontinental ballistic missiles. He just conducted a hydrogen nuclear test. And I think he felt comfortable in terms of where they were in their nuclear missile program. And that he didn't feel the need to go all the way to show 100% capability in terms of being able to strike New York City with a nuclear weapon or Washington DC, right? The North Koreans had a little more to go in terms of showing that capability. Militarization capability, I think most Korea watchers thought North Koreans were there. But they needed to showcase a successful reentry capability. They had a  couple more things, steps to do. But he stopped. He didn't need to go 100%. He said, \"This is good enough. I'm going to stop here.\" So I think the combination of getting North Korea's nuclear missile program to where he wanted it and then sort of saying, \"I'm not going to push it further because of all this bloody nose talk that's coming out of Washington.\" So I think it's a combination of reasons that have made him pivot to charm offensive. Sending the North Korean athletes to the South Korean Olympics, and then proposing meeting with Trump. And President Trump, of course, said, \"I want to meet with Kim.\" It's not true that President Obama or President Bush were so dying to meet with the North Korean leader. It was active policy where previous US presidents didn't want to give that kind of legitimacy to a North Korean leader by sitting down with him. I think President Trump said, \"Kim called President Obama how many times. And Obama begged. President Obama begged to meet with Kim Jong Un.\" That's not true. Neither President Obama nor President Bush wanted to meet with a North Korean leader because that would be giving legitimacy to the leader. But President Trump obviously, was not concerned about that. Wanted to sit down with Kim. So then we had the historic Singapore Summit, where President Trump met with Kim Jong Un. Then we also had the Hanoi Summit, which obviously didn't work out because North Koreans came in with such an ask. What they asked for basically is almost all lifting of UNSC, United Nations Security Council sanctions that are placed on North Korea. And then they met again briefly at the DMZ in the Korean peninsula President Trump and the leader of North Korean, Kim  Jong Un. And then just recently, the working level talks were held in Stockholm. That fell apart. So basically, since the Singapore Summit, despite the Singapore Declaration, despite North Korea saying they would work towards peace in the Korean peninsula and denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Despite President Trump saying right after the Singapore Summit that the North Korean threat is over, we are at a stalemate. North Korean threat is not over. They have not taken a single step towards denuclearization. And that's where we are. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Let me ask you a question about President Clinton because at the end of the second Clinton administration, President Clinton had signaled his willingness to go to North Korea. It didn't happen, at the end of the day. But he had signaled his willingness to go. How do you think about that, compared to \u00a0 what President Trump did? \tSUE MI TERRY: The order is very important there because President Clinton signaled his willingness to go to North Korea because we had a 1994 agreed framework. We had a bilateral agreement with North Korea. And that was towards the end of the administration that he was thinking about going. And, of course, he sent his secretary of state, former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, to Pyongyang. And it's just that they ran out of time. But there was a deal in place. And at the time, the US did not know that North Koreans were actually sort of cheating on that framework agreement. At the time, I don't think President Clinton knew that. So his willingness to visit came at the end of that whole, there was a negotiation, there was an agreement. It's many years later. Whereas with President Trump, nothing has worked out, right? There  were no working level talks that were held where there was an agreement. President Trump thought only if he could just sit down with Kim Jong Un, they could somehow hammer out a deal. So it's-- \tMICHAEL MORELL: Backwards? \tSUE MI TERRY: --a very backward approach. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So Sue, we're at a stalemate. What's the underlying problem? What's the underlying dynamic that doesn't allow any sort of serious negotiation to go forward? \tSUE MI TERRY: Most fundamentally, I don't think Kim has made the strategic decision to give up his nuclear weapons program. I think it's pretty clear now. I was hoping before the Singapore Summit that maybe, just maybe, Kim is truly different from his father and grandfather in that regard. But I don't think he has made t he strategic decision to give it up. Then there's the actual problem of sequencing. So even if you give him that remotest possibility, which I don't think he has made that decision, but even if you allow yourself to say, \"Okay, maybe Kim has made that decision. He just doesn't want to give up everything up front,\" we're not asking for that. But there's a sequencing problem because what the North Koreans are saying is that the United States has to lift most of the sanctions before they can take the first step towards denuclearization. And obviously, what the United States is saying, sanctions the only real leverage that we have. And if we would lift most of the sanctions, why would Kim have any incentive to give it up? So I think there's a sequencing problem. There's also distrust with each other. North \u00a0 Koreans also don't trust us because they have experience with the Clinton years. There was a great framework. Bill Clinton almost went to Pyongyang. Time ran out. President Bush came in, sort of reversed the policy. So they kind of point to that and then they point to the US being a democracy. And we have a change of administration. And we're not going to be actually keeping our word that they can really trust us. And of course, from the US's perspective, we cannot trust North Korea. We have a long history of dealing with North Korea. We had many agreements with North Korea, right? We had 1994 agreement framework. And during the Bush years, we had the whole Six Party Talks. And so we had a 2005 agreement, 2007 we had a joint statement. And every single time, everything fell apart \u00a0 over verification. So even after there's an agreement, there's a fundamental distrust, there's a sequencing issue. And at the core, I don't think North Korea is interested in giving up nuclear weapons. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So he hasn't made up his mind to do that. Do you think he's open to the idea? Do you think he debates it in his mind? Or is this no way, no how? Or is there more going on here, do you think? Is he actually thinking about it? I know that's a really tough question. \tSUE MI TERRY: I think that's a very tough question. And really serious Korea scholars can debate this, and we do debate. This is my personal assessment, I don't think Kim will do that. I don't think he has made up his mind to that. And I don't see why he would do that. North Korea is a nuclear weapons power. North Korea is not Libya, what Libya was.  It's not Afghanistan. North Korea has up to 60 nuclear warheads. They have intercontinental ballistic missiles. They believe nuclear weapons are the true deterrent, the only deterrent against the United States. And everybody knows North Koreans want regime survival and nuclear weapons are a deterrent against the United States and potential threat to North Korea. So why would you give it up? Some people point to the fact that Kim Jong Un is a young man, that he'll actually want to develop North Korea economically. I buy that. Of course, he does. But from a North Korean perspective, they can have nuclear weapons and they can develop their country. So if he's eating his cake or having it, what's the phrase? (LAUGH) Right, he can do both. Why does he have to give up nuclear weapons? So I really have a hard time believing that North Korea will ever give up nuclear weapons. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So we've had this stalemate. And they haven't tested any more nuclear weapons, or they haven't tested any more ICBMs. They've done some tests of shorter range missiles. But are they still advancing in their capabilities on the nuclear weapons side and the ICBM side during the stalemate or not? \tSUE MI TERRY: Yes. They have been working. Ever since the Singapore Summit, they have continually worked on their nuclear missile program. They've conducted dozens of short range missiles this year. And each time it, of course, improves their capability. They're assessing, they've done a summary base launch missile just recently, last month. So there's no indication that they have halted or they have stopped. In fact, they've been working on their program. So as we sit here, the North Korean threat has not gone away just because they don't test long  range missiles. They've been working on their program. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Would you say it's gotten worse? The threat has gotten worse as they make these advances? Is that too strong? \tSUE MI TERRY: I'm not sure if it's necessarily worse, but it certainly has [not] improved. I would say it's worse because they're improving their missile program. It at least feels like it's not worse because the missile test is not happening in front of our eyes, these scary intercontinental ballistic missile tests. But they've been working on it. So unless we can resolve the North Korean crisis, the threat has not gone away at all. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So I guess the one thing we have achieved here is a reduction in the tension that we saw very early in the Trump administration, right? With Kim doing the rapid tests and Tr ump doing the fire and fury. So that has gone away. How important is that? \tSUE MI TERRY: I do think it's important that we have some reduction of threat, a sense, right, because those were anxiety-filled days for Korea watchers like myself in 2017. And the whole talk of preventive war, bloody nose, is just not very helpful. Not only in dealing with North Korea, but with our allies like South Korea. South Korea was very unnerved by that kind of talk, preventive war talk. So I do think that's good that we're not talking about war in the Korean peninsula. So that is good. But as we just talked about, the fact of the matter is, North Korea's missile capability and nuclear capability is there. Their threat is there. They're improving on that capability. So it's not time for us to sit here and relax and think everything is fine just because North Korea's not testing  ICBMs. \tMICHAEL MORELL: What about the sanctions? What's the status of the sanctions? Have they started to erode from where they were at the peak? Are they pretty much the same? How do you think about that? \tSUE MI TERRY: Sanctions are definitely eroding. Not because we have lifted any of the sanctions, but because what's so important about sanctions is that we get countries like China and Russia to implement sanctions. That's why I said earlier that in 2017, in the fall, we got China to actually implement sanctions. Now, in the aftermath of President Trump meeting with Kim, Xi Jinping has also met with Kim four times now. Their actual relationship is back on track, China and North Korea. Until the president met with Kim, or made a decision to meet with Kim, Xi \u00a0 Jinping had never met with Kim Jong Un since Kim Jong Un came into power. Xi Jinping had met with the South Korean leader, former President Park Geun-hye and Moon Jae-in many times, but not with Kim Jong Un. Actually, Xi Jinping didn't even like Kim because Kim killed Jang Song Thaek, the second most powerful man in North Korea, his uncle who was an interlocutor with the Chinese. Assassinated Kim Jong-nam, his half brother who was under the protection of China. All these missile and nuclear tests. The Chinese were very unhappy with that. But now they're back in the picture. Xi met with Kim. Xi Jinping hosted Kim Jong Un and his wife and even visited Pyongyang. So now, China is loosening the implementation of sanctions. So it's not a good stage because now that's giving breathing space to North Korea. And  so if we want to use sanctions as leverage, it's not good news for the United States and the international community when sanctions are not implemented on the ground and you're giving breathing space to the North Koreans. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So Sue, what do you expect to happen between the United States and North Korea between now and our election? \tSUE MI TERRY: So I think there are two scenarios. And both scenarios are bad for the United States. One scenario is that there will be an interim deal. That President Trump decides that he needs a foreign policy success story. He did after [all] say the North Korean threat was no longer there after the Singapore Summit. So there is a deal. But what North Koreans are asking for is massive sanctions relief. So I don't believe we're going to have a deal unless we're ready to give some big sanctions relief. And \u00a0 in return, we'll get maybe just a freeze of nuclear testing. And they'll pull up the Yongbyon nuclear plant, which they've closed before. So there might be an interim deal of some sort, which I don't believe is necessarily moving towards denuclearization. It's sort of a freeze. \tMICHAEL MORELL: In order to get that deal, we'd have to give them pretty much everything they wanted? \tSUE MI TERRY: Right, which is massive sanctions relief, which is what they asked for even in Hanoi. And that's why it fell apart. Or, we don't do that. There's no interim deal. Kim Jong Un says, \"The timeline is until the end of the year.\" The end of the year clock runs out. There is no deal. Come January, there's no [deal]. And I'm not sure if North Koreans would necessarily sort of revert back to the ICBM tests and nuke tests because they know  that's sort of the red line for President Trump. But there're many things that they can do that are just short of that threshold, such as medium range missile tests over Japan. Or even a satellite launch. A satellite launch is very interesting because it uses ballistic missile technology, so it's really an ICBM test, but still, North Koreans can at least insist that this is different, that it's a satellite launch. Maybe even President Trump might say, \"Listen, this is a satellite launch. And other countries can do this.\" So I think either we have a deal or we return to provocations. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And what's the point of the provocations if you're North Korea? What are you trying to achieve with the provocations? \tSUE MI TERRY: You are continually dialing up pressure,  right? So if you do a medium range test over Japan, if you do a satellite launch, they're headed towards that nuke test. And let's say, now this is an election year, let's say we're now talking March, April of next year. They're trying to dial up the pressure for either the US to come in and say, \"Okay, fine, we'll give you almost everything you want.\" \tMICHAEL MORELL: And get to that interim deal you talked about? \tSUE MI TERRY: Or they just run out the clock, wait for the election, see if President Trump gets reelected. And then maybe they will deal with it then, or a new president in the US. And then, of course, the long term goal for North Korea, and I still think this is a long term goal and this is what they're seeking, is to gain international acceptance of North Korea as a nuclear weapons power.  They want to be Pakistan, right? For the international community to accept North Korea as a responsible nuclear weapons power. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Why is that a bad thing at the end of the day? Why should we worry about that? Why should it be our policy not to let that happen? \tSUE MI TERRY: First of all, just the message it's sending to all other countries, world countries around there, like Iran and others that are watching, that all you have to do is just keep at it and we'll just accept it. Secondly, I think one of the biggest concerns is regional proliferation because once we accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons power, what is South Korea going to do? South Korea is already now talking about it. There are conservative circles out of South  Korea right now talking about potentially developing their own nuclear weapons, or at least bringing tactical nuclear weapons back. And then Japan, with Prime Minister Abe has been trying to work on trying to normalize Japan in terms of their self-defense forces to having a normal military. What will Japan do? Would Japan possibly go nuclear? So we're worried about regional proliferation. And, of course, we're also worried about global proliferation, in additional to this wrong message we're sending to the rest of the world and the rogue nations. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Sue, can you envision a deal that would be acceptable to both sides? \tSUE MI TERRY: I can envision a deal if we have a different mindset. So if we say to ourselves, \"Let's talk to arms control because we're never going to get to denuclearization. So let's  get realistic.\" And there are many arms control scholars and experts who say, \"This is about threat reduction.\" So if we can get to a deal where they freeze all their fissile material production, they freeze all programs. And that it can be verified that they're doing so, they're abiding by that. Then I can some sort of a deal that's possible. If you get into the mindset that that's okay. But that's the debate, is that okay or is that not okay because that's really accept North Korea-- \tMICHAEL MORELL: That's accepting it, right. \tSUE MI TERRY: --as a nuclear weapons power. And I failed to mention beyond regional proliferation, another concern about really accepting North Korea as a nuclear weapons power is that there is a concern that their behavior, North Korean behavior, is not necessarily going to get better once they're fully  accepted as a nuclear weapons power. But that their behavior can get even more aggressive because now they think they have the deterrent against the United States. And so meaning sort of border clashes that used to occur with South Korea could still occur, or the asymmetrical warfare like cyber, that can all continue. So it's not like North Korea's threat is going to go away or provocations are going to go away just because we accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons power. In fact, they could get more confident and continue on with provocations. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Do you think North Korea still envisions reunification of peninsula on their terms? \tSUE MI TERRY: It's a very difficult question because on one hand, I do think the North Koreans cannot give up ultimately on the idea of reunification on its own terms because to  live with a richer, freer, democratic rival state, which is what North Korea's doing right now. South Korea is a rival state. They're just right there for everyone to see. It's a free, richer rival state. And ultimately, North Korea's, of course, worried about German style unification, right? Unification but absorption. This is their ultimate fear. So I don't think they can give it up. Now, the question though is, is Kim Jong Un aware of how realistic that scenario is? South Korea is a thriving democracy. You saw what they did as a public. Candlelight vigils ousted their last president. It's a thriving democracy. Can this kind of democratic nation be okay to be just completely unified by North Korea on its own terms? But as a goal, can North Korea afford to give up that goal? I don't think so. So my answer would be I don't think North Korea gave it up as a goal. Just as a practical  matter, I'm not sure if it's so realistic. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So let me ask several broader questions about North Korea. And these will be kind of random. How do you think about Kim Jong Un's domestic, political position? \tSUE MI TERRY: I think he has consolidated power and his domestic position is strong. Although, I would think that the long term picture domestically, I don't think is so stable. It's just an inherently unstable system. The reason is, for example, information, that North Korea controls its own public with a complete information blockade and ideological indoctrination, but information is seeping into North Korea more and more through the China-North Korea border. And Kim cannot completely stop that. Private markets are thriving, black markets. Kim cannot stop that. This is the only way people are able-- \tMICHAEL MORELL: Surviving? \tSUE MI TERRY: --to live, survive. So he cannot stop that. And even the elites though, even though they support him, because Kim purged almost anybody who can be a rival to him, I would think that long term, elites would be worried about their future because of so many purges and the very ruthless way in which Kim has consolidated power. So I would say, yes, he has consolidated power right now. No, we don't see any kind of potential challengers to Kim because Kim got rid of them. But overall, the long term stability picture is still not a great one. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So I remember, as you know, I worked on North Korea a long, long, long, long time ago. I don't want to say how long ago. (LAUGH) But even at that time, we were saying, \"This system can't survive forever.\" \u00a0 But boy, it's hung on, right? \tSUE MI TERRY: Yes. I often describe it as like a coma patient, right? You heard that phrase before. It's like a coma patient. It's sort of you can go any day, or you can just go on another 50 years. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. Right. Let me ask about the human rights situation in North Korea, which we don't hear much about, doesn't get discussed. Certainly, the United States has not made it the kind of issue that we used to make it. Has it gotten any better? Has it gotten worse? Is it roughly the same as it's been? How do you think about that? \tSUE MI TERRY: I don't think it has gotten any better. This is sort of the thing that I regret about this as policy. I do think when President Trump first came into office in 2017 he did at least appear that he cared about North K orea's human rights issue. The State of the Union Address. He brought Otto Warmbier's family to the State of the Union Address. He invited a North Korean defector. He hosted several meetings with North Korean defectors. When he went to South Korea, he gave this big speech in front of the National Assembly. He addressed North Korean human rights. But all of that sort of got thrown out just because he wanted to now not annoy Kim. No, the human rights situation has not gotten better. The United Nations Commission inquiry came out with a 400 page report several years ago that really details all the human rights violations that are going on in North Korea, which is an excellent report. It says, \"There's no parallel in contemporary history to the human rights violations that are going on in North Korea, \u00a0 except to Nazi Germany.\" So that's how bad it is. They call what's happening in North Korea a crime against humanity. And they list Kim Jong Un by name as somebody who perpetuates crime against humanity. And we see no indication that North Korea has changed or closed any of the political prison camps that keep some 120,000 political prisoners. That's a completely separate system. There's a regular criminal penal system, and then there are political prisons where they keep these dissidents or anybody who dares to criticize Kim. So I do think it's a very sad situation. And, of course, we just don't focus enough on it. We don't prioritize enough on human rights in North Korea. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So Sue, let me finish up here by asking you two final questions. The first is about the health of the US relationship with South Korea. Seems to be fraying a bit. Is that  your sense? \tSUE MI TERRY: Yes. It's definitely fraying because the US and South Korea right now are engaged in a border sharing negotiation. And, of course, President Trump came up with this figure of $5 billion that he's asking for South Koreans to pay, which is five times the money that they are paying. President Trump just has said over and over many times for many years, this is something he actually believes in, which is that the US is getting taken advantage of by our allies. A country like South Korea is rich. They need to be paying more. So it's a particularly bad time. And, of course, with the Korea-Japan relationship fraying, the US does not like that, what's happening with South Korea and Japan. And so I think this is a particularly difficult period. I would say the South Korean public does support alliance. When  you see the polls, they really do broadly support the alliance. They support the US presence in South Korea. But I think right now at this particular moment, they feel like they're being extorted with this ask of $5 billion for South Korea [defense]. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And are there costs to us in the fraying of the relationship? \tSUE MI TERRY: Of course because I do think South Korea's one of the closest allies in the region. Our troops are in South Korea also not only to deter North Korea, right? This is also to protect Japan, it's our forward presence. It has also to do with dealing with China. And South Korea and the US have stood side by side for over 70 plus years keeping peace not only on the Korean peninsula, but in the entire Northeast Asian region. South Korea's a very important ally. And we are there in South Korea not only for South Korea, but we \u00a0 have interests in the region. So I do think just really rhetorically and just by demanding that they pay so much more, this is really hurting even the public perception of the alliance right now. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Does the health of the relationship have any political impact in South Korea on South Korean politics? \tSUE MI TERRY: So South Korean politics are interesting right now. There's a National Assembly election that's coming up in April. Yes. Normally, if the public saw it as the Moon Jae-in administration's fault that the alliance is fraying, it would actually cost the Moon Jae-in administration politically. But because right now they see us, the United States, asking for $5 billion as so unreasonable, that's not what's going to be hurting the Moon administration from the public's perspective-- \tMICHAEL MORELL: Got you. Got you. So Sue, the second question I had was, and you mentioned it already, the state of the relationship between Japan and South Korea. What's the story there? \tSUE MI TERRY: It's the worst that it has ever been in terms of the Korea-Japan relationship. I think most people are surprised when they hear it. They're not aware Korea-Japan, historically the relationship between the two countries. They're two allies of the United States. They're mature, liberal democracies. Yet historically, their relationship has always had ups and downs ever since Japan colonized Korea from 1910 to 1945. And even though there was a normalization agreement in 1965, it's just unsettled over historical grievances, over issues like comfort women, over the South Koreans feeling like the  Japanese have not apologized enough, and so on. But the recent spate of tension, recent tension, basically what happened was when the administration came in, he decided to go scrap the deal that took place between former South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japan on the comfort women deal. And the Moon administration sort of said, \"No, we're not going to abide by that agreement.\" \tMICHAEL MORELL: And just a reminder, the comfort women issue is? \tSUE MI TERRY: The sex slaves issue. That the Japanese basically forced women from many countries, but including South Korea, to basically work as sex slaves during the war. \tMICHAEL MORELL: For Japanese soldiers? \tSUE MI TERRY: For the Japanese soldiers. There's a  disagreement on that issue, how that's perceived. After going back on the comfort women deal, there was a South Korean Supreme Court decision that said they're forcing Japanese companies to basically pay for wartime labor of South Koreans. That South Koreans can individually sue the Japanese. That was the last straw for the Japanese. So they retaliated economically by taking South Korea off the white list. And then South Korea retaliated by taking Japan off the white list. And right now, there is what you call an intel-sharing deal between Japan and South Korea, called GSOMIA. Really, that helps the US, South Korea and Japan work together in terms of intelligence sharing. It's very important because it helps us deal with China, it helps us deal with North Korea. And that is about to expire on November 22nd. And so that has caused all kinds of tension too. It's been coming for the last several years. But I  would say today, the Korea-Japan relationship is at its worst. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And should we, the United States, be doing something to help bring these two allies back together that we're not doing? Or are we doing what we should be doing here? \tSUE MI TERRY: I think we can do more. In the previous administration, the Korea-Japan always had ups and downs. But the more the US gets engaged, there are periods when it's better, right? So under the Obama administration, Tony Blinken and others sort of forced the Koreans and the Japanese to sit down regularly and talk to each other. So I do think the US must be engaged. These are two of the closest allies, friends of the United States. It's critical that the trilateral relationship is a good one. And it just hurts our interest to see these two allies at each other's throats like this.  It's very sad to see. And I hope we can find a way out of this. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Sue, thank you so much for joining us. It is always good to have you on the show. \tSUE MI TERRY: Thank you for having me. \t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump's presidential campaign is pumping money into impeachment-related Facebook ads.\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ben Mitchell\u00a0reports that between Tuesday (the day House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry) and Wednesday, the Trump campaign spent close to $500,000 on ads that tell users they're part of the \"Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.\"\u00a0 The ads also tell users the House Democrats \"want to take YOUR VOTE away,\" and encourage them to \"contribute to the Impeachment Defense Fund.\" According to the left-leaning digital consulting firm Acronym, the Trump campaign likely spent more on digital ads in 24 hours than any campaign has spent in the same time period this cycle. The effort appeared to bear fruit: on Wednesday, Mr. Trump's campaign manager\u00a0Brad Parscale announced\u00a0the campaign had raised $5 million in small dollar donations in just 24 hours. In other news, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee are spending $10 million to run an ad to attack Joe Biden over the Ukraine issue. Mr. Trump tweeted out the ad Friday afternoon.\u00a0 STEVE BULLOCK On Friday, Montana Governor Steve Bullock unveiled his \"Comprehensive Public Lands Plan\" in celebration of National Public Lands Day Saturday. The plan aims to defend public lands from \"exploitation\" while fighting climate change and expanding access.\u00a0 It is the first plan of Bullock's \"Great Equalizers\" policy initiatives. \u00a0 According to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry, highlights of this plan include conservation efforts to keep public lands public, working through the $21 billion maintenance backlog on Department of Interior and U.S. Forest Service lands and fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The plan also calls for achieving net-zero emissions on public lands by 2030 and supporting clean energy projects on public lands. \u00a0 Finally, Bullock calls for Native American Tribes to partner with the federal government in federal land management and providing equitable access to public lands. In a statement provided by the campaign Bullock said, \"Americans have always said our shared stewardship of our public lands is really one of our country's great equalizers \u2014 we all own them.\" BERNIE SANDERS What you hear around Washington regarding Bernie Sanders' campaign is very different from what you'll find on the road, reports\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Cara Korte. Newspaper headlines say that he's slipping in the polls to Elizabeth Warren. This is true. However it's also true that he's consistently holding\u00a0some of the most emotional events of any candidate, particularly when the topic of health care comes up.\u00a0 Sanders and his supporters still engage in emotional and impassioned dialogues that demonstrate the fierce devotion some have to the Vermont senator. Supporters weep to Sanders as they reveal personal struggles, and in turn Sanders provides comfort. One attendee recently told Sanders that debt collectors entered her son's room while he was being cared for in the ICU. \"They had to call security on me because I lost my mind,\" she said. \"There's no way out for us other than you, Bernie.\" On the road it's clear that Sanders' appeal burns bright in the eyes of his supporters. His challenge this election is to get that fire to not just burn bright, but burn wide across the country. TOM STEYER Tom Steyer marched with striking UAW members in Reno today, outside a GM facility in northern Nevada, says CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin.\u00a0 The California billionaire has already spent millions in his long-shot presidential bid, including the first and largest to date television ad buys in Nevada. While far behind the race's frontrunners, Steyer has polled better than candidates (i.e. Juli\u00e1n Castro) who have held dozens more campaign stops in the state. \"I think this is all about message,\" Steyer said, citing his condemnation of \"corporate greed.\" He dismissed accusations tying the campaign's ad budget to his relative success in the state, telling CBS News: \"That's a way of getting out the message but the whole question is do people hear something that's true and different? And if it isn't, nothing else matters, and if it is, nothing else matters.\" ELIZABETH WARREN Elizabeth Warren on Friday morning released a\u00a0plan\u00a0to strengthen congressional independence from corporate lobbyists by reinstating and modernizing the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA).\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says the OTA was defunded in 1995, but previously provided research and analysis to members of Congress.\u00a0 The idea fits well into Warren's stump speech, in which she uses Congress' initial bipartisan interest in fighting climate change early on to illustrate that \"bought and paid-for experts\" have given politicians an \"umbrella\" of doubt to hide under when corporate interests don't want them to move forward on things like new emission standards. Warren wants this new OTA to be led be a single director, be able to self-commission reports, be prepared for rapid response and have its own in-house experts.\u00a0 This plan also calls for increased funding to go to congressional support agencies like the Congressional Research Service, Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget Office, which have seen their budgets nearly halved over the past 40 years. Warren's plan would also increase the pay of congressional staffers to \"competitive salaries.\" This is the fifth plan Warren has released that specifically targets what she calls \"Washington corruption.\" ANDREW YANG Asked by a voter how an economic recession would impact his campaign, Andrew Yang gave a blunt response today in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga. The entrepreneur told Granite Staters, \"I think that if we do have a downturn over this next period, it would likely be good for my campaign because I'm so focused on this set of issues. And I think it would actually increase the appeal and appetite for some of the measures I'm describing.\"\u00a0 Yang continued, warning of possible resentment among disenfranchised Americans in the wake of the 2008 economic recession and 2016 presidential election. \"We saw what happened in the financial crisis, where we prioritized the banks. We saw what happened with this latest Trump tax cut, where we prioritized the big corporations, where they got the vast majority of the $1.5 trillion cut.\"\u00a0 On a much lighter note \u2013 following some social media hype, Yang says his team is working on finalizing a date for a basketball match up between him and Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz. \"We're probably going to do it in DC or Texas. Give him home court advantage. He deserves it,\" Yang quipped. \"After all, he's a sitting senator who has decided to play me in basketball.\" TEXAS The ninth annual TribFest took off Thursday night with a conversation between Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith and Congressman Will Hurd, who announced in August he will not be running for re-election. Hurd is one of five Texas GOP representatives who is not running for re-election in 2020, though he said at the festival if he did run it would be a \"four-peat.\"\u00a0 Hurd, Kenny Marchant and Pete Olson are all retiring Texas House members who won by less than 5 percent in 2018, which is giving hope to some Democrats who are looking to flip the state blue in 2020. As\u00a0CBS News Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro & CBS News Associate Producer Ellee Watson\u00a0have reported, Texas Democrats are pushing to register at least 2.6 million voters and put 1,000 field organizers on the ground.\u00a0 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is also targeting six districts in the state after flipping two seats blue in 2018 and the Democratic National Committee has increased investments in the state party by 33 percent, compared to this time in 2015. The Republican Party of Texas has also launched their own voter registration and engagement effort, and a super PAC dedicated to registering Republican voters, \"Engage Texas,\" has raised close to $10 million dollars. Hurd, who won re-election by just over 925 votes in 2018, said at TribFest, \"Texas is a jump-ball. Texas is purple.\" Five presidential candidates in total are expected to make an appearance at the festival \u2014 Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Julian Castro, Beto O'Rourke and Steve Bullock. House lawmakers are heading out back to their districts this weekend and many will have to answer questions about their stance on impeachment.\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro &\u00a0CBS News Intern Malika Budd\u00a0counted at least 30 town halls have been announced for House Democrats from swing districts.\u00a0 When Congresswoman Mikie Sherill of New Jersey was asked by\u00a0Navarro\u00a0on Wednesday what she'd tell her constituents, she emphasized that she didn't run on impeachment and will look to focus on local issues instead. \"I'm afraid this might derail us from the things we've got to do. And we don't really have a choice in North Jersey, we've got to get infrastructure done. We've got to get taxes down, we've got to get health care costs down. So people in my district, that's what they want to focus on, that's what I want to focus on,\" she said. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said on Wednesday that she will do \"everything [she] can to explain to people\" how she came to support the impeachment inquiry. \"Because my hope is, even if they disagree with the decision, they give me the benefit of the doubt that I was judicious about it and that I did it based on my background and a sense of integrity to the oath that I took,\" she said.\u00a0 CBS News Political Correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0reports\u00a0that these lawmakers were sent back with guidance on talking impeachment in a memo from House Democratic Leadership. In the memo, Democrats are suggested to hone in on the national security implications of the whistleblower complaint and President Trump's contacts with Ukraine. \"President Trump's abuse of power jeopardizes our national security and the integrity of our elections, and dishonors his oath of office 'to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,'\" the memo says.

            "article_content": "Don't expect Joe Biden to lead the charge on presidential impeachment as he seems to be playing a long game,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0writes.\u00a0Remember, the former vice president has already been through two\u00a0impeachment\u00a0processes during his time in the Senate so he knows what he is looking for. Since May, Biden has consistently said the decision on whether to impeach President Trump is up to House Democrats. A senior campaign official told Erickson\u00a0that the campaign would not recalculate it message on impeachment, although Biden has been sharply critical of Mr. Trump's decision to reach out to the Ukrainian government about his son Hunter Biden. The younger Biden had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company when his father was vice president. In a July phone call, Mr. Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to \"look into\" whether Joe Biden encouraged Kiev to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son. The House impeachment inquiry is expected to focus on whether Mr. Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens. But even as they outwardly project an untroubled attitude in tangentially dealing with this impeachment inquiry, the Biden campaign is not letting this opportunity float by. The campaign has fundraised off this episode at least four times since Saturday. One senior campaign official said this is because \"we're under attack\" and donating is one ways supporters fight back. Some in Biden's orbit, like two of his long-time fundraisers, argue that the Ukraine issue will benefit his campaign because it indicates Mr. Trump sees the former vice president as his most formidable opponent. Something else to consider: Will the House impeachment proceedings wrap before the 2020 election?\u00a0Erickson\u00a0tweets the historical context: HOW LONG IS IMPEACHMENT PROCESS?Johnson:2/24/1868 (impeachment res)\u27a1\ufe0f5/26/1868 (2nd round of Senate trial acquits)= 92 daysNixon:2/6/1974 (impeachment res)\u27a1\ufe0f8/9/1974 (Nixon resigns) = 185 daysClinton:10/8/1998 (impeachment res)\u27a1\ufe0f2/12/1999 (Senate acquits Clinton)=127 days JOE BIDEN Separately,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says Biden's campaign sponsored Wednesday's\u00a0influential \"Shepherd's Breakfast\"\u00a0in Las Vegas, with supporter Chris Scott praising Biden's record as vice president to the monthly gathering of black pastors and community leaders. While campaigns have flocked to support the monthly summit in the 11 years since Pastor Bill McDonnell founded it, Biden's campaign is the first of the 2020 candidates to help foot the bill.\u00a0 Courting Nevada's black church community could be key to protecting Biden's lead among African Americans in Nevada.\u00a0A poll this week\u00a0from the Reno Gazette Journal and Suffolk University found the former vice president netting 34 percent among black likely caucus-goers in the state, with only Bernie Sanders (16 percent) also clearing double digits.\u00a0\u00a0 CORY BOOKER New Hampshire lawmakers and Democratic activists are rallying around Senator Cory Booker following the release of a campaign memo indicating the presidential contender needs to raise at least $1.7 million dollars by the end of the third fundraising quarter ending September 30, in order to compete in the latter stages of the Democratic presidential campaign. \"I'm undecided, but @CoryBooker is on my shortlist. He needs to stay in the race!\" New Hampshire State Senator Cindy Rosenwald\u00a0announced on twitter Saturday. One of Booker's top supporters, veteran Democratic campaign operative Jim Demers, tells\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0a winnowed field and two-night debate may aid the New Jersey lawmaker, should the campaign make their end-of-the-month fundraising deadline. \"It's going to give the candidates a chance to answer substantively on the issues,\" Demers said.\u00a0 The former Obama senior advisor recalls then Illinois then-Senator Barack Obama's \"take-off moment\" in November of 2007 at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Des Moines, Iowa. \"We're heading into that same kind of time period where the voters have paid attention, but they haven't really locked up a decision.\" He added, \"I'm really hopeful that we see a similar situation where Cory Booker has his moment and then takes off.\" \"It's like the Kentucky Derby,\" New Hampshire State Senator David Watters, an early Booker backer, tells\u00a0Sganga. \"Every horse finishes the race, but you want to be at the front of the pack. You don't want to finish 20 legs back.\" His presidential pick, Watters attests, has the kind of energetic New Hampshire ground game and message required to finish in the pack. \u00a0 Booker has received the backing of three New Hampshire state senators and thirteen state representatives in a presidential cycle that has seen few early political endorsements relative to years past. The household name to many in New Hampshire's political class fostered goodwill by fundraising upwards of $170,000 during the 2018 elections for New Hampshire's Democratic ticket, according to a senior adviser.\u00a0 The former Newark Mayor was the only presidential contender to campaign for down ballot candidates, ignoring instructions from party leaders to skip New Hampshire's midterms. The senator returns to the Granite State on Thursday to participate in a \"first-in the-nation\" staple, Politics and Eggs. The event, organized by the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, will put the New Jersey Senator before an audience of local political kingmakers, business leaders and students four days before the third-quarter fundraising deadline. MARK SANFORD Republican presidential candidate and former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford wrapped up a four day swing in Iowa on Wednesday with retail stops at a farm equipment dealership in Ankeny and an Arby's in Des Moines, where he chatted with people enjoying some lunch. At his stop in Ankeny,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says Sanford commented on the release of the call summary from the President's conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling it \"troubling.\"\u00a0 \"When you have the President of the United States in essence offering the aid of the Attorney General to a foreign government in their help of investigation of a political opponent, that in our form of government is crossing a red line,\" Sanford said. \"I would just encourage my Republican colleagues or former Republican colleagues to look at this and say 'how would I react if a Democratic president was doing the same?'\"\u00a0 Sanford wouldn't say whether the transcript itself showed an impeachable offense, adding that it had to play out in institutions like the House before that could be decided. Sanford's trip to Iowa featured mostly retail stops, where he spent time without cameras at restaurants, grocery stores and other places talking to voters about issues they face and how they feel about Mr. Trump. Three people who spoke to Sanford at the Arby's told reporters later that they are Republicans, and at this point plan to support Mr. Trump. In March, a\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN poll\u00a0found the president had an 81% approval rating with Republicans in the state.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 IN THE MIDDLE A new\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN poll\u00a0shows likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers are split on whether it's more important for Iowa to retain its first in the nation caucus status or switch to a primary to increase participation.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says 42% of respondents said it's more important for Iowa to remain first, even if it means \"not everyone who wants to can participate,\" while 44% say it's more important to hold a primary so \"everyone can vote,\" even if it comes at the expense of Iowa's first in the nation status.\u00a0 Another 14% said they're not sure. The poll has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4 percentage points.\u00a0 New Hampshire state law requires New Hampshire to be the first primary state, meaning a switch by Iowa could jeopardize its status as the first state to express presidential preference. The Democratic National Committee required caucus states, including Iowa, to find ways to increase voter participation in the 2020 cycle. The Iowa Democratic Party initially proposed a \"telecaucus\" system to do that, but the idea was rejected by the DNC's Rules & Bylaws Committee over security concerns.\u00a0 Last Friday, Iowa proposed a \"satellite caucus\" system, essentially allowing caucuses to be held outside of the preset precincts, which was conditionally approved by the DNC. Iowa's Democratic and Republican parties have consistently presented a united front that Iowa should retain its first-in-the-nation caucus status and have vowed to push back on anything that may alter that. TO YOUR HEALTH As health care remains a top priority among voters and 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, the\u00a02019 Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health Benefits Survey\u00a0released Wednesday found family premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance rose 5% to an average of more than $20,000 this year.\u00a0 On average, workers contribute $6,015 toward the cost of family coverage while employers pay the rest.\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0notes that, according to the survey, what employers and workers pay toward health care premiums continues to rise more quickly than workers' wages and inflation.\u00a0 Since 2009, average family premiums have increased 54% and workers contributions has increased 71%. The survey also found that while the 2020 Democratic primary has been highlighting the role of employer-sponsored health benefits, workers at firms with many low-income employees face some of the biggest challenges when it comes to affording care for their families. This is in part due to employers offering benefits to smaller shares of their workforces and requiring workers to pay higher premiums. IN THE SENATE On Wednesday, the Senate voted again to terminate Mr. Trump's national emergency at the border,\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ellee Watson. Congress voted in March to terminate the declaration but did not have enough votes to override the president's veto.\u00a0 The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee released a digital ad campaign targeting incumbent Republican senators who did not vote to terminate the emergency declaration that will divert millions from defense projects in their states, according to estimates by the Department of Defense. The ads against six incumbent GOP Senators will run primarily on Facebook.",

            "article_content": "Venezuela is engulfed in chaos\u00a0as two men claim to be the rightful leader of the country. Juan Guaid\u00f3, the former National Assembly leader who was appointed acting president in January, is pushing to oust Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who took over after the death of Hugo Chavez in 2013 and has consolidated an authoritarian grip over the country. The U.S. is backing Guiad\u00f3 and has declared Maduro \"illegitimate.\" While these two men are at the heart of the democratic crisis in Venezuela, the roots of the accompanying economic crisis began years earlier and accelerated with the death of Chavez and the collapse of a socialist, state-managed, oil-dependent Venezuelan economy. Chavez, a charismatic socialist and former military general, dominated Venezuela for 14 years as president. He won democratic elections in 1998, 2000, 2006 and 2012. By the time of his death in 2013, corruption and mismanagement by an entrenched state apparatus had ravaged a once-booming energy industry. Despite holding the world's largest oil reserves, Venezuela's debt exploded and inflation intensified the stress on an already poor economy. Into the vacuum left by Chavez stepped Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, his right-hand man. Maduro clung to power amid a total economic meltdown. He imposed laws that critics say wiped out all pretense of Venezuela being a democratic country. Opposition members were elected by huge majorities in 2015 to lead the National Assembly, a single-body legislature that is essentially Venezuela's version of Congress. They attempted to constrain Maduro with their newfound power. In response, Maduro called a\u00a0special election in 2017 that was widely denounced as rigged. It created the Constituent Assembly, a competing 545-seat body filled entirely with pro-Maduro loyalists, formed with the express purpose of drafting a new constitution for Venezuela. The Constituent Assembly has since granted itself virtually unlimited powers, and has banned the National Assembly from passing laws, refusing to recognize them. The Supreme Tribunal of Justice, Venezuela's version of the Supreme Court, is filled with Maduro-Chavez loyalists. In 2017, the Tribunal ruled to dissolve the National Assembly and granted themselves the power to write their own laws, cementing one-party rule in Venezuela. Protest movements erupted in 2017, fueled by by hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans opposed to the destruction of electoral democracy and alarmed by a deteriorating economic situation which has left millions trapped in poverty and starvation, lacking basic medical care and even electricity. Inflation recently hit\u00a0one million percent and more than a million people have fled the country. Maduro sent security and military forces to crack down on protests, operations that sometimes turned deadly. The United Nations has accused his regime of committing human rights violations. Political protesters have been detained without trial and opposition party lawmakers have been jailed. Venezuela's army has largely remained loyal to Maduro, and there are vigilante units called \"colectivos,\" numbering some\u00a01.6 million members, which run intimidation campaigns against the population and democratic protesters. Out of this chaos a new leader emerged. Juan Guaid\u00f3 became the face of Venezuela's opposition party when he contested the results of Maduro's 2018 electoral landslide, one deemed \"a sham\" by the U.S.\u00a0 Following what Guaid\u00f3 and the opposition deemed an illegitimate election, the National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare the office of the presidency as vacant. As speaker of the National Assembly, Guiad\u00f3 was appointed acting president in January in front of thousands of supporters. Young, vibrant, and telegenic, the 35-year-old Guaid\u00f3 has argued he is the rightful acting president of Venezuela, declaring Maduro an \"usurper.\" Maduro's only previous presidential election came in 2013, which he won by a slim margin over Henrique Capriles, who described the outcome as \"an illegitimate process.\" Guaid\u00f3's claim on the presidency has drawn support from the United States, while Russia is backing Maduro. The Trump administration refuses to recognize Maduro's government, calling him \"a dictator\" and hitting the regime with financial sanctions that have further weakened Venezuela's already crippled economy. Guaid\u00f3 was briefly detained by Maduro's forces in January, and his chief of staff was dragged from his home and\u00a0jailed in March. In February, Guaid\u00f3 traveled to neighboring Colombia to appeal for backing at a summit of regional leaders. He met there with Vice President Mike Pence, who expressed \"resolute\" U.S. support for his leadership. Meanwhile at the border, Maduro's troops unleashed tear gas on Venezuelan residents and blocked truckloads of humanitarian aid. On Tuesday morning, Guaid\u00f3 announced parts of the military supported his claim to leadership, and called on Venezuelans to rise up against the Maduro regime in an effort he called \"Operacion Libertad\" \u2014 Operation Freedom. A violent crackdown ensued. Maduro claimed victory\u00a0by Tuesday night, while Guaid\u00f3 called for more protests, leaving the presidential and economic crisis in Venezuela to continue.",

            "article_content": "Watch the new CBSN Originals documentary, \"Fake News, Real Consequences: The Woman Fighting Disinformation,\" in the video player above.\u00a0 In the early days of Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, social media seemed to hold boundless promise. Tech CEOs assured us their platforms offered a better way to connect the world, to share photos, to keep up with friends and family. As the 2016 U.S. election illustrated, however, social media can also be harnessed for less innocent purposes by those who recognize its power in controlling the narrative, to spread lies masquerading as the truth. The Philippines is considered by many to be a canary in the coal mine for the impact of disinformation online. While President Rodrigo Duterte's violent war on drugs drew international attention and condemnation, less well known is the way Duterte and his supporters have leveraged social media as a tool to both silence their critics and blur the line between fact and fiction. And some say, if nothing changes, a similar fate may await the U.S. \"This technology can enable groups of people to come together and to actually create things bottom up. That was the dream,\" said Maria Ressa, an award-winning journalist and the founder and CEO of Rappler, a media company launched in Manila in 2012 that uses social media as a central platform for distributing its work. \"And we succeeded for the first, I would say, five years or so. The sixth year was when social media was weaponized.\" After Duterte was elected, uniformed police and so-called death squads began targeting suspected drug dealers and users, and the death toll rapidly grew \u2014 by some estimates, into the tens of thousands. As reporters, like those at Rappler, cited these numbers and exposed the human toll of the drug war, Duterte and his supporters began wielding the power of social media to combat the criticism. Both Rappler and Maria herself came under attack online \u2014 often by social media accounts linked to Duterte supporters. Rumors and false information about Maria in particular began to spread, and often the accusations were repeated by either Duterte himself or a government-friendly newspaper such as the Manila Times. \"Constant attack, and then the Manila Times brings it to traditional media, and then the president says it. That's the way they work,\" Ressa said. It became a familiar and disturbing pattern \u2014 one that's also seen in other countries with authoritarian leaders, like Putin's Russia, Maduro's Venezuela, and Erdo\u011fan's Turkey. \"I call it the dictator's playbook. It's marched around the world,\" Ressa said. Rappler found the best way to combat these attacks was to track how the disinformation campaigns worked, to try and show the public precisely how they were being misinformed. Ironically, Rappler's work attracted the attention of Facebook itself and, in April, Rappler agreed to become one of Facebook's media partners in rooting out disinformation on the platform. Despite Rappler's efforts, Duterte appears to be prevailing. In May, the Philippine midterm elections were a sweep for Duterte supporters, with all 12 of the open Senate seats won by his picks. Duterte holds a 66% approval rating, and most national news outlets have largely stopped reporting on the drug war. As Rappler sounds the alarm, the government is doing all it can to silence it. Maria Ressa alone has 11 criminal charges filed against her, and may be on the verge of going to jail. \"I don't know what's next,\" she told CBS News. \"The best-case scenario is that the government becomes magnanimous in victory, and begins to heal the society, stops the information operations happening online, holds people accountable who are inciting hate. The worst-case scenario is that this kind of overwhelming use of information operations to continue to grow power, continues. And if that happens, our democracy \u2014 I mean, we're going to fundamentally change. And I can see the same thing happening in the United States.\" Though focused on the challenges facing the Philippines, Ressa is also looking beyond its borders.\u00a0 \"The Philippines is a cautionary tale for the United States. The very same things that are happening in the Philippines are happening in the U.S., and the only difference is that institutions in the United States are stronger than in the Philippines,\" she said. In the U.S., three years after the Russian government used Facebook and Twitter to interfere in the 2016 presidential campaign, experts are trying to anticipate what's next.\u00a0 \"People were caught flatfooted by this in 2016 in the U.S. \u2014 the platforms were sort of slow to respond to this,\" said Joshua Tucker, a professor of politics at NYU. \"The government was, you know, not out in front of this. That's not the case right now. Like, everybody's thinking about this.\" But Tucker, who studies disinformation patterns, says disinformation strategies are evolving. The false information spread in 2016 was largely based on text\u2014 mostly fake articles. The fake news of tomorrow, he says, is video. \"We're getting to the point where I can make a video where you say something that you've actually never seen. They're called deepfakes.\" Deepfakes are created with technology that enables someone to take an authentic video, such as a clip of a politician giving a talk, and then manipulate it so that the speaker says whatever the manipulator wants them to. The end result looks and sounds realistic enough that it is difficult for the viewer to notice.\u00a0 This, he says, will only add to the distrust of a public that increasingly doubts what it sees online. Though Tucker believes American democracy is resilient, he is concerned that our focus on foreign meddling may blind us to a future where it is actually domestic players that collectively cause more damage.\u00a0 \"What I worry about is that the legacy of what happened with Russia's interference in 2016 isn't so much as a blueprint for foreign interference in elections as it is a toolkit that all sorts of domestic actors that have interests in affecting election outcomes can begin to use,\" he said. \"So I'm a little bit nervous that this emphasis on preventing foreign interference is going to miss the larger picture.\"\u00a0 Back in Manila, Maria Ressa is also looking at the big picture and how much is truly at stake. \"This is not just about journalism,\" she said. \"This is an existential moment. If nothing changes we will lose democracies.\"",

On Monday, her campaign announced four new endorsements related to the senator's state party convention speech on Saturday, says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Stephanie Ramirez.\u00a0 \"Kamala Harris spoke to us, not at us. She energized and affirmed in me the values that made me become a proud Democrat,\" said Paul Merlo, a volunteer coordinator with the Greenville County Democratic Party, according to a campaign press release.\u00a0 South Carolina is the first test of how well the 2020 candidates will do among African American voters in the 2020 primaries.\u00a0 According to a CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0poll\u00a0released last week, about a third of black voters are considering Harris in the Palmetto state. Former Vice President Joe Biden was leading the pack for his party's nomination among South Carolina Democrats. BETO O'ROURKE:\u00a0The former congressman's new policy proposal aimed at improving the lives of veterans got a\u00a0rare public nod of approval\u00a0from Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. The two lawmakers served together (and sat side by side) on the House Veterans Affairs Committee for six years.\u00a0 SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Sanders introduced a plan to eliminate the $1.6 trillion in student debt currently held by 45 million Americans \u2013 and he's looking to Wall Street to pay for its cost,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0reports. Sanders, along with Reps. Pramila Jayapal, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is proposing a 0.5% tax on all trades, fees on bonds and derivatives. According to Sanders, the tax would raise $2.4 trillion over 10 years. Sanders' debt forgiveness plan goes further than any of his competitors \u2014 most notably, fellow progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren's plan, which caps debt forgiveness at $50,000.\u00a0 SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN:\u00a0Warren's team announced Sunday that the campaign has completed a full organizing tour of Iowa. They've now held organizer-led events in all 99 counties in the state. The campaign told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar and Adam Brewster\u00a0the last county they hit was Adams County, which is in the southwest corner of the state with a population of less than 4,000. The event was held at Background Coffee and Boutique on June 14. President Trump won Adams County with 66% of the vote in the 2016 general election. While Warren has been able to hold organizer-led events in 99 counties, Rep. John Delaney has already visited all 99 himself. UP NORTH:\u00a0In water-quality news, the U.S. Air Force has diverted more than $66 million from other environmental cleanup efforts to address PFAS contamination, with more than $35 million of those dollars dedicated to former Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, NH, says\u00a0Sganga.\u00a0The Concord Monitor also reports\u00a0that New Hampshire's Department of Justice has identified six prominent law firms to represent the state in its lawsuit against major chemical companies \u2014 including 3M, DuPont and the Chemours Company \u2014 concerning PFAS contamination in popular products such as Teflon.\u00a0 DOWN SOUTH:\u00a0South Carolina may be considered the culinary capital of the early presidential primary states (at the very least, it's the only one with a major political event centered around a particular food), but there is one thing voters here aren't hungry for: division in the party,\u00a0report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell,\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice and CBSN political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns. IN THE SENATE:\u00a0Two marquee Senate races got new candidates today,\u00a0report\u00a0Sganga and\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson. In New Hampshire, retired Brigadier General Don Bolduc announced he will be running as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Bolduc told a crowd he has nothing against Shaheen, who has been in the Senate since 2009, but that \"she has been a part of failed leadership in Washington for too long.\" Bolduc also said that he would not \"engage in personal destruction\" as a candidate.\u00a0 In his announcement remarks, Bolduc did not mention President Trump by name and said he would go to Washington to replace \"failed leadership\" that hasn't addressed the opioid crisis, crippling student debt or securing the border.\u00a0 In an interview with CBS News, the two-time Purple Heart recipient applauded Mr. Trump's decision not to retaliate against Iran after the country shot down a U.S. drone. \"Two words,\" the former brigadier general said. \"Effective leadership.\"\u00a0 Asked if he would support Republican efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade, Bolduc told CBS News, \"I'm pro-life.\" The Republican added that he has only three exceptions to this stance: \"Rape, incest and health of the mother.\"\u00a0 In Maine, House Speaker Sara Gideon announced her challenge to unseat incumbent Republican Sen. Susan Collins. In her announcement video, the Democrat criticized Collins' vote on the tax reform bill, receiving donations from drug companies and voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh. ON THE $$$:\u00a0Progressive super PACs Priorities USA and EMILY's List, which works to help elect pro-choice Democratic women, are teaming up in a new push to flip the Virginia General Assembly from red to blue.\u00a0Ewall-Wice\u00a0says the effort will include a $600,000 digital campaign to help persuade and mobilize voters in key districts across the state.\u00a0 At the same time, Tom Steyer's group NextGen America announced Monday it plans to spend $1 million in the state to register and mobilize 12,000 young voters ahead of the state's legislative elections. This comes as Republicans set their sights on Virginia after its Democratic governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general all faced a series of scandals earlier this year. Virginia's election is this November and could serve as a preview for 2020.",

President Trump and the first lady spent Saturday afternoon enjoying one of America's favorite fall pastimes, a college football showdown between two red state rivals, Alabama and LSU. CROWD (in unison): USA. USA. USA. MARGARET BRENNAN: With the first round of open impeachment hearings set to begin Wednesday, House Democrats began laying out their case to impeach the President by releasing thousands of pages of behind closed-doors testimony detailing his administration's attempt to convince Ukraine to investigate the Bidens in exchange for military aid. President Trump is sticking to his claim that he's done nothing wrong. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's all about the transcript. They've having people. I've never even heard of some of these people. I don't know who they are. MARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans put out their own wish list of witnesses, including the whistleblower and Hunter Biden. But they're having a tougher time coming up with a line of defense for Mister Trump. WOMAN #1: Hold on. We have Mark Meadows right here. Congressman Meadows, can we talk-- so he-- he's walking by right now, but Republicans are really struggling to defend the President. Okay, great. MARK MEADOWS: I'm not struggling on anything. WOMAN #1: Okay. So, Congressman-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: So the Republicans are not struggling on anything. MARGARET BRENNAN: Here's the President's top ally in the Senate, Lindsey Graham. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What I can tell you about the Trump policy toward the Ukraine, it was incoherent. It depends on who you talk to. They seem to be incapable of forming a quid pro quo. MARGARET BRENNAN: And this from Louisiana senator, John Kennedy: SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: In terms of the quid pro quo, there are perfectly appropriate quid pro quos, and there are inappropriate prid-- quid pro quos. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with Senator Kennedy, as well as a Democrat from the House Intelligence Committee, California's Eric Swalwell. There is another big event in Washington Wednesday, Turkey's President Erdogan will visit the White House. We'll talk with the new national security advisor, Robert O'Brien. Plus, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is exploring a presidential run, but is America ready for another New York billionaire in the White House? Neither the candidates-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: So, tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires, sorry. You ain't going to buy this election. MARGARET BRENNAN: --nor the Democratic primary voters are convinced. MAN: Have you heard about Michael Bloomberg possibly entering-- WOMAN #2: Yes. I'm just-- just appalled. And I think he was a Republican at one time and then turned Democrat. MARGARET BRENNAN: All that, plus, analysis on news of the week is just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It's a big week here in Washington. So we want to get quickly to our very first guest, Republican Senator John Kennedy, who joins us this morning from Kenner, Louisiana. Good morning, Senator. Congrats on the big win. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R-Louisiana/@SenJohnKennedy/Judiciary Committee): Thank you, Margaret. It was a great game. I'm proud for our-- of our youngsters, but Alabama played a great game, too. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very generous of you there. I want to quickly get to the issue at hand. You heard-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Well, no, I meant it. Actually, I meant it. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm glad. In our show open, you heard a quote from yourself talking about what is appropriate-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and inappropriate in terms of quid pro quos. If a quid pro quo was shown to be for the President's own political benefit, is that appropriate? SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: The-- the quid pro quo, in my judgment, is a red herring. Here-- here are the two possible scenarios. Number one, the President asked for an investigation of a political rival. Number two, the President asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival. The latter would be in the national interest. The former would be in the President's parochial interests and would be over the line. I think this case is going to come down to the President's intent, his motive. Did he have a culpable state of mind? For me, Margaret, there are only two relevant questions that need to be answered. Why did the President ask for an investigation? MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: And number two--and this is inextricably linked to the first question--what did Mister Hunter Biden do for the money? MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you now. There have been more than twenty-five hundred pages of sworn testimony that have been released to the public. Have you read any of those depositions? SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Mm-Hm. I've read some. But any lawyer, in my judgment, who knows a law book from a J. Crew catalog knows that a-- a sterile transcript is no substitute for live witnesses. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: And I thought-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: I thought-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --ask you specific-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: --Speaker Pelosi-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So I just want to ask you, specifically, because of the point you're making-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in terms of differentiating intent, motive, and culpable state of mind. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, a decorated Army officer who gave sworn testimony--it was released this week. He currently works at-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Uh-Huh. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the White House, listened to President Trump's call-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --with the Ukrainian president and he testified, quote, \"There was no doubt that the President was seeking political investigations of political rivals.\" SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is it appropriate to ask foreign governments to investigate Americans? SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Well, it depends on the circumstances. I'm not going to go through the two scenarios that I just gave you, but it depends on the circumstances. And there is-- there, I would say this about the transcript. I can comment on the gentleman's testimony if you let me hear his live testimony. Let me hear the cross-examination. Let me judge his credibility. Let me judge his body language. And also allow the opposing party to call their own witnesses and rebuttal. That's-- that's due process. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Not to-- not only allowing the witnesses you want, as the chairman has done, and then leaking selective portions of it to friendly members of the media who lap it up like a puppy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, all the depositions that-- that I'm quoting from are now publicly released. So it was-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Now they are. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the government that released them. Right. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: But before when they were trying-- but before when they were trying to-- to establish the narrative with the American people, they were selectively leaking. And-- and that's what matters-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, now we're moving into public-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: --here, Margaret, what are the American-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, now the case has got to be made to the American public-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: I'm sorry?  MARGARET BRENNAN: Now the case has to be made to the American public in these public hearings. So is there anything that you could hear from Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, if and when he was called to testify, that would lead you to ever vote for the removal of the President? SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Well, again, I've got to hear-- I've got to hear the testimony. You-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So that means maybe? SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: --You-- you-- if you want to-- if you-- if you assert-- if you try to assess how a trial is going for our-- for our defendant, you don't just listen to the lawyers opening statements and you don't just read the transcript. You sit there and listen to all the testimony, the cross-examination, and the context. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: And I-- I think-- I think that-- that Speaker Pelosi's decision and Adam Schiff's decision to prevent the Republicans from calling their own witnesses in the live testimony is just doubling down on stupid. The American people, I think, are going look at this and go, \"I get it.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: They are going to give the President a fair and impartial firing squad. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: And-- and that's not due process. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're not suggesting here that the witnesses, like Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, lack credibility? SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: I don't know. I can't. I wasn't allowed to hear them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: What I am telling you is that if it can be demonstrated that the President asked for and-- and had the requisite state of mind, that the President asked for an investigation of a political rival, that's over the line. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: But if he asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival that's not over the line. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, over the line, does that mean impeachable? SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Yeah, probably. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there is something you could hear-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: But, again-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --that could potentially persuade you to vote for removal? SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: What? I can't answer that, Margaret, because that-- that-- that-- that encompasses all possible scenarios. That's like asking me if I didn't go fishing Saturday, how many fish will I have caught? All I'm saying is that-- that-- that it ought to be fair. It ought to be public. I read somewhere that democracy dies in darkness. It ought to be public. Both sides ought to be called-- able to call their witnesses in front of God and country and the American people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: And then let the American people decide and-- and the President and his counsel should be allowed to participate. Now, I think that would be fair. And then I-- I will happily judge the evidence. But you can't limit the witnesses, as-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: --Chairman Schiff and Speaker Pelosi's are doing. Selectively leaked portions of the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: --transcript that favor your opinion to friendly members of the press who lap it up like a puppy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: I don't think any fair-minded person in the Milky Way believes that Speaker Pelosi-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: --or Chairman Schiff are impartial here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: So, but they can-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --we look forward to the trial-- SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: --at least follow due process. MARGARET BRENNAN: We look forward to the trial in the Senate. And then seeing what you decide to do, Senator. Thank you for joining us. The question is, of course, with our next guest, the assumption, Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell joins us now, is that when it goes from your committee, from these hearings were about to begin before House intelligence that there will be articles of impeachment voted on that will pass the Democratic-controlled House and then end up in the other side of the court in front of Senator Kennedy there. There will be thirteen Democrats, nine Republicans who get to ask questions in this next round of three diplomats in the coming days. What is going to be different about this? I mean, yeah, cameras are in the room, but is this just show? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL (D-California/@RepSwalwell/Intelligence Committee): Good morning, Margaret. It's important that the President has due process and evidence is not a conclusion. We have enough evidence from the depositions that we've done to warrant bringing this forward, evidence of an extortion scheme, using taxpayer dollars to ask a foreign government to investigate the President's opponent. But it's important that these witnesses raise their right hands and take questions from both Republicans and Democrats. The President is going to get that. It's important that the Republicans be afforded the opportunity to suggest witnesses that we should call and that we determine whether that is relevant, that-- that, you know, the facts are just as important-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: --as the process behind the facts as far as what if anything goes over to the Senate. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you expect anything new from these testimonies or is it going to be a recitation of what we can read in these depositions already? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: These witnesses have been fairly consistent. And for the most part, they've not been coordinating or talking to each other. But, again, this is America. And we don't just have, you know, railroading of justice. These witnesses, you know, should come public-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: --and you know the American people should judge for themselves, as well as we will, as to, you know, what happened here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the issue of witnesses that Senator Kennedy was talking about, the-- the Republican Party put forward yesterday a list of suggested witnesses they would like to see called. On there, Hunter Biden and his business partner. Is it safe to say they will never come before the House Intelligence Committee? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: Well, as Chairman Schiff has said we're not going to go back in time and revisit conspiracy theories that are implicated in the President's call. And you know, it was said-- former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Bossert, who told Jake Tapper a couple of weeks ago that he was telling the President that much of what the President alleged in that phone call to President Zelensky about the Ukrainians involved-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: --in 2016 was just nonsense. And so we don't want to revisit conspiracy theories. If people have relevant information to this investigation and the President's conduct, of course, we want to hear from them. MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's no to the Bidens? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: I'll leave that to the chairman. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: I don't see any relevancy with the Bidens. There's no evidence that any-- anything improper has happened and witnesses have been asked about the Bidens and said that Vice President Biden in every way-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: --these witnesses, in the way they worked with him, conducted himself with integrity. MARGARET BRENNAN: One member of the National Security Council, Tim Morrison, was on the Republican list. Kurt Volker, the former U.S. envoy to Ukraine. Is it safe to assume they will be before your committee? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: You know we're going to handle that this week. You know taking up the Republican witness list and we're going to be fair about it, because, again the fairness behind the process is just as important as the facts. MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote-- talking about the fairness of the process, one of the things that gets criticized by Republicans of Democrats is that the outcome's presupposed. REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: And if you just look back at your own record-- REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --back to the spring, you were calling for impeachment. You wrote an op-ed in June calling for impeachment. That was before this whistleblower ever came to light. REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: You know what's interesting about-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So how can that look fair? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: How can that be fair? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: You know what's interesting about the op-ed I wrote, I wrote it in response to the President's interview with George Stephanopoulos, where he said if he was offered again dirt on a political opponent from a foreign power, he would again take it. I didn't know when I wrote that op-ed that he was already engaging in this manner with the Ukrainians. But his prior conduct with the Russians suggested that he might do that, which is why I thought at that time we have an upcoming election. We want it to be pure and one that is above, you know, any questions. And this President, you know, needs to be held accountable for his actions. MARGARET BRENNAN: National-- former National Security Adviser John Bolton, he has not been subpoenaed. He's deferring to a court to sort of decide who he needs to listen to. The-- the White House tells him not to comply or Congress who has asked him to come and answer questions. Why don't you think you need to hear from him? Why can't you wait until December until a court would decide? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: We'd like to hear from him, but we've heard from three of his deputies who have provided consistent testimony about what was going on in this shakedown scheme. We've asked him to come in, but the White House has told him not to come in. And we're not going to chase witnesses to the courts, because even if a court ruled in December that he has to come in it would be-- it will be appealed to a circuit court of appeals-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: --and then ultimately up to the Supreme Court. We don't have time with an upcoming election that potentially could be compromised by the President's conduct. We need to, you know, move expeditiously but fairly on what we have now. MARGARET BRENNAN: But why expeditiously? Why can't you just wait a few weeks? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: Well, it's not a few weeks. It could be all the way up to a year. And we see this as a tactic by the administration to obstruct our investigation. We also believe if the President believed that John Bolton or Mick Mulvaney could offer testimony that would show that he's innocent he would send them in-- on horses to our committee to testify. They can't. Which is the reason we believe he's obstructing, which goes to a consciousness of guilt. MARGARET BRENNAN: The House Republicans have sort of reshuffled their deck ahead of these hearings and added Congressman Jim Jordan to the committee. And I'm wondering what you think that will do to these public hearing this week. I mean what will this change? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: You know, they-- they could put Johnnie Cochran on their side to ask questions. It's not going to change the facts of this case. Now, if there are going to be stunts, you're going to see again, those stunts will be used by the American people against them to show a consciousness of guilt and a lack of seriousness. I think this is a very serious investigation. This is an opportunity for my Republican colleagues to reset and recognize, also, they're not the public defenders for the President. They don't have to defend him at all costs. They can actually approach this objectively, give him a fair process, ask the right questions and then make a judgment on the facts. But this is not a time for stunts. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, you had been a presidential race contender for 2020. We saw Michael Bloomberg say he may jump into the race, isn't officially declared. What do you think that does to the lineup? REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: It gives the voters more options. But, look, I-- I think options are good and whoever emerges from this will be battle tested. It's going to flush out weaknesses, this large field, and whoever emerges is going to be a very strong candidate to take on and defeat Donald Trump if he's their nominee next year. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. So thank you very much. REPRESENTATIVE ERIC SWALWELL: My pleasure. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in one minute with the new national security adviser to President Trump, the master, Robert O'Brien. Stay with us. It's just ahead. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: This week Turkey's president will be welcomed at the White House. It will be the first meeting since Turkey defied the U.S. by invading Syria, and President Trump abruptly ordered American troops out of that country. Since then President Trump has reversed course, deciding to keep some seven hundred troops on the ground there, down from a total of twelve hundred in all of Syria. CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata is in northeast Syria with an update on their mission. (Begin VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA (CBS News Foreign Correspondent): U.S. troops on patrol here today making their presence known in this region. As we have watched them repositioning around oil facilities, their reach is nearing what it was before President Trump's order to withdraw last month. Right beside their allies the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the ongoing fight against ISIS and while some may argue it's time to bring the troops home top Kurdish commander Mazloum Kobani told us not just yet. What is your message to them? (Mazloum Kobani speaking foreign language) CHARLIE D'AGATA: \"With the Americans, we started a project together, we are partners,\" he said, \"Once this job is done, they can leave. We don't want the Americans to stay here for four hundred years.\" But it is a job that has become much harder in this carved up and congested region. We saw Kurdish protestors pelt a joint Turkish-Russian convoy passing right through the same territory controlled today by U.S. forces. Turkey and Kurdish forces have accused each other of cease-fire violations. And complicating matters further, the Syrian regime has clashed with Turkish troops. None of this would have happened had President Trump not given Turkey the green light to launch its assault on the Kurds in the first place. Can America ever repair the damaged that's been done? (Mazloum Kobani speaking foreign language) CHARLIE D'AGATA: General Kobani said if the Americans break their promise again, the trust will be gone forever. (End VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA: From the top down, ask anybody here whether they can now trust President Trump and they'll say, it's not like we have any choice. This volatile region is now on a knife edge as Turkey's president heads to Washington this week. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's our Charlie D'Agata reporting from northeast Syria. Joining us now to weigh in on Syria and more is the President's National Security Adviser, Robert O'Brien. Good morning to you, Mister Ambassador. ROBERT O'BRIEN (National Security Adviser): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard Charlie lay out a very complicated landscape. Diplomacy means talking to your friends and to your enemies, having difficult conversations. But you just heard everything Charlie laid out. I mean Erdogan defied the United States by invading Syria. He's buying Russian-made weapons. He's doing everything you're telling him not to. Why is he getting rewarded for bad behavior? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, let me just point out, Margaret, that-- that you got it right. And, unfortunately, Charlie got it wrong. When Charlie said we green-lighted the invasion of Syria-- of Syria that's just absolutely false. It didn't happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. moved troops-- ROBERT O'BRIEN: The President-- the President-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --out of the way. ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, the President made it very clear that-- that Turkey shouldn't go in. He even said, \"If you go in, I may have to obliterate your economy.\" He did it on Twitter. He did it on-- on the phone. He did it in a letter that was a very strongly worded letter. So the-- so the idea that the U.S. somehow green lighted Turkey's military operation, that's-- that's just simply false. And-- and the American people shouldn't-- shouldn't believe that. Now, what he did do, we had twenty-eight Green Berets who were at a forward operating post on the border that would have been caught in a crossfire between fifteen thousand Turkish troops and armor and-- and seven or eight thousand YPG SDF troops. And the President was not willing-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Kurdish forces\u2014 ROBERT O'BRIEN: Kurdish forces. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that are allied with the U.S. ROBERT O'BRIEN: Correct. And the President was not going to leave those young men in-- in harm's way in a crossfire. And so he pulled those-- those troops out because it's-- look, it's, ultimately, it's-- it's the President who has to call the families. It's the President who has to go to Dover-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --if something happens. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's why the question is relevant. Why reward that bad behavior? This is a NATO ally who is putting U.S. troops at risk, who is putting U.S. allies at risk. ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, we're not rewarding the behavior. The President promptly put on sanctions, and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And then he took them off. ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, he did because the Turks agreed to a cease-fire. And-- and Turkey said they wouldn't agree to a cease-fire, the President dispatched me and a number of top diplomats--David Satterfield, Jim Jeffrey and then-- then dispatched the Secretary of State and the Vice President to Ankara. And in twenty-four hours, we had a cease-fire. And, by the way, that was a cease-fire that the Kurdish forces had a lot of input into. We want-- we wanted to save lives. We wanted to save Turkish lives. And keep in mind there were Turkish civilians being killed and-- and rocketed by the Kurds. There were Kurdish folks being killed, including Turkish soldiers. We got a cease-fire. And-- and in a short amount of time, we got those Kurdish soldiers evacuated to-- to a safe area. So I think the Kurds appreciated the cease-fire. I think the Turks did as well. And that was a-- a real diplomatic coup from the President because he-- because of his tough line. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you recognize that there were war crimes committed? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Look, it-- some of the things that we've seen are very disturbing, and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: By Turkey-- ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --and Turkish-supported militias? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Maybe the Turkish-supported militias. Turkey has assured us that those are being investigated. We're very concerned about those issues, the war crimes issues. We're watching them. We're monitoring it very closely. There is no place for genocide, for ethnic cleansing, for war crimes in the twenty-first century. The U.S. won't stand by for it and-- and we've made that position very clear to the Turks. MARGARET BRENNAN: If Congress passes any of the at least three sanctions bills on Turkey that are going to get bipartisan support, will the President veto all of them? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Look, we'll have to see what-- what happens this week with our meetings with President Erdogan. I mean there are-- there are things that, Turkey's a member of NATO. Turkey plays a very important geopolitical role for-- for our friends in Europe, for ourselves. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ROBERT O'BRIEN: They-- they sit astride the Bosporus-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --the strait that goes into the Black Sea. We have NATO allies, Romania and Bulgaria that are Black Sea powers. So-- so losing Turkey as-- as an ally is not something that's good for the Europe-- for Europe or for the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk-- ROBERT O'BRIEN: And-- and we're going to-- we're going to work on making sure that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --we can do our very best to keep them as a-- as a NATO member. MARGARET BRENNAN: More to talk about your portfolio in a moment. We have to take a break. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MAN: Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican of Wisconsin faced the nation with correspondents across the country questioning him. Live from Indianapolis, New York City, and also here in Washington. Here is the moderator of FACE THE NATION, Ted Koop. TED KOOP: How do you do? And welcome to FACE THE NATION. MARGARET BRENNAN: That was the very first episode of FACE THE NATION, sixty-five years ago this week. And, as you can see, we had a couple of technical glitches right at the start. Technology has certainly changed, but our commitment here at FACE THE NATION has not. For sixty-five years we've done our best to give our viewers not only the news they need to know but to help educate and give them context about what's important and why in a fair, straightforward way. We'll have more thoughts on our mission here at FACE THE NATION over the years in our next half hour. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but we will be right back with more from Ambassador O'Brien and our political panel. So stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation with Ambassador Robert O'Brien, national security adviser to President Trump. I-- I want to pick up on this idea where we left it with Turkey coming. And they are a NATO ally, as you emphasized. One of our NATO allies, the French President, Emmanuel Macron, said this week that NATO is suffering a brain death because of lack of American support and resolve. From what he is seeing and then what we're seeing with Turkey causing these cracks in the alliance, I mean you must be very concerned. Is that why you've brought the NATO secretary general to the White House this week as well? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, we have a NATO summit coming up the third and fourth of December. So, we'll be in London for that summit. I think-- I think it's going to be a good summit between NATO allies. NATO's an important alliance to us. But, look, I think the cracks of that have formed in the alliance are because we have members of the alliance that aren't paying their fair share, that aren't spending money on defense. I mean the-- the United States taxpayer and-- and the taxpayer of eight of the NATO country-- taxpayers of eight of the NATO countries that are spending their two percent on national defense. We spend over four percent. They're doing the right things. But there are a bunch of countries, including Germany and others, that-- that aren't paying their fair share. It's not-- it's not right for the American taxpayer to have to defend these countries that don't want to defend themselves. So-- so, the President has been very-- very strong on this issue. There's been a hundred billion dollars in new NATO defense spending since he took office. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ROBERT O'BRIEN: It's a great accomplishment of President Trump. I think the Americans are happy about it. I think most Europeans are happy about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Emmanuel Macron was voicing out loud some real concerns. And if you look at what Turkey has done, as you just described, you thought that there was a potential NATO ally would fire on the United States, intentionally or not, in Syria. You've also seen Turkey go ahead and buy Russian-made weapons in defiance of NATO. ROBERT O'BRIEN: Yeah, we're-- we're very upset about that. And we've made-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Can-- can you get behind sanctions on them? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean they are supposed to be triggered by Congress. ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, look-- look, if-- if Turkey doesn't get rid of the S-400, I mean, there will likely be sanctions. The CAATSA sanctions will-- will pass Congress with an overwhelming bipartisan majority and Turkey will feel the impact of those sanctions. We-- we've made that very clear to President Erdogan. There's no place in NATO for the S-400. There's no place in NATO for significant Russian military purchases. That's a message that the President will deliver to him very clearly when he's here in Washington. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you're just back from Asia. The President says he wants to meet with Xi Jinping and possibly get a trade deal by December. Is that a hard date on the calendar? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Look, there-- there's no deadline. We want to get a good deal. And I think we're very close to getting a phase one trade deal. And it will be the first time that we've had a trade deal where China has actually respected the United States and-- and hasn't, you know, stole our intellectual property, has been fair and reciprocal in trade. So, if we can get a good deal, then we'll get a good deal. I think we're very close. And I think if there is a deal, the President and President Xi, will-- will get together and sign it. Look, we want great relations with China, but this is the first President that stood up to China that-- that has been, you know, stealing American intellectual property. Not all American companies that have access to Chinese markets engage in unfair trade practices. That has to come to an end because the Chinese have been using that to fill-- to-- to fund one of the most massive military buildups in history. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ROBERT O'BRIEN: And-- and-- and you know, that has to come to a stop. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I just said, you're back from Asia. You've been raising concerns about China's militarization, particularly of the South China Sea. I mean this only seems to be escalating militarily. ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, I don't think it's escalating militarily. I think the President has put tariffs on-- on China. We've always-- and-- and those tariffs have led the Chinese to the negotiating table. And I think we're going to get a pretty good deal for the American people, especially for the American farmers, for owners of intellectual property. MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- so you see a trade deal going ahead and what you're talking about in terms of militarization in the South China Sea, that kind of thing is not going to complicate? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Look, we're-- we're going to still stand up and I did at the ASEAN summit at the East Asia Summit I made it very clear that that just because one country is big and other countries are small in the region, the bigger countries shouldn't bully the smaller countries and-- and take their resources, whether they are fishery resources or oil and gas resources. And the U.S. Navy will continue to have freedom of navigation operations through the South China Sea. This nine-dash-line or cow's tongue that the Chinese have-- have-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --drawn around the entire South China Sea, which is a major swath of the Pacific Ocean, and claimed it as internal waters, as if it was Lake Tahoe or something, that just can't stand. The United States Navy won't put up with it, the-- the countries in the regions-- region won't put up with it. And-- and all those countries, with-- with very few exceptions, were grateful because-- that America is standing up for them, standing up for their resource patrimony. That's the future for their kids and their grandkids with the oil and gas and the fisheries, the minerals off their shores, China shouldn't be allowed to take it just because they are bigger. MARGARET BRENNAN: You on Ukraine. I know you were not at the White House when this July twenty-fifth phone call happened. That is now at the heart of this impeachment inquiry. But you are now part of Ukraine policymaking. You heard Senator Graham at the top of the program say the policy is completely incoherent. Will the U.S. continue lethal military aid to Ukraine until Russia backs out of Crimea and stops supporting separatists in Ukraine? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, look, I think you put your finger on the most-- most important issue, and that's lethal military aid. I was in Ukraine in 2014. I was there to observe the elections in Ukraine. I was there as part of a bipartisan election observation mission and I had young Ukrainian soldiers and young Ukrainians come up to me and say, why won't the U.S., the arsenal of demo-- democracy, send us lethal aid? You're sending us blankets and MREs. Why won't-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --President Obama send us military aid? MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Trump changed-- ROBERT O'BRIEN: And-- and there-- and there-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --policy by doing that. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --and there was no military aid going to-- to the Ukrainians under the-- the-- the Obama-Biden administration. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ROBERT O'BRIEN: When President Trump got into office, he sent military aid. So I think what people ought to be focusing on is the President has been helping the-- the Ukrainians defend themselves by sending them lethal-- lethal military aid to stand up to the Russians. That's the real story that's been lost in all this. MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the-- is the policy, though, that? That that lethal aid will continue until Russia stops backing separatists and-- and trying to annex parts of Ukraine? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about what could happen down the road. I mean, hopefully, Russia and Ukraine can get along and there can be some sort of a peace treaty and-- and an agreement between them. So I'm not going to commit the United States to what we're going to do forever. But-- but for right now, we're set. We're-- we're the first administration. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ROBERT O'BRIEN: President Trump is the first President to send lethal military aid to Ukraine. I think it's very important. And I think that's something that's been lost in-- in all the hullabaloo about the-- about the telephone call. And one other thing I'd say about this, I've been with President Trump in two dozen conversations, either in person or on the phone with foreign leaders. And if the American people could be on those phone calls, they'd be extraordinarily proud of the President, how he represents America, the cordiality that he-- he has with world leaders-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --but also the tough message that he has to-- to protect U.S. interests. I mean, they'd-- they'd be proud of what their President does in those meetings with foreign leaders. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, who has testified under oath, is serving on the National Security Council currently. Will he continue to work for you despite testifying against the President? ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well-- well, look, one of the things that I have talked about is that we're streamlining the National Security Council. It got bloated to like two hundred and thirty-six people from-- up from a hundred in the Bush administration under President Obama. We're streamlining the National Security Council. There are people that are detailed from different departments and agencies. My understanding is he is-- is-- that Colonel Vindman is-- is detailed from the Department of Defense. So everyone who's detailed at the NSC, people are going to start going back to their own departments-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --and we'll bring in new folks. But we're going to get that number down to around a hundred people. That's what it was under Condoleezza Rice. She came and met with me. I met with a number of my successors. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ROBERT O'BRIEN: We don't need to recreate the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security over at the White House. We've got great diplomats and soldiers and-- and folks that can-- that do that work for us in the departments. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to button that up, though. You're saying Colonel-- Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is scheduled to rotate out. You are not suggesting in any way that there will be retaliation against him? ROBERT O'BRIEN: I-- I-- I never retaliated against anyone. So the-- the-- it's like-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But his time is coming to an end? ROBERT O'BRIEN: There-- there will be a point for-- for everybody who's detailed there-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --that their time, that their detail will come to an end. They will go back to their agency. And what we want them to do is take the experience and skills they learned at the White House, take it back to their departments and agencies and-- and do an even better job there. And-- and so we're-- we're grateful that we can have these detailees come in, and they will come spend the year-- a year or, you know, maybe a little bit more at the White House-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --and then they will go back to their agency. And-- and they will do a better job at their agency-- MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. ROBERT O'BRIEN: --having been at the White House. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much-- ROBERT O'BRIEN: Thank you for having me, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: --Ambassador O'Brien for joining us. Appreciate it. We'll be right back with our panel. Don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to some political analysis from our panel. Stephen Hayes is the editor of The Dispatch and a Fox News contributor, Margaret Talev is the White House and politics editor at Axios, Jeffrey Goldberg is the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, and Antjuan Seawright is a Democratic strategist and CBS News contributor. Good to have you all here. STEPHEN HAYES (The Dispatch/@stephenfhayes): Good to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Impeachment seems to be sucking the oxygen out of everything here in Washington. Stephen, I want to begin with you because I know you think that this is a bad week for Republicans. But you don't think outside the Beltway this is resonating. STEPHEN HAYES: I don't. I don't think it's really resonating. If you look at the way that Republicans in Congress are reacting to this, it's almost with a shrug off the shoulders. We-- we saw these transcripts come out. If you spent time reading the two-thousand-plus pages of the transcripts, tremendously damaging to the argument that Republicans have made for the past six weeks in defense of the President. One by-- one by one, you saw all of these defenses of the President on substances fall away, where it's clear that there was this quid pro quo that Democrats and others have been alleging. Republicans don't have an answer for it, as I think was-- was evident in your interview with Senator Kennedy. MARGARET BRENNAN: He said it depends on the kind of quid pro quo. STEPHEN HAYES: Yeah. But he-- he sketched out the scenario where he had, on the one hand, the-- the President might have been doing this because he had some vague interest in corruption broadly. But you have to-- just take a step back and think about what that means. I mean, this is a President who has had friendly relations with leaders of tremendously corrupt countries, where he was talking about Egypt or Russia or Saudi Arabia, or Turkey who wants to bring troops home, who is an America Firster. But he suddenly had such an interest in corruption in this one country, in Ukraine, that he sent his personal attorney to conduct investigations that happened to overlap, coincidentally, with the interests-- his political interests, in-- in that they were investigating two of his chief political rivals. It doesn't even pass the leftist. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Margaret, why-- why then is that not more clear to the public? If it is so clear, as Stephen laid out there, is it that what these public hearings will change? MARGARET TALEV (Axios/@margarettalev): Well, the public hearings can only change people's minds of people who watch the public hearings and are engaged in them or read about them. And I think it's pretty clear from the early weeks of this that-- that President Trump's base is not shaken or thwarted by this. And so really the issue is the group we're going to be hearing a lot about in the next several months, which is the suburban voters, right? These are the-- you-- if you call them moderate voters or swing voters or suburban voters, somewhere in that circle is-- is this group of people. We saw the relevance of suburban voters in Virginia in the elections, perhaps to some extent in Kentucky. And this is the group that both Democrats and President Trump are now going to be fighting for because they are the people who are engaged in-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARGARET TALEV: --you know, in sort of the daily business that involves paying attention to more details like this. And they are the people who are most likely to be at a workstation, at work, with the TV on, absorbing the contents of this, trying to figure out whether they are uncomfortable enough about it that they won't vote for President Trump twice. MARGARET BRENNAN: Antjuan, how do Democrats avoid what happened with the Robert Mueller hearings, where there was this big buildup, and the idea that if he testifies publicly he will describe in vivid detail what people didn't bother to read in print? Well, how is this going to be different? ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT (Democratic Strategist/@antjuansea/CBS News Contributor): I think we have to first come to the real-- realization that Donald Trump and his disciples have no interest in having a relationship with the truth, regardless of whether it is public or whether they actually read it and can see it. Number two, I think Democrats have to block and tackle. Block out this arguments or this distraction that the Republicans want to draw them into, and really tackle the issues that matter to the American people while they also pass legislation that they promised the American people in 2018, and remind people that is-- the Senate is-- the holdup is the problem, and everything goes McConnell's graveyard to die. If we fail to do that, we will be sentenced again to two years in the hard time as the minority party. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it's going well? ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: I-- it's hard to say. Look, here's what I do know, the Republicans demonstrated what I believe to be a political pump fake about transparency during this process when you have forty-seven or forty-eight members of their conference, a part of these hearings, now they're public and you have leaders like Senator Graham and others who want to press the ignore button on the fact they're going to be transparent and, essentially, are saying regardless of what comes out, no matter who says it like a decorated military official, it's not true because it's anti-Donald Trump. And we've seen this movie before and that's why I think Democrats have to stay focused on the things that matter outside of the bubble. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeffrey, who's actually winning on the messaging here and convincing the American public, because that's what these public hearings are going to be focused on? JEFFREY GOLDBERG (The Atlantic/@JeffreyGoldberg): I think it's actually-- this sounds very journalistic, but I think it's too early to tell. We don't know what dynamic we-- we enter when we actually see these people live in front of the cameras and how many people are watching, and how convincing it is. I mean, on the one hand, we'll know the answer to that question, I think, not so much, I mean we'll know it when we see what people in the suburbs feel about it. We'll also really know the answer if we see Re-- Republicans become less cohesive. If there's one person, one person with influence in the Republican Party on the Hill who says, you know what, the emperor really doesn't have his clothes on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: That could sort of break this open a little bit because all of us, I think, up here talk to Republicans on the Hill who privately say this is a disaster, a moral disaster, a political disaster, an ethical disaster, and they are just holding on and they're coming up with these talking points that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: --that you saw on your show today. But there's a belief and maybe this is an overoptimistic belief in the part of Trump's opponents that there are people there who will say enough is enough when they hear it from-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: --as you say, a decorated war veteran. This is actually what happens when they hear it from-- from serious professionals in the State Department. They might just say enough. ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: But, Margaret, here's the one thing Democrats and-- and Republicans agree on-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: --the interests of national security. And I think if Democrats use that as their North Star or their foundation about this being about national security in the future of this country, I think that is a point that no one can argue. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in the meantime, the-- the split screen will be these hearings happening on Capitol Hill while the President is meeting with another world leader that he is dealing with national security. I-- I was pressing, Jeffrey, the national security adviser on why Turkey's leader deserves the honor of walking into the White House and after-- after listing all of the things that Turkey has done wrong. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. And-- and, as you know, there's a hope in Washington that simply that Erdogan leaves without having his bodyguards beat up people as happened the last time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that's what happened. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: We have lower standards for this visit than we usually have. We're just like let's not-- not have street violence associated with this visit. No, this-- the-- the-- the reception of Erdogan this week doesn't make any sense from a national security perspective. Are you rewarding-- remember, we always talk about rewarding people with an Oval Office visits, is this the person who deserves an Oval Office visit? No, of course, not, but nothing is particularly coherent in our national security strategy right now. So it makes as much sense as anything else in this kind of topsy-turvy world in which we live. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were referring to in 2017 when American protesters were beaten up. There are U.S. Marshals' arrest warrants-- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --out for some of Turkey's Erdogan's bodyguards. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll see if they show up on this visit. We'll be back in a moment with a lot more from our panel. Don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with more from our political panel. Stephen, I want to start off with you, the journal has a-- an op-ed and, you know, their op-ed pages are often thought to be fairly conservative-- STEPHEN HAYES: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: --so when they say Bloomberg, water's warm, jump right in to Michael Bloomberg suggesting he get into this 2020 race and that it might be a good idea. Should Democrats be skeptical of that somewhat endorse-- endorsement? STEPHEN HAYES: Sounds a good trick. It-- it-- it is a little trick. Look, I think Democrats probably should be skeptical of Michael Bloomberg for-- for a number of reasons, most especially because he's done this before. I mean we've had how many head fakes from Michael Bloomberg. And he's also, you know, he was a Democrat, Republican, independent. He sort of covered the gamut. And I think you're hearing this from people like Elizabeth Warren, people like Bernie Sanders who I think are more in touch with the-- the-- sort of base of the Democratic Party that this is not the-- the Democratic savior that-- that people think he is. MARGARET BRENNAN: But is he the kind of candidate who could convince Republicans to crossover and vote for him? STEPHEN HAYES: Well, I think conceivably, I mean, he certainly has some nanny-state aspects to him that I think would make conservatives uncomfortable. But I think the immediate impact is much likely to have the opposite effect where he-- he dilutes support potentially for Joe Biden, he could block a path forward for others who are running in the so-called moderate lane like Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and others. So I think if you're Elizabeth Warren today and you see Michael Bloomberg getting and you're happy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. Antjuan, you know, being a self-made billionaire, successful businessperson can look at that and says it's the American dream, or you can look at that and say this person is suspect and it seems that this person is suspect is what we're hearing more on the campaign trail, and that isn't comfortable for everyone. ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: I'm not going to criticize him for making money, but let me say four things about Bloomberg. Number one, most people will agree that the political highway is experiencing a traffic jam, because we have too many people running for President on our side and most of the lanes are filled at this point. The second point is that it's Sunday morning, so I'll say this: there's a political scripture that I referenced, it says the road to heaven and the White House runs through South Carolina. Well, he has agreed that he will not participate in the South Carolina primary with sixty-one percent of the people who vote-- cast a vote will be African-American, fifty-five percent women, most of the states that follow reflects South Carolina. South Carolina was a launch pad for Barack Obama and a safe haven for Hillary Clinton. MARGARET BRENNAN: Also your home state. ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: Oh, God's country. And-- and then the third thing, it is the home of the most prominent and powerful African-American in the U.S. Congress, Jim Clyburn. And so what Bloomberg is saying by not participating in South Carolina primary, if he gets in, is that I have no interest in what majority of African-Americans think in the south and especially the home of whip Jim Clyburn. That's what I think he's making a mistake and I call it the highest act of malpractice in the campaign can commit. MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow. Margaret. MARGARET TALEV: Well, I mean there are a lot of reasons why a bid would be complicated and I think we're not sure, yet, that he is going to run. There is no way to secretly check the box in Alabama without people-- STEPHEN HAYES: Right. MARGARET TALEV: --finding out. But-- but they're-- they're-- the case to be made if he did pursue it is that what he's done with his billions of dollars is invest in two of the most important issues to Democrats on climate change and on gun control, right, that he's got support in Wall Street, he's got some support in Silicon Valley as well. And that when you look at the results of last Tuesday's election, there-- there may be a market of people in the general election, maybe, that would be receptive to a message like his. But, you know, the-- there is also an overarching lesson from the 2016 race, which is that when you have a seventeen-way or an eighteen-way or a nineteen-way primary, somebody who did not have a chance in a three-way race-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MARGARET TALEV: --could have a chance. STEPHEN HAYES: Right. MARGARET TALEV: And that is all part of the calculus. ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: But you can't-- you cannot leave-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And he's got the-- ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: --the Democratic nominee without having strong across the board, broad deep and wide support among African-American voters, he doesn't have that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeffrey. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: But I-- I do want to say one thing in his defense or in the theoretical defense of this candidacy, unlike the other billionaires who are really vanity candidates this is a proven election winner. I mean, this is a three-time mayor of New York City. MARGARET BRENNAN: As a Democrat, Republican and independent. It will make it perfect. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: I mean-- I mean he's covered all the bases. I mean so-- so he has overcome a first hurdle. He's actually gone before voters and gotten votes and by many accounts that had a largely successful run-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: --as-- as mayor. So I think it does put him in a slightly different lane than just the pure vanity, billionaire fast lane. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- MARGARET TALEV: But it is the Biden-- but it is the Biden lane. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MARGARET TALEV: And it-- and it complicates that contest inextricably. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thanks to all of you for the analysis. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Sixty-five years ago, the very first guest on FACE THE NATION was Senator Joe McCarthy. A politician who rose to prominence on the audacious claim that communists had infiltrated the U.S. State Department. The hearings and blacklisting that followed are looked back on as a dark period in American history. It serves as a good reminder that it is not entirely new to have this anger, vitriol, and divisiveness in our country's politics. And looking back at the world leaders who have appeared on this program through the years, I am also reminded that upheaval and change are constant even if they are disorienting. These days you've never had so many options at your fingertips to quickly receive information or disinformation. Talk is cheap, and you can get an opinion just about anywhere. FACE THE NATION has always been a place for listening to each other, which we all need to do a bit more of in our current climate, and for context and perspective. That's what our team here at FACE THE NATION will continue to try to do each Sunday. And at sixty-five years old, we're in our prime. We want to wish the United States Marine Corps a very happy birthday. They turned two hundred and forty-four today. We honor all who currently or previously served in the armed forces and their families on this Veterans Day weekend. Thank you all for keeping America safe. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I am Margaret Brennan.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "In this episode of Intelligence Matters, host Michael Morell speaks with Chris Johnson, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former CIA senior China analyst, about the state of play in U.S.-China relations. Johnson offers a portrait of President Xi, who has consolidated power and alliances domestically and throughout the region, and discusses the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to make its own case globally. Johnson and Morell also discuss the latest on the emerging U.S.-China trade deal, Beijing's response to the Hong Kong protests, and the attention paid overseas to the ongoing impeachment inquiry in the U.S. INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - CHRIS JOHNSON CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL MORELL PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, welcome to the show. It is great to have you back on Intelligence Matters. This is your third time on the show. CHRIS JOHNSON: Third time's the charm. MICHAEL MORELL: That sets (LAUGH) a record, by the way, for-- CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, thank you. MICHAEL MORELL: --for most times on the podcast. So, congratulations. CHRIS JOHNSON: Glad to be back. MICHAEL MORELL: So, you just returned from a trip to Beijing? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yup. MICHAEL MORELL: And there's a lot going on, so there's plenty to talk about. But let me start by asking you about your trips to China. CHRIS JOHNSON: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). MICHAEL MORELL: How often do you go? How long do you stay? Do you also get around the region as well as to China? What kinds of people do you talk to? How does all that work? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah. Well, I go multiple times per year. No fewer than six or seven and sometimes ten or 11. So, I'm over there a lot. I just find in the current conditions, and especially sort of the ecosystem that Xi Jinping has created, it's much easier to go and talk to people. You know, it's just very difficult to try to gain insight from travelers or from just reading the media or things like that. I do often travel in the region as well when I'm out there. But mainly, I make a point when I'm in China, of also trying to get out of the major cities, either Beijing or Shanghai, and make sure that I'm going to some more far-flung province. Because you really can't get a good picture of the country if you're only hanging out in the main municipalities. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. CHRIS JOHNSON: And speak to a range of people while I'm there. Long-term contacts of mine. Obviously, with my affiliation with CSIS, oftentimes it's attending conferences and things like that. So, talk to academics, talk to officials, things like that, to try to gain insight. MICHAEL MORELL: You set up these things yourself? There isn't-- CHRIS JOHNSON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. There's not somebody in China who sets up all these meetings for you-- CHRIS JOHNSON: No, and if I get a conference invitation, obviously, they take care of that part. But yeah, I'll set up my own meetings, exactly. MICHAEL MORELL: So, when you're in China, do you ever feel pressure, direct or subtle, for how you talk about China when you're back here? CHRIS JOHNSON: No. I've not had that experience. I think maybe some others have. But I have not, in my experience. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So, with that in mind, what's your take on the recent issue between the NBA and the Chinese? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah, my sense-- MICHAEL MORELL: How do you think about that? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, my sense is that you hear different versions. And it's interesting, I think the overarching point is it's troubling, right. It's troubling for U.S. companies. It's troubling for U.S. citizens who are here and trying to express themselves freely on social media and so on. And the Chinese government can use its market power to silence people. I mean, if you look at what happened in that episode, the NBA clearly handled it poorly from a PR point of view. But you look at several NBA stars who basically came out very directly and said this is money versus freedom and I'm choosing money. So, that was quite striking. In terms of how it went down or what happened, you hear different versions. I think what we have seen of recent is that the Chinese propaganda organ's in something of a change. And we'll talk perhaps a little bit about what's going on domestically. Now, increasingly are the voice of how China responds to international concerns, international criticism or just developments, instead of the foreign ministry, right, so the diplomats who one would expect (who have the nuance and so on), they're just kind of reading off a sheet that the propaganda department gives them. And that's a big change. And obviously, then, there's oftentimes the likelihood that it'll be overplayed. So, for example, my understanding is that the propaganda organs kind of led with their face and got out over their skis and President Xi actually was not very happy with how that went. And you can kind of see that in the arc of the story in China. You know, big spike of fervor and then silent very quickly thereafter. MICHAEL MORELL: So, is the difference between the foreign ministry commenting on an issue and the propaganda arm essentially telling them what to say is the propaganda arm is thinking about the Chinese domestic audience and the diplomats would be thinking about a foreign audience? Is that-- CHRIS JOHNSON: That's part of it. I think it's just also propagandas are, by nature, more nationalistic, more conservative, certainly more ideological, right, than your average diplomat who might be more cosmopolitan-- MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. Okay, Chris, politics in China. CHRIS JOHNSON: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). MICHAEL MORELL: Several questions. One we talked about the other day when we saw each other, and that's President Xi's political position. CHRIS JOHNSON: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). MICHAEL MORELL: How would you describe it? Is he in any political difficulty, which is a thing one hears from time to time? How do you think about that? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah. It's my opinion from this trip and just really from (UNINTEL) effect that President Xi remains, shall we say, large and in charge inside the system. There is obviously grumbling about some of the things he does. As we've discussed before on the podcast, there are concerns about the removal of term limits on the presidency. There are concerns about the failure to signal the succession. And in fact, as we saw in the plenum, the fourth plenum that was concluded last week, there was a lotta speculation that maybe the succession may be signaled and that there would be promotions to the Politburo standing committee, one or two people, something like this, that would signal a succession. But it didn't happen. (LAUGH) And I think really that's the best indicator of Xi Jinping's strength. I mean, unfortunately, the problem with whispers, right, is that they're hard to do away with. So, my guess is even with positive observable fact, strong facts like that, these rumors will continue, primarily because the economy is slowing, Hong Kong is a problem, which I'm sure we'll discuss, and other factors. And there's just a lotta people who don't like what Xi Jinping is doing. But we forget sometimes that there are a lotta people who do. MICHAEL MORELL: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). Can you describe him as a person? CHRIS JOHNSON: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). MICHAEL MORELL: His mindset, how he thinks about things? CHRIS JOHNSON: My general sense is he is someone who is ideological. He's a true Marxist. I think he has a certain sense of himself as a man of history. We see that quite a bit in terms of this equating of his personal rule with China's rise. And in fact, I think really the more subtle domestic gambit that he's been up to in the last several months, and it's playing out over time, is to kind of formalize this inseparable link between his personal rule and the rise of China. And we see that manifesting itself in several ways, one of which is this occasional references to him probably building towards some sort of formal designation of Xi Jinping as the people's leader. And then of course, equating the people with the party. (LAUGH) So, the people are those who support the party, and those who do not are not the people. And that's a very interesting sort of dance that we're seeing going on. I think-- MICHAEL MORELL: You tie everything together? CHRIS JOHNSON: Correct, exactly. And the forge, if you will, on which he's making this chain is this idea of struggle, right. He gave a big speech. He's given two actually this year talking about these struggles and they cover all the areas, very diverse areas, that one might expect. The struggle against environmental degradation, the struggle to become self-sufficient in technology, and of course, the struggle against Western values and the U.S. Cold War attitude is something that we often hear from Xi. And then I would just emphasize as well one thing that's interesting about him. We see a lot of comparisons now to Mao Zedong or even Stalin. I guess my problem with those comparisons is that those people were whimsical people. Xi Jinping is not whimsical. He's pragmatic. I think he approaches things in a very sort of thoughtful, measured way. And in fact, that might make him harder to deal with. Whimsical people, you can head fake. MICHAEL MORELL: So, what is his vision of China in the world? CHRIS JOHNSON: I think basically the main piece is they're trying to make the world safe for the Chinese Communist Party, if you will. In other words, they have a system. They believe it works for them. They look at the track record of recent, both of their own system and some of the struggles, let's face it, that the democratic systems have been having. And their view is they should be allowed to pursue that system. And so, it's a helpful way of framing it, I think, because it does show us that there's a challenge from China, no question, in that they're seeking to sort of proselytize a narrative, just like we have our own narratives about freedom and democracy and so on. They have theirs about the effectiveness of their system. But it also suggests that there are some limits to their ambition. In other words, they may not necessarily want to overturn the rules-based global order. They just want to mess it up. (LAUGH) And in fact, that could be even more troubling, right? In other words, if they don't have a plan to replace the rules-based global order but would rather just see it messy, that's bad for everyone. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So, is it a way to think about it as follows -- And correct me if I'm wrong. But in terms of their international relationships, if it's all about supporting the party, at the end of the day, and the party's position at home, is it to get out of those relationships as much as you can economically? Because that, at the end of the day, is what supports the party? CHRIS JOHNSON: That's a big part of it, for sure. And I think also, though, it is this idea of trying to legitimize China's international role and, again, the validity of their system. So, when we look at what they're doing at the U.N., for example, where they're trying to inject certain of their key phrases, such as the community of shared prosperity for humanity, and things of this nature, that's an effort as well to kind of gain international legitimacy without democratization. They're finding it's a fairly difficult trick, actually. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So, what's different? What's different with Xi Jinping from his predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin? Particularly in terms of China's role in the world, how do you think about that? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah. I mean, I think certainly in the Jiang era, and also in the Hu era, we saw the remnants, if you will, of Deng Xiaopeng's old adage about hiding your capabilities and biding your time, right. In other words, keep a low profile internationally. Don't stick your head up. Xi Jinping has definitely done away with that. We see that most clearly in the work report that came from the last party congress, the 19th Party Congress, where really, for the first time since the Cultural Revolution, as I said earlier, they suggested they have a model that might be applicable outside of China. So, I think that's a huge difference. Then, I think another significant difference, obviously, is those guys were sort of struggling within the confines of a highly collectivized leadership system. So, therefore, lowest common denominator international policies tended to come out the other end. Xi Jinping has a lot more freedom of action. Sometimes that can be good in terms of moving certain things forward. Sometimes it can be bad in that there's sort of a hastiness on occasion-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right, right. CHRIS JOHNSON: --to his actions. MICHAEL MORELL: Right, right. So, he set himself up to stay in power for a long time? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: How long do you expect? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, there's a lot of controversy over that. Obviously, by removing the term limits, technically he can be president for life. My own sense is that the third term, so the next round, is pretty likely. He'll be able to make a case, I think, that there's a lot of unfinished business, that this is a critical period for China's modernization and this new long march that he's talked about, for example. But once you get past that, I suspect there will start to be a lot more agitation from various groupings within the party. I mean, he has effectively suppressed factionalism within the system. But that doesn't mean it's not still there, and that folks have attitudes and so on. So, we've got at least five more years. Let's put it that way. MICHAEL MORELL: And as you said earlier, there is no indication that he's grooming a successor? CHRIS JOHNSON: If he is, he's not indicating it. One presumes he has this in the back of his mind and is certainly thinking about it. That's another domestic significant difference. Previously, you know, a new party secretary would be chosen. They would serve a first term. Then they would get a second term. And in that second term, the successor would be pretty clearly identified. That did not happen at the last party congress. MICHAEL MORELL: You said something earlier that was interesting, right, that people compare him to Mao or Stalin, and those aren't great comparisons. Is there a current leader in the world or a leader from history that you think he is comparable to? CHRIS JOHNSON: That's a tough one. MICHAEL MORELL: That's a tough question, I know. CHRIS JOHNSON: Not off the top of my head. I mean, I think actually, in a way, you can argue he's a fusion, maybe of a bunch of different people. I mean, obviously, he has certain tendencies that remind us a bit of Putin. They get along very well. They celebrate birthdays together (LAUGH) and so-- MICHAEL MORELL: Kinda weird. CHRIS JOHNSON: That is kinda weird but they do. And I think what they see in each other is basically each other. And that's why the relationship is good. So, when they look at each other, they see a strong and confident person like they are; someone who's very committed to the system in their country like they are; and more importantly, will go to the mattresses for that system. And then also the issue of color revolutions, of course, which is something that really binds them together. And then I think also sometimes, in terms of his pragmatism or at least his political skill, maybe a Richard Nixon or even an Angela Merkel who has managed to survive very long in German politics and stay in power a long time. That's his sort of more pragmatic side, from my point of view-- MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, interesting. Interesting. Okay, the trade dispute-- CHRIS JOHNSON: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). MICHAEL MORELL: --between the United States and China. There's an announced agreement on the outlines of some sort of phase one? CHRIS JOHNSON: Correct. MICHAEL MORELL: Although, nobody's quite sure exactly (LAUGH) what's in that. CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: What's your sense of how the Chinese think about where we are at this moment in the trade dispute? CHRIS JOHNSON: My sense is they would like to see some progress on a phase one deal. They would like, I think, to see the issue of tariffs addressed. We have sort of three batches really of the tariffs. There's a threatened set of tariffs that will come into place on December 15th. There's some existing batch from September 1st that we're in. And then, of course, there's the original $250 billion in tariffs. I think the Chinese desire is to-- definitely the December 15th is out. They think Trump won't do that because it's so close to Christmas. Eliminate that September tariff and see what they can do on that original 250. And of course, Ambassador Lighthizer is kind of dead set against that last bit. So, it will be interesting to see. In terms of the broader picture, I think one thing that's striking is that if you look at the basic content of a phase one deal, while it doesn't hurt China much, they're just buying things they need to buy anyway and arguably would've bought two years ago, in theory. So, you kind of asked the question, well, what do they get out of it, and I think the fundamental answer is time. Time in the near term to keep tariffs either where they are or lowered. Time to stockpile critical things like chips and so on under these temporary general licenses from the Commerce Department. And then I think time in the sort of mid- or more strategic sense of giving themselves more time to execute this transition that they're trying to execute toward greater self-sufficiency in these critical areas, especially in high tech. MICHAEL MORELL: How do you think they're thinking about how the president's going to play the trade issue between now and the election? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, I think that's a serious concern of theirs. So, one concern I hear frequently expressed from them is if we sign on to phase one and we purchase a lot of agriculture products and we make some concessions on intellectual property and so on, but that original $250 billion in tariffs stays on, what motivation do we have to get into phase two if we're not being given any sense of progress. And how do we know that it won't then just stay in place through the election? And who knows whether President Trump will still be president after that election. So, I think that's a real concern of theirs. That said, I think there's a duality to it. My sense is they also feel they should try to accomplish as much with President Trump as they can. They do have some concerns if it was a Democrat administration that they might overturn the deals that are made. But we all know that it's a lot harder to overturn something that's already been signed. So, I think they're eager to try to make as much progress as they can. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, in that same light, right, did you hear much talk about impeachment and how the Chinese think impeachment might impact them? MICHAEL MORELL: They're definitely thinking about it. I think confusion is the watchword. I mean, there's a general sense, I think, that, 'Well, he beat the Russia rap so why is this a big deal?' And to be honest, I think oftentimes the Chinese certainly ask for quid pro quos with foreign governments and so on. So, perhaps it's a little more confusing to them as to why this is a problem. I think certain their sense of our political system has improved over the years. They've spent a lot of effort trying to become smarter about it. But day to day, I think they still largely are confused by it. I think their sense is, again, he's the one we're dealing with now. We have to just sort of concentrate on that. Yes, maybe it makes him a little weaker. I think there's certainly a sense it makes him more inclined to try to achieve something with the Chinese and our behavior shows that. MICHAEL MORELL: Do you think they have a preference on what comes next? CHRIS JOHNSON: It's hard to say. But I find it very telling, for example, that Speaker Pelosi the other day made a big point on China. Really, the only thing she said of recent on China policy, in noting that, in effect, Democrats would be just as tough in terms of how we deal with these IP theft issues and so on. But we would be tougher and smarter in that we would be working with the allies, and President Trump does not. And I think there's certainly a sense in China that another four years of Trump equals another four years internationally of some chaos, I guess is the way to put it, in terms of the U.S. ability to forge coalitions with the allies that then could effectively push back. I mean, one of the key challenges that we're facing is that if there's a flaw in our strategy, whether it's Ambassador Lighthizer on the trade side or previously, John Bolton on the security side, it's that we still think we can do this unilaterally. And I have serious doubts that's the case-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right, right, right, right. I mean, I believe that withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership or not going forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a huge strategic mistake. CHRIS JOHNSON: I agree. MICHAEL MORELL: If the president were to change his mind on that, do you think that's still possible from a regional perspective? Or-- CHRIS JOHNSON: Yes, I-- MICHAEL MORELL: --has that time passed? CHRIS JOHNSON: No, I don't think the time's passed. I mean, they would always welcome the U.S. because we're a massive market. I think what's different is don't think you're going to come in and try to renegotiate it. I mean, that's really the issue. I think the notion, even from close allies, has been we're moving ahead. This thing is done and dusted, from our perspective. If you want to sign on to how it looks now, we welcome you. But don't think you're going to come in and try to make a bunch of changes. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. And then kind of the last question in the U.S./China realm. How would you describe Beijing's strategy for dealing with us, not on the trade issue or specific issues, but more broadly? What's their strategy for dealing with the United States, both in the short-term and the long-term? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah. I think in both the short-term and the long-term, but particularly the short-term, the idea is simply to get some stability in the relationship; some stability and some predictability to bind us into sort of what we had before in several previous administrations. A series of high-level dialogues that explore critical issues between the two sides. Right now, we have no strategic dialogue with China. None. And we have the trade talks, of course. But we don't have anything in terms of South China Sea issues or other issues. There's no high-level dialogue happening on the security side. And I think they view that as problematic. Some analysts would say that's because they just want to tie us up in a talk shop that never really does anything, and there's some truth in that, given how they've behaved in previous dialogues. Some others would just say, actually, no, they want that for that sense of stability. I mean, longer-term, of course, their view is that they would like to see themselves basically be the dominant power in east Asia. That's very clear. Do they have ambitions to float aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean? Probably not anytime soon. But I think what's striking is that if you look at what Xi Jinping has done, and a lot of the sort of official commentary and so on, their vision for the timeline for when they might hit this status as a great power, superpower, however you want to put it, keeps coming closer, right. So, we used to talk a lot about 2050 or even beyond that. Now, we talk about 2035, maybe even 2025. You see a lot more of that type of discussion. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, their views of us in general, right, on where we're going as a country, on where our policy is headed toward them, how do they think about that? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, I think one of the challenges we're facing with regard to how they see us is as good dialectical thinkers, right. Of course, they made an assessment actually some time ago, I would say certainly around the time of the global financial crisis (maybe even before), that-- two things, basically. One, that this conflict of some sort was inevitable. That's one point. And two, that the U.S. is in decline. And one of the things I think that has been unhelpful, as it was put to me recently by a Chinese person, was that we keep affirming their dialectical and teleological (LAUGH) thinking with what's happening here, right. So, the global financial crisis, of course, the rise of Donald Trump, the withdrawal from alliance and these sorts of things, you know, they see that all as self-affirmatory of the judgment that they've already made. And so, I think that's a very important thing to take into consideration. MICHAEL MORELL: So, this world that they grew into, right, they clearly benefited from the stability that-- CHRIS JOHNSON: Definitely. MICHAEL MORELL: --was provided by the United States. CHRIS JOHNSON: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: Do they understand that? CHRIS JOHNSON: They do. They do. MICHAEL MORELL: Who do they think is gonna provide that if not the United States? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, I think actually they're worried about that. I mean, it's another one of these dualities that they face. Thankfully, again, as Marxists, they're very comfortable with contradictions. (LAUGH) But I think their concern is we never liked the U.S. world policeman thing. That's too much, right. But we don't want to have to try to fill that role. And in fact, I don't see any ambition on their part to wanna fill that role. Why would you do so when you've done so well freeriding, effectively-- (OVERTALK) MICHAEL MORELL: And when you do that, you have to choose sides, right-- CHRIS JOHNSON: That's right, exactly. MICHAEL MORELL: --and when you choose sides, you lose one as a market. CHRIS JOHNSON: It starts getting messy, exactly. And I think that's really the issue is that if we try to play this as some kind of a new Cold War, an ideological death struggle between our two countries, I think that's going to be a big mistake because of its size, influence, economy and so on, China's just a different beast than the Soviet Union. I mean, a key example, one thing that worked well for the U.S. in the Cold War was Soviet international isolation. China's not isolated internationally. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. And you're not gonna contain them economically? CHRIS JOHNSON: Definitely not. MICHAEL MORELL: They're gonna break through those chains? CHRIS JOHNSON: Correct. MICHAEL MORELL: And I think I know the answer to this question but I want to ask it anyway. The president's decision in northern Syria, right, how would they look at that? CHRIS JOHNSON: I think it's problematic. I think they certainly would take from it perhaps here's a guy who basically doesn't like wars. I was never a fan of the notion that President Obama-- Syria red lined and emboldened the Chinese in the South China Sea. I think that's wrong. What did embolden them in the South China Sea was our failure to respond to the Scarborough Shoal situation at the time that that occurred. But they're certainly looking at it. And I think actually it's a good point because it might be one of these areas where they're actually concerned. Is the U.S. kind of pulling out of the Middle East? President Trump talks a lot about that we don't need them anymore. We have domestic energy security and so on. And how strange is it that on something like Syria, President Putin and Turkey's Erdogan are discussing the settlement? That's crazy. There's no U.S. role. So, I'm sure it's perplexing to them. And I don't think they necessarily love that idea. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. I mean, stability in the Middle East is pretty important to them? CHRIS JOHNSON: Very much so. They are now the chief customer, not us. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, Hong Kong. CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah? MICHAEL MORELL: Walk us through where we are in Hong Kong and how we got there. CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah. Well, where we are I think is a bit of a mess. The situation remains pretty unstable. I think a lot of folks didn't think perhaps that this would be as persistent as it has been. We had the Umbrella movement, obviously, in 2014 that went for a decent amount of time but then petered out. I think Beijing continues to hope that this will burn out. And there's been some evidence of that in the recent series of protests in that clearly the Chinese are embarking on an effort to separate what we might call the day-trippers, people who want to enjoy getting out for a good protest on weekends, and the hard-core, right, who are the people who are Molotov cocktail bombing MRT stations, subway stations, and the like. So, there's some sense that that is kind of working. But there's clearly no plan. As to how we got here, a lot of people blame China's increasing sort of stranglehold on the territory, or at least not necessarily living up to its commitments about Hong Kong autonomy and rule of law and this sort of thing. That's definitely true. That's a big issue. I think the bigger issue, though, actually is the greed of the Hong Kong tycoons; the property developers Hong Kong. This has caused a lot of the concern about housing prices and the lack of availability for young, middle-class people to be able to get housing and so on. That's a serious issue. And I think that has to play out domestically. And we're now seeing-- MICHAEL MORELL: So, this isn't only about the relationship with Beijing? This is about how-- CHRIS JOHNSON: No, no, a lot of these factors are Hong Kong-centric and have been going on for a long time. And definitely in the past, there were Hong Kong governments that were talking to these property barons and saying,\u00a0 Give us some land. How about we do a Singapore-style social housing experiment? Something like that?' And that just didn't happen. Now, obviously the mainland is not helping the process here. But some of these societal conflicts and tensions are unique to the place. MICHAEL MORELL: And have the protesters become more radical over time? CHRIS JOHNSON: I think so, in general. Although, it's hard to say. One thing that's very fascinating is that at least the sort of more mainstream people-- there's a fellow named Jimmy Lai, who's a Hong Kong publisher. He recently was in the U.S. and spoke to Congress. One thing they are picking up on is the violence is tough for U.S. support. You know, they heard this on the Hill. Vice-president Pence mentioned it in his recent speech. So, it's hard for us to give full throated support to the demonstrators when they're embarking on violence-- MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, yeah, so if you're in Beijing, how do you look at this? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, I think you see it as very problematic. I mean, one thing that was striking, and again, I think it speaks to Xi Jinping's pragmatism-- I certainly was of the opinion, with this going on and the October 1, 70th anniversary of the PRC, which was very important to them, approaching-- I thought, well, they're going to want to try to stop this thing. The last thing they want is a counter parade, effectively happening in Hong Kong. But they allowed it, which was very interesting. I think there's a number of reasons for that, one of which was perhaps to some degree, their paranoia. If they had moved security forces from the mainland in to take care of business, shall we say, they could've gotten stuck down there and would not have been present on the mainland for those celebrations; things like this. But they made a decision. And I think there's a general sense amongst the leadership that-- or at least it's a line I think that's used internally occasionally, which is if we were to engage in a violent crackdown, this is playing into a U.S. plot. The U.S. trap to isolate us again, like after Tiananmen, just as our rise is hitting its stride. And I think that has a lot of resiliency inside their-- MICHAEL MORELL: Is there a Taiwan connection here, too? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, certainly. I mean, there's a Taiwan connection from the point of view of-- with my Chinese Communist Party goggles on, I can basically understand most of their policy toward Hong Kong. The one area where it doesn't make sense is the demonstration effect for Taiwan. I mean, if you're President Tsai or you're the independence leaning party, the DPP, and you're looking at this, you're saying, 'That's one country, two systems, no thank you.' And in fact, I think they basically concede that the mess in Hong Kong will hand reelection to President Tsai. Obviously, something they would prefer not to see. MICHAEL MORELL: So, what would have to happen for Beijing to crack down in Hong Kong? CHRIS JOHNSON: I think we would have to see perhaps some even stronger efforts at some sort of sense of separation or that there's a real independence moving, going-- you know. I think it was interesting as well that the demonstrators several-- it was probably more than a month ago now. At one point, they had a parade where they wound up at the U.S. Consulate. They were carrying U.S. flags. They were singing the U.S. anthem; things like this. That kind of stuff obviously very much sets off that color revolution alarm in China's head. But I think we would have to see really serious domestic disorder there before they would move in. I mean, one of the challenges is what can-- there is a PLA (People's Liberation Army) garrison in Hong Kong, of course. But there aren't a ton of troops there. What can they do that 40,000 Hong Kong police can't? And I think that's another piece that's often underestimated. Hong Kong actually has many more things within their domestic emergency powers that they can use, and would use, before there would be a violent crackdown. MICHAEL MORELL: Is there knowledge in China of what's happening in Hong Kong? CHRIS JOHNSON: Certainly among the elites, there's knowledge. The average person has some sense. I would say Chinese who live right across the border in Shenzhen or Guangdong, they have a pretty good idea, probably, of what's happening down there. But if you're in Beijing or certainly you're in some far-flung western province, you probably have little idea of what's happening other than what the official media tells you is happening. MICHAEL MORELL: And if you're an average Chinese person, how would you look at this? How would you look at Hong Kong-- CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, it's quite striking. I mean, we often poo-poo China's official propaganda but it can be quite compelling. I mean, it's striking. Of recent, when I'm in China and I'm doing my usual sort of taxi driver intelligence gathering on the matter, the lines that you hear are things like spoiled children. They don't understand the beneficence of China and all the good that China has done; these sort of things. It's kinda funny, right. Vice President Pence, in his recent speech, said we rebuilt China over the last 40 years. Chinese very much rankle at that. But they don't mind talking about how much they've done for Hong Kong when, of course, Hong Kong has done a lot for the mainland's development-- MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, yeah. Chris, one last question. If you think about U.S. interests in the world, and Chinese interests in the world, where are they in conflict with each other? And where is there some consistency? Where is there some overlap? CHRIS JOHNSON: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). I think on the overlap side, we have a perennial set of issues that we've been trying to work on together for some time. North Korea's nuclear problem, obviously, there's no real solution there without Chinese help and assistance. Although, they are a very difficult partner to work with on that subject. Climate change, we're seeing the alarm bells being rung louder and louder by scientists and by international participants. There was a big feature at the U.N. General Assembly meeting this year. Other sort of non-traditional threats, I think there are areas where we can work together. In terms of areas where we're in conflict, I think a lot of it depends on, first, both sides (in my mind) need to conduct something of a more zero-based review of the other side's ambitions, globally, right, and make an assessment which of those ambitions can we accept and which ones can we not accept. And those that we can accept, you communicate that at a very high level. We can accept these things and let's try to work together on them. And those that we cannot accept, I think we have to telegraph that as well at a very high level. Probably set them out as red lines for us. And then operationalize the red lines by actually having our actions meet what we say is a red line so the other leadership can see they mean it when they say it's a red line. MICHAEL MORELL: And they get to do the same thing? CHRIS JOHNSON: Absolutely, they need to do the same thing-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right, because of their clout in the world now-- CHRIS JOHNSON: Absolutely. They need to do the same thing. And I would say they have had some efforts at that, I think, over recent years. But they could do more. And again, what this highlights is the absence of meaningful strategic dialogue. We're not having those conversations-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right. CHRIS JOHNSON: --and I think that's problematic. MICHAEL MORELL: And absent the strategic dialogue you're talking about, where are we going to be in ten years, do you think? And I know that's an unfair question but-- CHRIS JOHNSON: It's a tough question. But I think what we're seeing now looks a lot like I think what we might be seeing, unless there's some sort of a decided effort by both governments to try to say, okay, this is tilting toward conflict or downward spiral, or however you want to put it. What can we do to try to arrest that? I think if we don't do that, we're going to find ourselves in big trouble with each other because assumptions are being made, right, and there's no opportunity to be able to adjudicate that by talking to each other. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, and I just want to make a point and get your reaction to it. I think sometimes when people hear China experts say what you just said, they assume you want to give in to China, right. That they get a voice and we're going to talk to them about what's important to us and they get to talk about what's important to them-- CHRIS JOHNSON: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: --and that's not what you're saying at all? CHRIS JOHNSON: No, not at all. In fact, I think it's the opposite. I mean, having a meaningful dialogue can be done from strength. And my own sense, in fact, is that giving into them in a way would be doing nothing like we're doing now, because in effect, we're ceding the field to their narrative, which is increasingly powerful. MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, thanks very much for joining us. CHRIS JOHNSON: My pleasure, Michael. Thank you. * * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

The two-term female senator and former congresswoman from a purple New York district lasted five months in the 2020 Democratic primary, notes\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who positioned herself as a champion of reproductive rights and working families, ended her campaign for president today. She struggled to break through in polling or on the debate stage \u2014 even as some of her signature platforms found the spotlight this summer \u2014 including her 9/11 First Responders bill and advocacy for abortion rights. She is the first of seven senators running in the Democratic field to drop out. Gillibrand has said she'll endorse, and she has warm relationships with Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, in particular. Will her eventual endorsement carry any weight? Or does Gillibrand, a Clinton-anointed public servant who campaigned on winning over red, purple, and blue areas, represent the kind of moderate Democrat that voters are glad to see clearing the path for others?

KAMALA HARRIS CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0reports Harris' team is launching a new digital ad highlighting her recent five-day bus tour across Iowa. (Read Adam's story here)\u00a0 The spot features clips of Harris speaking to crowds at campaign stops across the state highlighting issues like teacher pay and her conversations with Iowans at the Iowa State Fair, a Baptist church, a farm and a mobile home community.\u00a0 \"This campaign is about all of us. It is so much bigger than me. I cannot do this without you,\" Harris says at the conclusion of the ad, which will run on Facebook and YouTube. The Harris campaign says this is part of a six-figure digital and television advertising blitz in Iowa. Data from the media firm Advertising Analytics show Harris' campaign has spent and booked about $450,000 on broadcast and cable television advertising in Iowa from August 8 through the week of September 3. Also on Wednesday, Harris slammed President Trump for comments he tweeted about Puerto Rico. The island is bracing for landfall of Hurricane Dorian as its residents are still fighting to recover from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria in 2017.\u00a0 \"I don't know, it's just something missing. He lacks the ability to have empathy, or sympathy, or concern...And this president is lacking in the ability to lead,\" said Harris at a Wednesday Nevada union event.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0says the senator referred to Mr. Trump as a \"lawless president\" and alluded to a\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0report asserting the president told officials he'd pardon them if they have to break laws to get 500 miles of his long-sought border wall built by Election Day. JOE BIDEN A wealthy private citizen named Shirley Shawe has purchased $500,000 in ad time in early-voting states to slam Joe Biden over a business dispute that negatively affected her son's company years ago, CBS News campaign reporters Bo Erickson and Zak Hudak report. The ad, which has little to do with 2020 issues, instead focuses on a bit of business arcana, the\u00a0Delaware Chancery Court system, which was formed to adjudicate business disputes involving Delaware-based corporations. \u00a0 \"The Delaware court is too male, too white and anything but open,\" the ad's narrator says of court system.\u00a0 The\u00a0ad, shown here, bashes the Chancery Court and ties Biden to them, highlighting snippets of a 14-minute exchange in\u00a0a 2005 Senate hearing\u00a0 between then-Senator Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, who was a Harvard law professor at the time. Shawe's ad accuses Biden of corruptly defending the system as Warren attacks it. Here's Bo's and Zak's story. MAKING IT OFFICIAL After three weeks of campaigning and $1.9 million spent on advertisement and operations, Tate Reeves is now officially Mississippi's Republican nominee for governor. The lieutenant governor won in Tuesday's Republican runoff with 54.3 percent of the vote against former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Waller Jr.\u00a0 Reeves will face Democratic candidate Jim Hood \u2013 the state's attorney general \u2013 on November 5. In a poll released by Hood's campaign and conducted by Democratic pollster firm Hickman Analytics Inc., Hood leads by 1 to 3 points over Reeves among likely voters.\u00a0 The poll also said 75 percent of the 600 likely voters surveyed support expanding Medicaid, which was one of the issues at the forefront of Waller's campaign. Hood has made health care a central part of his campaign and on Wednesday, he toured medical facilities in Jackson, Mississippi, a city where three of the four neighboring state counties voted for Waller.\u00a0 A Republican strategist familiar with the race told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that while the state's hospital associations usually support Democrats, \"the Republicans Waller got will stick\" to voting red in November, regardless of Hood's focus on health care. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "SEN. KAMALA HARRIS:\u00a0Just in time for the second round of the 2020 Democratic debates, on Monday Sen. Kamala Harris\u00a0released\u00a0her version of a \"Medicare for All\" plan. While the campaign says she is still a co-sponsor of Sen. Bernie Sanders' bill, Harris' proposal has some key differences, including expanding the transition period from four years (as proposed by Sanders) to ten years, calling on private insurance to offer Medicare plans and allowing families of four making less than $100,000 and those within designated \"high-cost\" areas to be exempt from a middle class tax hike.\u00a0 The California senator also visited two minority-owned businesses on northwest Detroit's \"Avenue of Fashion\" on Monday morning. While there, she responded to former Vice President Joe Biden recently saying he would not be as polite \u2013 a comment directed at Harris following their first debate interaction.\u00a0 \"My mother raised me to be polite and I intend to be polite,\" said Harris. \"I will express differences and articulate them and certainly point out where we have differences in opinion because I believe that democrats and the American voter have a right to know that. But there's no reason we can't be polite.\"\u00a0 When asked what advice she may have for Sen. Cory Booker on night two, Harris told\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0that \"Cory Booker is brilliant and he knows what to do. I don't need to tell him what to do.\" Harris added that she would \"tell him to be himself. That's it.\"\u00a0 Harris started off speaking to the press with a statement expressing her sorrow to families whose loved ones were killed and injured in Gilroy, California over the weekend.\u00a0 The Harris campaign also tells CBS News they have over 450 volunteer-organized watch parties in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. for the second Democratic debates. This is more than double the number from the first Democratic debates, according to a Harris campaign spokesperson.\u00a0 REP. TIM RYAN:\u00a0Over the weekend,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0asked Rep. Tim Ryan how he's preparing for the debates during his visit to Greenville, South Carolina. He said that voters can expect a familiar message from the last debate.\u00a0 \"You're going to hear the same thing\u2014talking about getting wages up, and rebuilding the middle class, and really getting away from this left right divide that we have in the country right now,\" said Ryan. \"It's got to be about new ideas, new politics, new ways of solving these old problems and that's what I'm going to be providing, that's what I've been talking about, we're going to continue talking about that during the debates.\"\u00a0 The Ohio congressman also mentioned that because the Detroit debates are in his \"neck of the woods,\" he plans to drive to them.\u00a0 DOWN SOUTH:\u00a0After defending President Trump's\u00a0criticism\u00a0of Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings and his majority-black Maryland district on CBS News'Face the Nation, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is receiving backlash from the Democratic Party in the state he once represented as a member of Congress. South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Trav Robertson says it's laughable for Mulvaney to criticize any district after failing to eliminate the poverty gap in certain counties within the state.\u00a0 \"Mick Mulvaney flat out lied about the problems people face in SC-5 while defending the racist rants that are used to energize Trump's base,\" said Robertson. \"Representative Cummings has done more to advance the ideals that make America a land of opportunity than Trump and Mulvaney have the mental acuity to imagine.\"\u00a0 Before being selected by the president to join his administration, Mulvaney served as the Republican U.S. Representative for South Carolina's 5th Congressional District.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0spoke with a couple voters who were familiar with the president's tweets, and one independent voter, who didn't want to give their name, said the tweets were \"reprehensible\" and that the president should consider \"keeping his mouth shut\" sometimes. ON THE $$$:\u00a0The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA announced Monday that it raised $23.4 million through the end of June. The cash haul is part of $88 million in commitments obtained by the independent Democratic committee. This is the most money raised by Priorities in the first half of an off-year in its history, says\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. At this stage of the 2016 election cycle, Priorities had raised $15.7 million.\u00a0 \"We are thrilled with the level of support we have received at this early stage of the 2020 cycle,\" said Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil. The fundraising announcement comes after Priorities USA launched a $100 million spending program in 2019 and early 2020 beginning in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that included a six-figure digital ad campaign last month ahead of Mr. Trump's re-election kickoff rally.\u00a0 TO YOUR HEALTH:\u00a0Texas Sen. John Cornyn accused Democrats on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0Monday of not joining Republicans in the fight to guarantee coverage of pre-existing conditions even though Cornyn is one of the senators who voted to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act in 2017.\u00a0 A spokesperson for Cornyn told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ellee Watson\u00a0that Cornyn's tweet referred to Democrats refusing to jump on the\u00a0Protect Act\u00a0that Cornyn co-sponsored in April, which is designed to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. The nonpartisan\u00a0Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\u00a0found that the bill falls short of its stated goal by allowing insurers to exclude coverage of essential health benefits like mental health care, sell plans with no limit on out-of-pocket costs, and charge older people far more than young people.\u00a0 Cornyn's vote to repeal the ACA is featured in a\u00a0video released\u00a0by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to mark the two-year anniversary of the votes. The Senate failed to repeal parts of the ACA in July 2017 in a 49-51 vote with three Republicans voting not to repeal.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE: CBS News Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports within the past seven days, four Republican U.S. Representatives have announced they would not seek re-election in 2020. Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah was the latest to do so when announced Monday he would not seek a ninth term.\u00a0 In 2012, Bishop promised to voters he'd retire after serving out a House committee leadership position, and his role as chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources expires in 2020. According to CBS News' latest count so far this year, Bishop joins six other Republican House members and one Democrat who have announced they would not run for re-election.\u00a0 In the east, New Jersey House Democrat Rep. Josh Gottheimer is facing a new progressive primary challenger. Arati Kreibich, a city councilwoman in the district, campaigned for Gottheimer's re-election in 2018 but later\u00a0criticized\u00a0his role in passing the Senate's iteration of the border security bill through the house.\u00a0 Kreibich's announcement video highlights her immigrant background and how Mr. Trump's election motivated her to run for public office. \"And now I'm running again because incremental change isn't cutting it,\" she said in the video. Republicans have targeted Gottheimer's seat in 2020, and GOP House campaign arm spokesman Michael McAdams pointed to the district going for Trump in 2016. \"The last thing Josh Gottheimer needs is a primary challenger who will push him even further to the left,\" he said. However, Gottheimer has shown his fundraising chops, recording close to a million dollars in the second quarter of the year alone.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Several of the Democratic presidential candidates have responded to President Trump's \"Salute to America\" celebration on the National Mall on July 4: Bill de Blasio: De Blasio told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0in an interview in Iowa this afternoon that he \"love[s] this country and I love celebrating our history. But I would never spend millions and millions of dollars on a military display that's just about Donald Trump's ego ...\u00a0 We don't need tanks going down the avenues of Washington, we need money given to our veterans and their health care and their mental health care. The things we could do to put them back on their feet.\" Julian Castro:\u00a0Castro told\u00a0\"CBS This Morning\" co-anchor Gayle King\u00a0in an interview Wednesday morning that \"instead of addressing something like veteran homelessness, [Mr. Trump] is spending it on boosting his ego with a parade that's fundamentally about him and then getting tickets into the hands of wealthy donors for the Republican Party. What a waste of money.\" Beto O'Rourke:\u00a0In a gaggle with\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0in Iowa, O'Rourke said, \"I don't know that these kind of displays are necessary. They're certainly very expensive. I would much rather us honor our veterans, those who serve this country, those who are currently deployed and serving in uniform. I think that's a much better way to celebrate our armed forces than the military equipment and the tanks and the jet planes and all that stuff. So yeah, it's unfortunate, but that's what we've come to expect from this president.\" Pete Buttigieg:\u00a0In an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Buttigieg said, \"The Fourth of July is supposed to be about our country, not about any one person. Not about politics. Definitely not about the ego of the president. The people who got our country started in the revolution were skeptical of the presidency getting to look too much lime an imperial or royal office, and I'm afraid that's the direction this president is taking it.\" Kamala Harris:\u00a0In a gaggle with CNN\u00a0tweeted\u00a0by Kyung Lah, Harris said, \"What I'd ask is he thinks about a military parade \u2014 why don't you think about military families? And think about the fact that military parents, that you're sending their sons and daughters to what might be war and what are your thoughts and reflections about that? What are your thoughts and priorities around supporting members of our military and veterans? That's how I think about that issue.\" Bernie Sanders:\u00a0Sanders\u00a0tweeted: \"This is what authoritarians do: @realDonaldTrump is taking $2.5 million away from our National Park Service to glorify himself with a spectacle of military tanks rolling through Washington. And top GOP donors are getting VIP seats, all at taxpayer expense.\" Marianne Williamson:\u00a0In a\u00a0tweet, Williamson said: \"Here is the\u00a0livestream link\u00a0for my July 4 talk. 2pm Pacific, 5pm Eastern. There will be no army tanks; only a celebration of the Declaration of Independence and a deep discussion about how to make it more real for our time.\" Michael Bennet:\u00a0Bennet criticized Mr. Trump in a\u00a0tweet: \"President Trump is turning the 4th of July into a political spectacle \u2013 at the expense of taxpayers and our National Parks.\" And Mr. Trump's sole primary challenger\u00a0Bill Weld\u00a0weighed in as well: Weld\u00a0tweeted: \"With the President draining the budget of the National Park Service to fund his own July 4 military-style extravaganza on the Mall, we are reaching the \"bread and circuses\" stage of tyrants seizing total power in a democracy.At least Julius Caesar paid for his own triumphs!:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 SEN. KAMALA HARRIS:\u00a0Harris began her day with a seventh endorsement from the Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 this one from Connecticut Rep. Jahana Hayes, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Stephanie Ramirez. Hayes made history in her state as the first black woman to represent Connecticut in Congress. The Harris campaign also says Hayes is the first federally elected Connecticut official to endorse in the Democratic presidential primary. Harris referred to Mr. Trump as a predator in a speech in West Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday. \"We have a predator living in the White House,\" she told voters. As of 5 p.m., Harris had not yet released her second quarter fundraising numbers.\u00a0Ramirez\u00a0was told by the campaign it will happen \"later this week.\" DOWN SOUTH:\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren received endorsements from two South Carolina State Representatives today, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell. In an\u00a0op-ed in The State, Richland County Reps. Wendy C. Brawley and Kambrell Garvin said they believe the only way to open doors of opportunity for all South Carolinians is to make big, structural changes in the state's economy. They think Warren is the person who can get this job done. In statements provided by the representatives, they cited Warren's policy proposals, fight for the working class and vow to tackle growing student debt as reasons for\u00a0throwing their support behind her. \"[Warren] understands the problems millions of Americans face every day trying to keep a roof over their head and food on the family table,\" said Brawley. \"She has well-thought out plans that actually solve problems \u2026 her solutions are practical and don't put greater burdens on working families, and most important, she offers a realistic way to pay for each plan she proposes.\" Garvin added that Warren's education policy proposals will help improve the lives of children and families. \"As a former community organizer and public school teacher, law graduate, state legislator and life-long advocate for South Carolina's public schools, I believe that education is key to lifting children out of poverty and providing them the tools for success,\" said Garvin. \"I chose to support Elizabeth Warren because of her ambitious policy proposals and sincere desire to make the American Dream obtainable for all families.\" According to the campaign, this is Warren's third endorsement in the state. SOUTH CAROLINA FUNDRAISING:\u00a0As 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls reveal second quarter fundraising hauls, Democratic Senate challenger Jaime Harrison's campaign announced that his team has raised more than $1.5 million in the first fundraising quarter since launching in May, according to\u00a0Mitchell. Harrison is challenging longtime Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham for his seat in the Senate. Harrison's campaign says that it has brought in $1.3 million in the 33 days since officially launching and that this fundraising haul is the most ever raised by a Democratic Senate challenger in South Carolina political history. \"I am inspired and humbled by the overwhelming support,\" said Jaime Harrison in a statement. \"Together, we're going to win this campaign to elect a United States Senator with the courage to lower health care costs and defend our rural hospitals, protect our coasts, and create opportunity for all South Carolinians.\" According to the campaign, Harrison has received 60,224 total contributions with an average contribution of $26. Harrison's campaign manager Zack Carroll says their team is building a campaign on an outpouring of support from grassroots donors and volunteers. \"This campaign is focused on empowering regular South Carolinians to hold Lindsey Graham accountable for his record of always putting his political future ahead of what's best for South Carolina.\" #CLOSETHECAMPS PROTESTS:\u00a0Protestors gathered in front of Sen. Lindsey Graham's Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, office yesterday to protest conditions that have been reported at migrant detention facilities on the border. \"Senator Graham believes the petitions for asylum should be filed in the migrants home country \u2014 generally Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala \u2014 or in Mexico,\" a spokesperson for Graham told\u00a0Mitchell. \"He believes this will help prevent migrants from risking their lives on a dangerous 1,000 mile journey to the United States.\"\u00a0 The Charleston-based \"Close the Camps\" protest was one of multiple demonstrations nationwide that took place yesterday. Local news outlets report that protesters demanded for Graham to close the camps and refuse authorized funding for deportations. DOCTOR WHO:\u00a0In less than a week, voters will choose between two doctors, Dr. Joan Perry and Dr. Greg Murphy, to be their Republican candidate for North Carolina's 3rd Congressional District, which has been consistently red since Rep. Walter B. Jones Jr.'s election in 1994. His death in February resulted in a special election and, since none of the 17 GOP candidates got more than 30% of the vote in the initial May primaries, a runoff was called between the two top vote getters in Perry and Murphy. With a comfortable red path to the House either way, the race between the two candidates has turned into the GOP's real first test to get a woman, Perry, past the primaries \u2014 something that was rare in 2018. The National Republican Congressional Committee has made getting more women past the primaries a priority and has contacted over 170 female candidates nationwide so far, reports\u00a0CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0 All 13 Republican women in the House, including Republican Conference Chair Rep. Liz Cheney, have endorsed Perry. Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin and Joe Anne Jones, the wife of the late congressman, are also other notable endorsements. Perry's pro-life stance, a foundational part of her campaign, has resulted in a bit over $1 million in campaign support from the Women for Women Action Fund and the Women Speak Out Political Action Committee, according to the Federal Election Committee. Murphy has relied more so on support from Meadows' House Freedom Fund PAC, which spent $186,000 in opposition efforts against Perry. As of Wednesday afternoon, about 9,500 early votes have been recorded so far according to North Carolina State Election Board officials, about 70 percent of the voter turnout from the May primaries. The general election will be held on Tuesday, July 9. SENATE BATTLEGROUNDS:\u00a0In addition to Harrison, Democratic Senate candidates in battleground states across the country have posted impressive fundraising numbers for the second financial quarter, reports\u00a0CBS News associate producer Ellee Watson. \u00a0 Mark Kelly in Arizona, who is facing Sen. Martha McSally, raised $4.2 million. In the first week of her campaign, Sara Gideon raised $1 million in Maine where she hopes to run against Republican Sen. Susan Collins in the general election. Gideon faces a Democratic primary with Betsy Sweet. In New Mexico, Ben Ray Lujan raised $1.1 million, and two candidates in Colorado raised over $1 million.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg are dealing with complicated matters of race ahead of the most important campaign weekend so far this cycle in South Carolina, an early primary state with the largest bloc of black voters in the early weeks of the 2020 primary calendar. Both are set to appear at Rep. Jim Clyburn's \"World Famous Fish Fry\" and meet with voters of color at other events. But incidents in the last few days could complicate those appearances. On Tuesday night, Biden\u00a0highlighted\u00a0his past work relationship with the late senators Herman Talmadge of Georgia and James Eastland of Mississippi, two noted segregationists, during a New York City fundraiser.\u00a0 The\u00a0Democratic front-runner\u00a0referenced Eastland while arguing for more civility in Washington. \"I know the new, new left tells me that I'm \u2014 this is old-fashioned,\" Biden said, according to the pool report. \"Well guess what? If we can't reach a consensus in our system, what happens? It encourages and demands the abuse of power by a president. That's what it does. You have to be able to reach consensus under our system \u2014 our constitutional system of separation of powers.\" Biden has made this point before \u2014 that despite differences with Republicans and some members of his own party over issues as profound as civil rights, he still found ways to work with them in a cooperative or bipartisan fashion.\u00a0 But several of his 2020 Democratic primary competitors jumped on his remarks on Wednesday, including New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Rep. John Delaney and Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Booker said Biden's \"relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone.\" He added later, \"I'm disappointed that he hasn't issued an immediate apology for the pain his words are dredging up for many Americans. He should.\"\u00a0 Harris said the former vice president's statement \"concerns me deeply. If those men had their way I would not be in the United States Senate and on this elevator right now.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0reports that Buttigieg held a press conference with community leaders in Indiana on Wednesday to discuss the aftermath of a shooting of a black man by a white police officer in South Bend on Sunday.\u00a0 Buttigieg said the city is aiming for justice and transparency in the ongoing investigation. Moving forward, Buttigieg said the city wants fairness and equality. Buttigieg acknowledged, \"We can do that working together. It won't be easy. It's not supposed to be easy, but we can do something here that will make a tremendous difference.\" Over the past several days, Buttigieg has been speaking with leaders in the faith community, elected officials, local activists and other community leaders, according to the mayor's office. Buttigieg sat down with CBS affiliate WSBT-TV and was asked to comment on if the relationship between the police department and the African American community is \"beyond repair.\" Buttigieg responded. \"We just can't accept that. We live in the same community. The police department and the African American community are part of the same family.\" SEN. CORY BOOKER:\u00a0Booker appeared before a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Wednesday that discussed a bill that would create a commission to study proposals for reparations to the descendants of slaves. In his testimony,\u00a0Turman\u00a0says Booker noted the urgency of this moment and said, \"This bill, which I am now leading on the Senate side, is the beginning on an important process not just to examine and study this history that has not been addressed, the silence that persists, but also to find practical ideas to address the enduring justices in our nation.\"\u00a0 SEC. JULIAN CASTRO: The former HUD secretary released the third and final part of his \"People First Housing Plan\" on Wednesday, per\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. Part three focuses on increasing homeownership by establishing a National Housing Stabilization Fund for people experiencing housing insecurity and means to make credit more accessible. The plan also calls for holding Wall Street more accountable through various measures, including strengthening and rebuilding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. UP NORTH:\u00a0Amidst an expanding ground game effort in the Granite State, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's\u00a0New Hampshire team will open four field offices in Portsmouth, Nashua, Keene, and Manchester this week, says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0 \"Opening field offices will help us to build upon the organizing we've been doing for months in communities all across the state,\" New Hampshire state director Liz Wester said in a statement to CBS News. \"Whether we are hosting policy discussions, coffee hours, or going door-to-door \u2014 we're excited to expand our grassroots organization here in New Hampshire and bring more Granite Staters into this fight with us.\" DOWN SOUTH:\u00a0The South Carolina Democratic primary is months away, but that won't stop the flow of at least 22 presidential hopefuls from packing into the Palmetto State this weekend.\u00a0CBSN political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns,\u00a0CBS News campaign associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0talked to the state's Democratic Party chairman, Trave Robertson, who gave them a preview of what to expect. \u00a0 \"This is \u2014 what we would, could consider in South Carolina \u2014 the first real introduction of the presidential candidates to the core constituency of the Democratic Party,\" says Robertson. \"The individuals who take time to go to their precinct meetings, go to their county conventions, and then go to their state conventions ... [it will be the people] who consider themselves the activists of the Democratic Party.\"\u00a0 OUT WEST:\u00a0In interviews published by The New York Times today,\u00a0nearly every candidate\u00a0declared their unequivocal opposition to the death penalty, in step with a party that has turned against the\u00a0once widely-accepted sentence. At first glance this might appear to be a boon for candidates in California, where the governor was applauded this year for his\u00a0moratorium on all executions. But\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports that\u00a0polling this week\u00a0in the Golden State suggests a narrow majority of California Democrats still support capital punishment for serious crimes.\u00a0 Across the border, Nevada's governor has walked back his own opposition to the death penalty,\u00a0conceding that\u00a0some cases (like that of mass shooter Stephen Paddock) could warrant the sentence. And this year,\u00a0an attempt\u00a0in the Nevada legislature to eliminate the death penalty flopped. #WCW:\u00a0The Winning for Women (WFW) Action Fund on Wednesday launched its 20 in 20 initiative, focused on electing 20 Republican women to the House in 2020. WFW is hosting a launch party Wednesday night in Washington, where GOP leaders like Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Rep. Liz Cheney, Rep. Elise Stefanik and Rep. Susan Brooks are slated to speak.\u00a0 WFW communications director Olivia Perez-Cubas told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson\u00a0that she expects more than 100 people at the event, including other female members of the House as well as GOP operatives and staff. \u00a0 The WFW Action Fund was created following the 2018 midterms when Rep. Carol Miller was the only non-incumbent Republican woman to win an election to the House. The total number of GOP women in the House is 13, significantly lower than the Democrats' 89. North Carolina's 3rd Congressional District is the first race the group is participating in and will serve as a test case for 2020 races. The group has already spent $500,000 to support Dr. Joan Perry, who faces Dr. Greg Murphy in the district's Republican primary on July 9. Early voting for that race started on Wednesday.",

            "article_content": "Buenos Aires, Argentina  \u2014 As lights turned back on across Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay after a massive blackout that hit tens of millions of people, authorities were still largely in the dark about what caused the collapse of the interconnected grid and were tallying the damage from the unforeseen disaster.  Argentine President Mauricio Macri promised a thorough investigation into what he called an \"unprecedented\" outage, one that raised questions about flaws in South America's grid, which connects many of the region's largest countries.  Energy officials said the results of the investigation would be available in 10 to 15 days, and they could not immediately provide details on the economic impact of the outage, which came on a Sunday, and a day before a national holiday in Argentina.  Argentine Energy Secretary Gustavo Lopetegui said the blackout began with a failure in the country's \"interconnection system,\" adding that it happens in other countries as well. But he said a chain of events took place later, causing a total disruption.  \"This is an extraordinary event that should have never happened,\" he told a news conference. \"It's very serious. We can't leave the whole country all of a sudden without electricity.\" He did not discount the possibility of a cyberattack, but said it was unlikely.  The collapse began at about 7 a.m. Sunday, with Argentina's population of 44 million and residents of neighboring Uruguay and some areas of Paraguay waking up to Father's Day in the dark.  Public transportation halted in Buenos Aires, while phone and internet communications were disrupted, water supplies were cut off and shops were forced to close. Patients dependent on home medical equipment were urged to go to hospitals with generators.  Power was fully restored by Sunday night. But the outage ignited questions about Argentina's preparedness and lack of investment in the power system at a time when the country is going through a deep economic crisis with soaring inflation, a tumbling of the local currency and a spike in utility bills fueled by austerity measures ordered by Macri.  The conservative leader has seen his popularity ratings plunge during a crisis in which he has struggled to tame one of the world's highest inflation rates and poverty has reached about a third of the population. Argentines are also frustrated with high utility costs and the blackout could trigger more protests against Macri's government just as he seeks re-election in October.  \"The country is already in a weird moment and then you wake up and can't see anything,\" said Julieta Dodda, 27, a saleswoman at a clothing store in downtown Buenos Aires. \"Many people were going to meet for lunch to celebrate the day. I saw many online who joked: \" 'Happy Father's Day from Edesur and Edenor,' which are our electricity companies.\"  Energy officials defended the strength of the Argentine system, saying it is \"robust\" and exceeding in supplies. But the grid has been known for being in a state of disrepair, with substations and cables that were insufficiently upgraded as power rates remained largely frozen for years.  An Argentine independent energy expert said that systemic operational and design errors played a role in the power grid's collapse.  \"A localized failure like the one that occurred should be isolated by the same system,\" said Ra\u00fal Bertero, president of the Center for the Study of Energy Regulatory Activity in Argentina. \"The problem is known and technology and studies (exist) to avoid it.\"  The blackout raised questions about flaws in the region's grid. Although Brazil was spared this time, a similar outage in the region's largest country left more than 60 million in the dark in 2009, just as authorities scrambled to boost confidence in its infrastructure before soccer's 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.  The power failure on Sunday comes three months after crisis-torn Venezuela suffered its worst power outage with the lack of electricity endangering hospital patients.  Other parts of the world have also been hit by major outages. Bertero said that about 50 million people were affected by a blackout in the U.S. and some provinces in Canada in 2003, and about as many were hit by another in Italy that same year.  Argentina has had a history of blackouts, but none like Sunday's failure, in which the power outage was more geographically widespread. Only the southern archipelago of Tierra del Fuego was unaffected because it is not connected to the main power grid.  \"It's something that had never happened,\" said Alejandra Mart\u00ednez, a spokesperson for the Argentine electricity company Edesur. The failure originated at an electricity transmission point between the power stations at the country's Yacyret\u00e1 dam and Salto Grande in the country's northeast.  Uruguay's energy company UTE said the failure in the Argentine system also cut power to all of Uruguay for hours and blamed the collapse on a \"flaw in the Argentine network.\"  In Paraguay, power in rural communities in the south, near the border with Argentina and Uruguay, was also cut. The country's National Energy Administration said service was restored by afternoon by redirecting energy from the Itaipu hydroelectric plant the country shares with neighboring Brazil.  Many residents of Argentina and Uruguay took to social media to post pictures of their cities in the dark. Others blamed the electricity companies or the government or simply lamented that their plans had been disrupted.  Several Argentine provinces had elections for governor on Sunday, which proceeded with voters using their phone screens and built-in flashlights to illuminate their ballots.  \"I don't remember anything like this in Uruguay,\" said Valentina Gim\u00e9nez, a resident of the capital, Montevideo. \"What is really striking about this is that no one understands well what really happened.\" ",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 While candidates were focused on campaigning in 2016, Russians were carrying out a devastating cyber-operation that changed the landscape of American politics, with aftershocks continuing well into Donald Trump's presidency. And it all started with the click of a tempting email and a typed-in password. Whether presidential campaigns have learned from the cyberattacks is a critical question ahead as the 2020 election approaches. Preventing the attacks won't be easy or cheap. \"If you are the Pentagon or the NSA, you have the most skilled adversaries in the world trying to get in but you also have some of the most skilled people working defense,\" said Robby Mook, who ran Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016. \"Campaigns are facing similar adversaries, and they don't have similar resources and virtually no expertise.\" Traditionally, cybersecurity has been a lower priority for candidates, especially at the early stages of a campaign. They need to raise money, hire staff, pay office rents, lobby for endorsements and travel repeatedly to early voting states. Particularly during primary season, campaign managers face difficult spending decisions: Air a TV ad targeting a key voting demographic or invest in a more robust security system for computer networks? \"You shouldn't have to choose between getting your message out to voters and keeping the Chinese from reading your emails,\" said Mook, now a senior fellow with the Defending Digital Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center. Mook has been helping develop a plan for a nonprofit to provide cybersecurity support and resources directly to campaigns. The Department of Homeland Security's cyber agency is offering help, and there are signs that some Democratic campaigns are willing to take the uncomfortable step of working with an administration they are trying to unseat. DHS has had about a dozen initial discussions with campaigns so far, officials said. Its focus has been on establishing trust so DHS can share intelligence about possible threats and receive information from the campaigns in return, said Matt Masterson, a senior DHS cybersecurity adviser. The department also will test a campaign's or party's networks for vulnerabilities to cyberattack. \"The challenge for a campaign is they really are a pop-up,\" Masterson said. \"They have people coming in and coming out, and they have to manage access.\" It's unclear how much campaigns are spending on cybersecurity. From January to March, 12 Democratic campaigns and Trump spent at least $960,000 total on technology-related items, but that also includes technology not related to security, such as database or website services. Former congressman John Delaney,\u00a0the first Democrat to declare his candidacy for president\u00a0, said he viewed cybersecurity as a fixed expense. \"It's not supercomputers cracking through your firewalls,\" he said. \"It's really tempting emails that people respond to and give away information.\" Candidates can get some advice from the Republican and Democratic national committees, which are in regular contact with Homeland Security and focus on implementing basic security protocols. Republican National Committee press secretary Blair Ellis said the group also works with state Republican parties and emphasizes training. The organization is also developing an internal platform to share real-time threat information with state parties. \"Data security remains a top priority for the RNC,\" she said. The DNC last year hired Bob Lord, formerly head of Yahoo's information security. He has created a checklist that focuses on basics: password security, web encryption and social media privacy. This is a bigger priority than talking about the latest network protection gadget. \"What's new and interesting is fine, but it's really just about being incredibly single-minded about the basics,\" Lord said. \"It's not glamorous, but neither is the advice for staying fit.\" The 2016 attacks were low-tech, with Russian agents sending hundreds of spearfishing emails to the personal and work emails of Clinton campaign staffers and volunteers, along with people working for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee. After an employee clicked and gave up password information, the Russians gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's networks and eventually exploited that to gain entry to the Democratic National Committee. Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, fell for the same trick on his personal email account, which allowed Russians to steal thousands of messages about the inner workings of the campaign. But it wasn't as if the Clinton campaign ignored cybersecurity. Mook said training was extensive on cyber threats, two-factor authentication was mandatory, and multiple fake emails were sent to test staffers' ability to detect phishing attempts. The relative ease with which Russian agents penetrated computers underscores the perilous situation facing campaigns. Clinton has been talking about this with Democratic presidential candidates. \"Unless we know how to protect our election from what happened before and what could happen again ... you could lose,\" Clinton said in a MSNBC interview. \"I don't mean it to scare everybody. But I do want every candidate to understand this remains a threat.\" California Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign said it also was preaching the basics of cybersecurity with staff, such as requiring two-factor authentication and using encrypted messaging. \"All staff is being trained on threats and ways to avoid being a target,\" Harris spokesman Ian Sams said. Others running in the Democratic primary avoided discussing the topic. Some campaigns, including those for Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders, would not comment. The campaigns of Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Trump's re-election campaign wouldn't talk either. The president has often downplayed Russia's interference in 2016. And his staff told former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen not to bring up election security during her meetings with him \u2014 saying she should focus on border security, his signature issue, according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Administration officials insist election security is a priority. \"We're all in in protecting 2020,\" Chris Krebs, head of DHS' cyber efforts, told lawmakers Tuesday at a House committee hearing-. \"I'd ask, each of you: Do you know if your campaign is working with us?\" ___ Cassidy reported from Atlanta. Associated Press writers Chad Day, Zeke Miller, Juana Summers and Will Weissert in Washington, Meg Kinnard in Manning, South Carolina, and Sara Burnett in Chicago contributed to this report.",

I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION.  President Trump headed to his winter White House Friday morning just hours before Washington's biggest guessing game officially ended.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have no idea about the Mueller report. I'm going to Florida.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The President has long believed he'll be exonerated.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. Everybody knows it. It's all a big hoax. It's-- I call it the witch hunt. It's all a big hoax.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Now that the report is done, speculation about what's in it grows. It's up to Attorney General William Barr to determine what to tell Congress and the public. Democrats along with a lot of Republicans are insisting the report be released.  KAMALA HARRIS: The American people have a right and a need to know.  BERNIE SANDERS: Make that full report public.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll hear from two powerful players in what could be a blistering political and legal battle, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Congressman Jim Jordan, a Trump ally who sits on two key committees investigating the President. As for Mister Trump, he is enjoying an uncharacteristically low-profile weekend, including golfing with musician Kid Rock. And it's official ISIS has finally been defeated in Iraq and Syria.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Here's ISIS on Election Day. Here's ISIS right now.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But are they fully eradicated? We'll talk with retired Marine Corps General John Allen, former envoy to counter ISIS. Plus, a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges faced by reporters covering the end of ISIS from our own CBS team in Syria.  All of that, plus, plenty of political analysis is just ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning. And welcome to FACE THE NATION. Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has ended, but its conclusions are still a mystery. Not even the White House has been briefed yet. Later today Attorney General William Barr is expected to release his summary of the report's conclusions and we'll share it with key members of Congress. That summary will be released to the public but the detailed report remains confidential at this point. What we do know, is that Mueller's twenty-two-month investigation has led to charges against thirty-four mostly Russian foreign nationals. Six are former Trump aides or confidants and so far five have been convicted. We begin in Los Angeles, with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff. Welcome to FACE THE NATION.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D-California/@RepAdamSchiff/Intelligence Committee Chairman): Good morning.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, no member of the Trump campaign was indicted for conspiring with Russia. I want to play for you what you had predicted.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (August 5, 2018): I think there's plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight. Now that's a different statement than saying that there's proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a criminal conspiracy. Bob Mueller will have to determine that.  (March 12, 2019): On the issue of collusion the-- the reality is that there is ample evidence of collusion in plain sight and it has been for a very long time.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mueller does not think there is a criminal conspiracy on this front. Does it hurt your case?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: No. As I said I have great confidence in Bob Mueller's judgment as to who should be prosecuted or who should not. We're going to have to wait to see the report and that report needs to be made public ASAP so we can evaluate the body of evidence on the issue of conspiracy and look at why Bob Mueller decided not to indict. Now vis-\u00e0-vis the President, Bob Mueller can't indict the President. So the fact that no future indictments either on conspiracy or obstruction of justice doesn't tell us about the quantum of evidence. So I think we need to wait to see the report. But I also think the AG needs to make that report publicly available. The special counsel spent two years almost investigating this. The public has a right to know and a need to know so that we don't have to ask questions about what the evidence was on either of these core subjects of his investigation.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But as we heard you say there even before the report was turned in, you did think that the President had committed a crime and, specifically, that issue of conspiracy. So is there anything that the attorney general can say that would dissuade you from that?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I never said that I thought the President had committed the crime of conspiracy. I did say that there is ample evidence, and, indeed, there is, of collusion of people in the Trump campaign with the Russians. And that evidence, of course, includes secret meetings at Trump Tower, the Russian delegations with the promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --the provision of polling data to someone linked to Russian intelligence by Trump's own campaign chair. I could go on and on and on. But, again, the issue of indictment of prosecution, that is Bob Mueller's decision, and I have great confidence in him. I think we all owe him a debt of gratitude for conducting this investigation in such a professional manner. And I'm going to reserve judgment on that-- those prosecutorial decisions until we see the evidence. But I have great confidence in how he's conducted himself.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you be attending the briefing that the AG gives to those key members of Congress? Speaker Pelosi has said she will boycott it.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Look, I think the speaker is quite right. It is not going to be satisfactory for the attorney general of the Justice Department to brief eight of us. The so-called Gang of Eight, in a classified setting and say, okay, we discharge our obligation. We don't have to tell the rest of the country anything. That's not going to fly. This report is going to have to be made public. And of equal importance the underlying evidence is going to have to be shared with Congress because that evidence not only goes to the issue of criminality but also goes to the issue of compromise. And, remember, this began as a counterintelligence investigation into whether people surrounding the President--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --or the President himself were compromised by a foreign power. And there's still a lot of reason to be concerned about this President's relationship with Russia and Putin. And so that evidence needs to be provided so we can make sure that we protect the country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So you will boycott that briefing?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Look, the briefing I think we're going to get this weekend is only going to be very top line conclusions--  MARGARET BRENNAN: The one to the Gang of Eight--  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --that aren't going to--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --specifically?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, they have made no request to brief the Gang of Eight at this point.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: And there may be a point down the road where there is certain information that goes to sources or methods that are of such great sensitivity that needs to be briefed confidentiality-- confidentially. But that is not going to be a-- a reason to withhold evidence from the American people. So we're going to make sure that that is not some ruse that the Justice Department attempts to use.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you might attend those if they are held? Though Speaker Pelosi says she won't.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: You know I don't-- I don't think the speaker is ruling out that at some point down the line, there may be very specific information that needs--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --to be shared in a closed session, either with the Gang of Eight or with the intelligence committees in House and Senate. But she is determined and we are all determined that this report cannot be buried. That no stratagem of briefing a select number of members will avoid the need for transparency here. The public--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but you know--  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --ought to see the product of this work.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, though, that, you know, declination decisions are typically kept confidential and that there is a lot of information in here that will-- will be protected essentially. It was-- it was gained through grand jury subpoenas it's not things that can necessarily just be blanketed out there as a press release. So is this a beginning of a negotiation, essentially, in terms of what you're asking to be made public?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: It's a very important question. And I think what the-- the public needs to understand is the rule against providing information as to people not indicted gives way when there is a paramount interest in transparency. And over the last two years, the Justice Department under Rod Rosenstein made the decision that the interest in transparency and because Congress insisted meant that the Justice Department should provide over eight hundred and eighty thousand pages of discovery in an investigation in which no one was indicted. Information about Hillary Clinton and Bruce Ohr and Peter Strzok and Lisa Page and others, Andy McCabe, that all was provided notwithstanding there were no indictments in that investigation--  MARGARET BRENNAN: That wasn't a special counsel--  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: The Justice Department--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --that wasn't a counterintelligence investigation. It was-- it was a different case.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, actually-- actually, a great many of those documents, thousands of pages of those documents, pertained to the Mueller investigation were part of a counterintelligence investigation. There were FISA application materials that were declassified and made public. There were interviews that went into those applications and other materials that were pertaining to an ongoing investigation that had deep counterintelligence implications. So they did all of that and they cannot maintain now that we only do that for Republican Congresses--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --vis-\u00e0-vis Democratic candidates. We won't share information; we won't be transparent about the Trump investigation. That will never fly with Congress and it will never fly in the court if we have to go to court to insist on that evidence.  MARGARET BRENNAN: It took Bob Mueller two years to come to these conclusions and there were no indictments related yet, to conspiracy with Russia. What is it that your committee can find because many will look at this and just say Democrats are purely focused on impeachment? Is that the end game?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: That's not the end game. I think the speaker's made very clear that in the absence of very compelling evidence that there isn't going to be an impeachment. But one of the reasons why it's so important that this underlying evidence be shared with Congress is that so we don't have to reinvent the wheel, so that we don't have to go through all the same interviews as Bob Mueller and, indeed, there is some evidence in the possession of the Justice Department that the Congress can't get any other way. They've seized the hard-- hard drives, for example, reportedly, from search warrants executed on Roger Stone, other materials from search warrants on Paul Manafort. We can't get much of that information except through the department. So if there's an interest and we certainly have one in Congress, in expedi-- in-- in expeditious investigation in Congress that information will allow us to do that. I want to say this, too--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --that our obligation is not the same as Bob Mueller's which is to decide who to prosecute. Our obligation is to find the facts, make them clear to the American people, take corrective action, protect the country particularly if there's evidence that the President is somehow--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --compromised by a hostile power.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We will wait and see. Congressman Schiff, thank you for joining us.  We now turn now to Congressman Jim Jordan, ranking member on the House Oversight Committee and a member of the Judiciary Committee and he joins us from Columbus, Ohio. Congressman, as we've said, no one really has seen this report just yet.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN (R-Ohio/@Jim_Jordan/Oversight Committee Ranking Member): Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you actually claim vindication? A lot of Republicans seem to be seeing that here.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: Well, we want to read the report first. But what I do know is not-- to date not one bit of evidence to show any type of coordination, collusion, conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election. So that's been-- that-- we- we've sort of known that for a long time--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Or at least none that rises to beyond a reasonable doubt--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: Well--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --and can be prosecuted.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: Well, under-- understand this, when this thing all started back in May of 2017 the Justice Department had already been looking into this issue for-- they-- they started in 2016, late summer 2016. And all the way up until the special counsel's named in May of 2017 there was no evidence of collusion at that point either because when we deposed Lisa Page, when we deposed Jim Comey they both told us, up until the point that Comey left the FBI, there was no evidence of collusion. Now, twenty-two months later there still doesn't appear to be any evidence of any type of coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to impact the election. We'll read the report and we'll see what it says but that seems to be the-- the facts as we know them.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So you no longer believe that the Mueller Report is a hoax or a scam as the President has called it?  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: I-- I've not called it that. In fact, the President has let the Muell--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President called it that.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: The President-- the President has let the Mueller report--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: --play out. I me-- understand this, Margaret, everyone got what they-- what they-- go back to May of 2017, all the Democrats, all the Republicans in Washington, DC said we need a special counsel and they got the guy they wanted. They got Bob Mueller, the guy who everyone said is right next to Jesus--can almost walk on water, they got the guy they wanted. He now has his report. And-- and it looks like--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right and you--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: It looks like it's not going to be--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --tried to file articles of impeachment against the deputy attorney general who-- who helped put him in place. Sir, you have been a skeptic of this probe from the beginning--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: That's because-- that's because--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you now--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: --Rod Rosenstein-- well--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --accept its findings and believe it has integrity?  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: Well, all I'm saying is the Democrats when they-- now-- it seems like they now think that this is not going to be the bombshell they thought it was going to be. So they are launching all kinds of new fishing expeditions. They bring in Michael Cohen for goodness sake. They're first announced witness of the hundred and sixteenth Congress. Michael Cohen, a guy who's going to prison in six month-- or six weeks for lying to Congress. They bring him in and what does he do? He lies to Congress again. We think at least seven times. So Jerry Nadler sends eighty-one letters to sixty-some different people.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: So they're launching all kinds of new fishing expeditions to find more information--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: --because they're bound and determined to go after the President--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --but you-- but Congressman you know--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: --in spite of the amazing--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --that as we said at the beginning of the program, thirty-four people were indicted. Three companies, aides including the--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: --Margaret--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, campaign chairman Paul Manafort.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: Margaret--  MARGARET BRENNAN: They had admitted to breaking the law.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: What was--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So can you admit--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: --the central--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --that this was not a witch hunt?  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: What was the central charge of the Mueller investigation-- of the special counsel investigation? It was to look at potential--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Any link to coordination between Russia and anything related.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: Ex-- no it was to--  MARGARET BRENNAN: And anything else that came up--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: Any type of coordination or conspiracy or collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to steal the election. Remember what Adam Schiff said. We have more than circumstantial evidence to point to collusion to do just what the charge was. But we have not seen any of that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But, Congressman, because you're deciding to put aside those indictments and guilty pleas it-- it appears--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: I'm not saying that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --you're picking and choosing this, when you're-- you're picking the outcome you like and looking away--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: No, I'm not.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --from the ones you didn't.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: No, I'm not. Those people they did things wrong.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: And they're going to have to pay the consequence for that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: We understand that. But that wasn't the charge of the special counsel investigation. It was to look at that one fundamental issue. We'll read the report and see what it says. But all indications are that there is no-- and no-- and I-- I've seen no evidence. Now almost two and a half years of them investigating, I've seen no evidence of any type of coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to impact the election.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: And neither have you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but that's not the-- the question we're waiting to see this report. But-- but, more broadly, I mean for Americans. Should they look at this and-- and while yes, there's no indictable offenses that we have seen, yet, from the special counsel related to the Russia probe or the-- the allegation of conspiracy with Russia. There are all these instances that ethically look questionable that-- the President's son agreeing to meet with Russian intermediaries to get dirt on Hillary Clinton. A number of different things along the way that came to light in the course of this investigation, not disclosing to primary voters that the President was seeking business deals in Russia. Do those things morally sit right with you?  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: Look, we'll-- we'll read the report and we'll see what-- what the special counsel has to say about that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, those are things we already know and I'm asking you ethically, morally?  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: Here's what I know about the President. In two-- in two and a half years as President of the United States, we have seen regulations cut, we have seen taxes reduce, we have seen the economy growing in an unbelievable rate, we have seen--  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're diverting.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: --the lowest unemployment in fifty years. No, I'm telling you the truth. I was with the President last Wednesday in-- in-- right here in Ohio, and I saw the response he got from citizens in our district. The people lined up on the streets cheering him because--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But those specific examples--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: --they-- they know we have Gorsuch and Kavanaugh--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --you're-- you feel--  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: --on the court.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --ethically, are fine with you.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: I-- I'm saying, that wasn't the charge of the Special Counsel investigation. We're-- we're focused on Mister Mueller's report and I hope it's made public, I hope Bill Barr is-- he said he's going to follow the law, make as much public as he can in consultation with Rod Rosenstein and Bob Mueller and we will read the report. But what I do know is it's been an amazing two and a half years under the President's leadership and I think the American people appreciate that. And I know the central charge of the special counsel investigation was to look at collusion and there has been zero evidence, zero evidence of any type of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election. Other things that have happened, people who've done things wrong, they're going to be held accountable for that. That's the way it's supposed to work in this great country, and that's-- but-- but-- on the central issue, no evidence whatsoever.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you very much.  REPRESENTATIVE JIM JORDAN: You bet.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in one moment. Don't go away.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. He is the fourth ranking Democrat in the House leadership and joins us this morning from New York City. Congressman, welcome to FACE THE NATION. No one has seen the details of this report yet. What is it that you were actually looking to get and hear from the attorney general today? What can we expect?  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-New York/@RepJeffries/Democratic Caucus Chairman): Well, the American people deserve to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. This is a serious national security investigation. Seventeen different intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered with our election, attacked our democracy, in order to try and artificially place Donald Trump at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. That's a very serious thing. Which is why, as House Democrats, we are saying that the Department of Justice should release the entire report, as well as, the underlying documentation. We don't want to see simply crib notes. We don't want to see an outline. We don't want to see an executive summary. We need to see everything so that the American people can draw conclusions on their own.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But redactions, declassifications, I mean this is confidential information. You'd have to go to court. This is going to take some time.  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, we certainly understand that to the extent there are sources and methods that need to be protected, those type of redactions are appropriate. But beyond that, we think that in the interest of full disclosure and complete transparency, the American people paid for this report. They deserve to get an understanding of the conclusions that were drawn. Four hundred and twenty members of Congress voted for public disclosure.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Zero members of Congress in the House voted against it. The American people overwhelmingly have said--more than eighty percent--Democrats, Republicans and independents, that the report should be disclosed. That's what we expect.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Should we expect the attorney general and the special counsel to face questioning in front of your committee? In front of the television cameras?  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, I think that certainly is a possibility. But let's take the first step in terms of the full disclosure of the report and the underlying documentation. The American people deserve to know whether Donald Trump is either(a) a legitimate president; (b) a Russian asset; (c) the functional equivalent of an organized crime boss or (d) just a useful idiot who happens to have been victimized by the greatest collection of coincidences in the history of the republic.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman--  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Let's see what--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --it sounds like you've come to your own conclusions.  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: That's a question. I haven't drawn a conclusion. What I'm saying is that this is a serious--  MARGARET BRENNAN: The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, said it is very clear the President obstructed justice. He said that before the report even came out or was concluded. Republicans are going to look at this and just say you are making a case for impeachment regardless of what is presented to you by the attorney general.  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: We've been very clear, Democrats didn't run on impeachment. We didn't win the House of Representatives back on impeachment. We are not focused on impeachment. Actually we're focused on executing are for the people agenda. We want to lower healthcare costs for everyday Americans. That's what we promised, that's what we're working on. We want to enact the real infrastructure plan. We have a trillion-dollar plan; it would invest and create at least sixteen million good-paying jobs. We want to fix our crumbling bridges, roads, and tunnels and airports and mass transportation system. And we also want to bring our democracy to life. That's why we passed HR 1. That is our focus, Margaret. That will continue to be our focus moving forward.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actually predicting that legislation is going to get through in the next two years and not just be eaten up by all the political arguments around this report and the investigations that are ongoing in the House?  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: I certainly believe that that is possible. We are going to try to do everything we can to try and find common ground. We're going to lead by example and try to move for--  MARGARET BRENNAN: What actually gets done?  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, one, we're going to work to try to drive down the high cost of lifesaving prescription drugs. We believe that the federal government should have the power, perhaps, through Medicare, to use its bulk price purchasing ability to negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of the American people.  MARGARET BRENNAN:  How are you going to work--  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: The President hasn't got--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, go ahead. How are you going to work with the President on doing that though when some members of your caucus have already been calling for his impeachment going back to two years prior?  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, Nancy Pelosi has been very clear about impeachment and I share her view, and so do the overwhelming majority of the House Democratic Caucus. We are not going to proceed unless the case is compelling, the evidence is overwhelming, and, most importantly, public sentiment around impeachment is bipartisan. So, we are going to keep our focus on things like lifesaving prescription drugs and reducing its high price and we believe the President has come to Congress, spoke to the nation during the State of the Union address and said he agrees, we should try to work together to get that done. He has also indicated that he agrees with Democrats that we should try to fix our crumbling infrastructure and we're going to try to get that accomplished as well.  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congressman, we will watch and see what happens on all those predictions. Interesting to hear some optimism there.  REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay with CBS News across all of our platforms, television, radio, CBSNews.com and our digital network, CBSN, for continuing coverage of the Mueller report.  We'll be back in a moment with a lot more FACE THE NATION.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our panel, Susan Davis is a congressional correspondent for NPR. Ed O'Keefe is CBS News political correspondent. Jonathan Turley is a CBS News legal analyst and a law professor at George Washington University and Paula Reid covers the Justice Department as well as the White House for CBS. Paula, we're wait-and-see mode. What do we actually expect to hear today if anything?  PAULA REID (CBS News Correspondent/@PaulaReidCBS): We do expect that the attorney general will release the principal conclusions provided to him by the special counsel. Right now, as we're sitting here, the attorney general, his deputy attorney general, a small group of principal advisers are holed up in the Justice Department, pouring over this, deciding what can become public. A lot of this, though, is being driven by the deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. He has actually been the liaison between the special counsel and the Justice Department throughout this process. So, Barr is relying on him heavily. So for anyone who is hoping that the full report gets released, probably bad news for them, because Rosenstein has been clear he does not believe that declination decisions should be released. He's not a fan of releasing the whole report. He wants to stick to the regulation.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is exactly at the heart of what we just heard. Some of the Democrats say they're going to argue about. We'll have analysis of all of that when we come back in a moment.  Some of our stations are going to leave us now, but we will return to talk more about what is in the Mueller report and the future of the battle against ISIS.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return now to our panel. And there is so much to digest, yet so little known, Paula, about what is actually in this report. You know, a lot has been made, as you heard from, some of the President's defenders about the idea there were no further indictments recommended. Does that mean the question of criminality has been closed on here?  PAULA REID: It's great news for anyone in the Trump Tower meetings, specifically, Jared Kushner or Donald Trump Junior, because while that clearly looked like part of the counter-- an intelligence operation on the part of the Russians, it was unclear whether or not anyone in there had committed a crime by showing up. Certainly Paul Manafort should have known better, but it was an open question about Donald Trump Junior and Jared Kushner. So, great news for them that no more indictments. But as we know, the current Justice Department does not believe that a sitting President can be indicted, so now the question is what if anything will they say about the President, because if Mueller found any evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of the President, assumed he would pass that off to the attorney general, and then it's up to him. What do you do with that information? Do you pass it off to Congress for possible impeachment proceedings? You know as well as anyone, Barr has a pretty broad definition of executive power. And so he may be more willing to defer to the President on these questions of possible obstruction of justice. So, that's the question we don't have an answer to right now and why I don't think you're seeing your champagne corks popping at the White House, even though the President, of course, doesn't drink.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it-- it-- but he does tweet--  PAULA REID: He does.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --and we have seen nothing on the Twitter feed yet, Jonathan, about this, which up until now the President has said this is all a hoax, like there's nothing really to trust in this probe. But if there are no further indictments recommended, does he-- I mean how does he handle this relationship with his, essentially, you know, the lawyer for the country--  JONATHAN TURLEY (CBS News Legal Analyst/@JonathanTurley): Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --the attorney general who works for him and the American people?  JONATHAN TURLEY: Well, Bill Barr is going to do exactly what he thinks the law commands. I have known him for years. And he is-- is someone who is not-- you're not able to push him in any direction. I mean he is built like a linebacker. He litigates like a linebacker. He will do exactly what he thinks the law requires. Now, the fact that there's no indictments coming out really does suggest that there was no collusion-related crime, because even though you can't indict the President, you can certainly indict other people, and you can't collude alone.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  JONATHAN TURLEY: So, he can do a lot of things alone. He can tweet alone, but he can't collude alone. So that may, in fact, be a vindication. But that only takes you so far, right? I mean this report, if it gets out, could have a lot of damaging information. You don't want to end up like you're Big Julie on Guys and Dolls, saying thirty-three arrests and no convictions. That's not exactly a powerful argument for a President to make.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you heard from Congressman Schiff. I mean, putting the politics aside, he-- he sort of drawing this line saying, you could have still seen conspiracy but it didn't rise to the level of being able to indict.  JONATHAN TURLEY: Well, I think that--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, will the President ever be able to clear himself, essentially?  JONATHAN TURLEY: I think-- look, let's not fool ourselves. Most people are going to read the lead on this story, if it comes out that no collusion was found, for most people in this country that vindicates the President of the United States. I mean this is as-- this is as close as DC gets to an organized sport, but for the rest of the country, they will look at that lead. And he has said there is no collusion. And if Mueller agrees with him, it will vindicate him in the eyes of a lot of the citizens.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And how do Democrats digest this, Ed?  ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): I can't wait to see because, you know, it runs the gamut from those who have been under the impression that he will get off scot-free to some sense of there will be other things we need to investigate and justifiably so. What I found interesting this past week, there was a poll from CNN that found sixty-eight percent of Democrats support impeachment. That's a high number, nearly seven in ten, but it's down twelve points from December when it was eighty percent of Democrats believed that way. Why has that happened? Was it because Nancy Pelosi has convinced him that he's not worth it? Is it because they, too, now are reading between the lines and reading all our coverage and realizing that maybe there isn't that much there and we should focus on other things? Or is it the realization that what worked for them in November, focusing on health care, focusing on the economy, education and other issues and not Donald Trump got them into office, got them back the House majority, and might, eventually, help them win the White House? We'll see.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Sue, you heard from Speaker Pelosi this decision she made that she says she will boycott this Gang of Eight, the-- the key members of Congress who are supposed to be or expect to be briefed by the attorney general on the findings, and that would include more information that's been made public. What is the point--  SUSAN DAVIS (NPR/@DaviSusan): Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --of boycotting the briefing?  SUSAN DAVIS: I mean Democrats have made very clear that transparency is going to be their entire strategy here. We know-- we don't know what the report says, but we know principal findings alone are-- is not going to be enough. I do think it is interesting that the call for transparency is coming from across the political spectrum, although-- though their motivations are very, very different. I think Democrats still say, there's two different standards here: there's reasonable doubt in a courtroom; and there is a political standard by which Congress might want to continue to pursue. Republicans I think, to Jonathan's point, that they see this as a potential to clear the President at least in political terms in the eyes of the public. So as much as they can get out in those competing prospects. For Nancy Pelosi, I don't think she wants to be in a position where she-- it's known that she has gone into a meeting with Bill Barr and knows what has been in that and he can't talk about it. So in some ways, I can see it's-- it's self-preservation on her part to say, anything you are going to tell me I want all of these members to know, too. And I do think, more broadly, like, poll-- politics, yes. But this report, and at the core of it, is something that the public really does have a right to know and as much transparency as possible a lot of lawmakers I talked to say they want the public to know it so they can feel confident in their elections.  ED O'KEEFE: To that point, Hakeem Jeffries made the point, too. Four hundred twenty to nothing--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  ED O'KEEFE: --the House approved of measure--  SUSAN DAVIS: Yeah.  ED O'KEEFE: --calling on the Justice Department to release the full report. Nobody went home this past week, had to head town hall and got yelled at for voting yes on that. The public wants to see it. It could be cathartic for people-- for people, frankly, because of that. The other thing to keep in mind, I talked to Chris Coons of Delaware yesterday, he makes a-- a solid point that the Justice Department has done what it has done legally. Congress has the right and the expectation to do what it's going to do politically and constitutionally to oversee this government.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  ED O'KEEFE: Whether people like that or not. The question will be in the tone and the focus of those investigations. Do they go after the raw material because they're convinced that there's something in there that merits more investigation? Or do they just step back and say, look, there's all these other issues? The Trump hotel, he keeps drawing money from that he could be violating the emoluments clause--all the things that are going on at the EPA, decisions made by the Pentagon and the State Department regarding foreign affairs. If they focus in on that kind of transparency and accountability, they may emerge from that, okay, because the American public will realize they are just looking at the rest of the government and doing their job.  PAULA REID: Well, certainly no one wants to vote against transparency, but let me try to argue the other side, which is traditionally in this country you can be investigated by law enforcement. And if you are not charged, they don't want that evidence out there hanging over you. And I know many people have argued, what about the public interest? Is there any investigation where there was ever such significant public interest? Well, yes, let's look at the investigation into Secretary Clinton's use of a private server. Comey there, he decided to err on the side of transparency. And how did that work out? Every word he uttered at that press conference was parsed and it was weaponized for political purposes, not just against her but also against the FBI and the Justice Department. It was used to undermine the legitimacy of the entire organization. Every single word he used, every adjective. Who advised him on that? Well, clearly, they weren't being serious. I think we really have to contemplate the merit of releasing evidence against people who have not been criminally charged.  JONATHAN TURLEY: Yeah. And then--  ED O'KEEFE: Is that Rosenstein's reason then for holding back?  PAULA REID: I think that is part-- this is philosophy. I don't know if it's justification. Remember, he is the one who wrote a memo supporting Comey's firing. Now, there's a lot going on there. But this is someone who has been pretty consistent in terms of not releasing these so-called declination decisions. Not releasing the-- the reason behind not charging someone because in doing that you air evidence against someone who has not been charged.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And privately Republicans do repeat what you just said, which is this is a dangerous precedent to set-- to set, though publicly they challenge and champion transparency. But, legally, here, what are the next steps? And on this question of obstruction, you heard Congressman Jordan say, no, no, no, no, this was all about co-- collusion. Anything else in here is outside the special counsel's mandate?  JONATHAN TURLEY: No. Obviously, it was not outside the mandate. In fact, the mandate had-- was expanded.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.  JONATHAN TURLEY: Now the problem for-- for Donald Trump is if he is cleared of collusion, and maybe even obstruction by the special counsel, who won't clear him necessarily as-- as much as saying I can't find a really actionable criminal case to bring, that's basically breaking out of the orbit of Jupiter, and you still have to go through the asteroid belt. I mean there's now a hundred different investigations that are going to hit you. They are smaller, but there's more of them. And you have to be more nimble. And that means he's got to have greater self-restraint. But it doesn't help when you saw with-- with-- with Congressman Jeffries, you get that glimpse of what's coming, right? Jeffries talked about, look, there's four options here. Either he's a Russian mole, a useful idiot. And I forget the other ones A through D, there was no E, except all the above, right? E could be he didn't commit these crimes, but you-- you notice that's not on the list, and that's going to be what we are going to see coming out.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The knowingly part.  JONATHAN TURLEY: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Not that the Russian interference is in question, but that the President knowingly colluded, coordinated, conspired.  JONATHAN TURLEY: Yeah. He might not have committed a crime.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  JONATHAN TURLEY: I mean, this is-- you know, I-- I guess it's where the process of grieving from, you know, denial to acceptance but it is possible the President did not commit a crime.  PAULA REID: That seems most likely. We have no evidence so far--  ED O'KEEFE: Right.  PAULA REID: --that I've seen that the President has committed a crime. And you know well-- very well. Once you get into obstruction of justice, a lot of that will fall on the attorney general's interpretation of what that means.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But--  PAULA REID: And he has a pretty deferential definition in terms of what executive powers entail, specifically, when it comes to firing your FBI director.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not necessarily absolving anything in the Southern District.  PAULA REID: Right. And the Southern District should concern the President.  JONATHAN TURLEY: Yeah.  PAULA REID: That's a whole another can of worms. He's being investigated in not only his business, his inauguration fund, and these outstanding questions about campaign finance violations. You have Michael Cohen cooperating in that case. And it's easy to impeach Michael Cohen's credibility, but you also have AMI, the publisher of the National Enquirer and its chairman and CEO David Pecker. That is a case where the President has been directly implicated as Individual One. It should concern the President. And I-- I think that his-- his toolbox that he has used quite effectively to attack the special counsel may not work as well in the Southern District.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So what does a bombshell look like if that is a benchmark for impeachment?  SUSAN DAVIS: You know, for-- if-- if you look at the standard that Nancy Pelosi has said, that anything that move towards impeachment would have to be overwhelming and bipartisan, and anything that could get overwhelming and bipartisan support, if you think about how polarized the Congress and the country is would have to be something that directly implicates the President.  ED O'KEEFE: Right.  SUSAN DAVIS: And that is such a high bar. And I do think politically speaking when you look at the Democrats, how much political weight they have put into the Mueller report over the past twenty-two months, every question asked about impeachment, about oversight of this administration, let's see what Mueller says, let's see what Mueller says. What if Mueller says to your point that the President didn't commit any crimes? Then I do think that takes a lot of the air out of the balloon of Democrats. And as they pursue these documents, as they pursue this oversight of this investigation, do they have the own political risk of, yes, looking like they're on a witch hunt?  JONATHAN TURLEY: But (INDISTINCT) the Southern District of New York correct is they've--  SUSAN DAVIS: Absolutely. Absolutely.  JONATHAN TURLEY: --already said the campaign finance crime by Michael Cohen was committed with one other person, who was that? He said I was ordered to do this by Donald Trump. It looks a little odd for the Southern District to say, yeah, he committed a crime but this guy didn't. So what could be dangerous is if there comes out a-- a finding that he could be indicted on that issue--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  JONATHAN TURLEY: --but it would have to wait-- and the statute of limitations might extend beyond 2020.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And that takes us into a whole other conversation, but we have to leave it there. Thank you, all of you, for helping to make sense of this. I know it's complicated and confusing for a lot of people, including all of us at times.  So we will await more detail from the actual report. We will come back with a different story, a look at the future of ISIS. Territorial defeat, does it mean they are no longer a threat?  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: The last remnants of the ISIS caliphate that covered much of Iraq and Syria five years ago were reduced to nothing this week, marking a milestone in the years-long effort to put an end to the terror group. Retired Marine Corps General John Allen was once the special presidential envoy to the global coalition to defeat the group under President Obama. He is now president of the Brookings Institution. Good to have you here.  JOHN R. ALLEN (Brookings Institution President): It's good to see you again, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do we call this victory?  JOHN R. ALLEN: I think it's a way point in the process of eliminating this threat. We saw that this organization would, eventually, become a three-headed monster, if you will. One of it-- one of those heads was the core of the organization in Iraq and Syria. Another is the provincial dimension of it today, which is seen in multiple locations around the world. And the third area is-- is located on the internet. So I think that there has been significant progress in eliminating one of the principal dimensions of this threat. And I have to tell you, in the last forty-eight hours, as I have seen the-- the final operations unfolding in Syria, my thoughts go back to the thousands and thousands of people who suffered from this incredible, abhorrent terror group, but also the thousands who sacrificed their lives to deliver us to this point. And I understand that even a news crew hit an IED coming out of the-- the celebration. And so the sacrifices of our media in covering it, as well, very important I think to this whole process.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I think that's a great point for you to underscore. I want to ask you, the President's language has kind of changed in the past few days. He has declared, you know, victory and said he needs to be given credit for it, but also pointed that, okay, there is still going to be a threat online. In fact, he said, \"While on occasion these cowards will resurface, they have lost all prestige and power. They're losers and will always be losers.\" Is-- is the internet the real battlefield?  JOHN R. ALLEN: No, there's plenty of fighting still to go on. Even in the area that we called the province or core ISIL where the caliphate was at its strongest. There are--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So the threat's not gone on the ground in Syria?  JOHN R. ALLEN: Oh, no, no. There are still thousands of these folks that are unaccounted for. And I-- and I think that we'll-- what we will see in both Iraq and Syria in the months to come will be extensive mop-up operations to try to eliminate those elements that have gone to ground, that-- that will organize in sleeper cells and so on to continue the attack. They haven't given up one iota of their narrative or their obligations or their objectives. And we're going to see that-- we have to eliminate that-- that threat on the ground, and we'll see continued operations not just there, but if you do a-- a connection of the dots of where the provinces of Daesh have been attacking, Daesh being the Arabic acronym. They're clustered in Libya. Ansar al-Sharia is a-- is a Daesh province. Boko Haram is a Daesh province. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis in the Sinai is a Daesh province. Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines. If you see the cluster of these attacks, this is still quite a virulent and dangerous group, as well as being on the internet.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the ground, though, in that-- the so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria, General Votel, the top-- top U.S. commander--  JOHN R. ALLEN: Sure.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --in the Middle East testified recently. And he said the fighters remain unrepentant, unbroken, radicalized. This is a generational problem, and they're melting away.  JOHN R. ALLEN: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Four hundred U.S. service people will be left in Syria. Is that an adequate number to take on that threat?  JOHN R. ALLEN: Mm-Mm. Well, first, Jo is-- Ge-- General Votel is exactly correct. He's one of the greatest soldiers we've minted in the United States, number one. Number two, the forces that were there were overseeing the final operations of the SDF, the Kurds and the Arabs that we've been supporting.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The two thousand that the President has been asked to provide.  JOHN R. ALLEN: That's-- that's correct. And those forces-- their mission was not over for some period of time. Now, eventually, we'd bring them home, and the President is right to want to bring them home, but they were overseeing the essential next phase of this, which is the stabilization of the population. And the paying for that stabilization was happening through our European partners, through the coalition and our allies who've been with us all through this fight. And the-- the critical point about what Jo is saying-- what General Votel is saying here is that if you don't stabilize the population and eliminate the basic human causal factors that makes an organization like Daesh attractive, then we-- we face the potential for a reflash.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's something President Trump says he's not interested in doing.  JOHN R. ALLEN: Well, that's a problem. Then are we prepared to go back and fight again? I mean, we've been in-- in Iraq now twice. Because once we came out too early, and second time we went back because of-- we-- we didn't finish the job.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And Baghdadi is still at large, the leader of ISIS.  JOHN R. ALLEN: We'll-- we'll get him.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Your prediction is?  JOHN R. ALLEN: We'll get him.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Not long.  JOHN R. ALLEN: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd also want to ask you on another topic.  JOHN R. ALLEN: Sure.  MARGARET BRENNAN: This week there were some memos that became public from the Marine commandant--  JOHN R. ALLEN: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --Robert Neller. And they were published-- and he describes the current deployments to the U.S. border, we're talking about here at home, as really hurting and posing a, quote, \"unacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness and solvency.\" Before Secretary of Defense Mattis resigned, he said these deployments were actually kind of good practice. He said they were very good training. Which is it? Should we be concerned our military resources are being used in this way?  JOHN R. ALLEN: Well, it's-- it's both actually. The-- the wise commander, and I would simply say the federal forces, don't normally deploy inside the United States. So that's the first unusual dimension of this. But the wise commander who is-- is ordered to deploy those forces is going to try to make the most out of that deployment and try to get a decent training return on-- on that measure. But, you know, General Neller is a great Marine. He's been a great commandant. And he has assessed and it is his moral responsibility--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  JOHN R. ALLEN: --to provide best military advice to the senior civilian leadership of the United States. He has assessed that both the deployments and the costs associated with those deployments will be paid for in Marine Corps readiness. Marine Corps is the nation's 911 force. It has to be ready to go at a drop of a hat. And if we're stuck on the border--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  JOHN R. ALLEN: --or if our resources are being drained away to be on the border or to provide for infrastructure development on the border, we pay that price in the readiness of the 911 force.  MARGARET BRENNAN: That is quite a warning. Thank you.  We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: Yesterday an explosive device detonated near the NBC News team reporting in Syria, killing a local employee working with them. It is a tragic reminder of the challenges that reporters face when reporting on conflicts abroad. As the fight against ISIS takes a new turn, CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata and his team report for us on what it's been like covering the final push against ISIS in Syria.  (Begin VT)  CHARLIE D'AGATA (CBS News Foreign Correspondent/@charliecbs): Before creeping up to the cliff side overlooking ISIS, we were given strict instructions.  ABDUL KADAR (ph): They don't want any-- any light facing the other side--  ERIN LYLE (ph): Okay.  ABDUL KADAR: --otherwise we will be exposed to snipers.  CARL TAYLOR (ph): Yeah.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: No sooner had producer Abdul Kadar said those words, then we came under fire.  Yeah. It's coming in.  Those are bullets raining in overhead.  We just heard fire coming in over that ridge. Do we really want to go?  Apparently, no, we don't. Wasn't an option. So, on we went. As we peered into the burning ISIS camp below, one prevailing thought was, how on Earth did we get here? We'd been covering the final fight against ISIS since early January. It should have been no surprise that the militant group's reign of terror over nearly ten million people was never going to end easily or quickly. But nobody imagined our home would become a military base run by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces for nearly three months.  Pretty austere.  One of the biggest challenges for producer Steve Berryman was trying to get any communications out.  STEVE BERRYMAN: Well, to drive--  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Nights were bitterly cold, at times just hovering around freezing. Our only source of heat was the fire we kept burning. But over time we managed to make life a bit more bearable.  This is a lot better than it was. Because when we first got here, the floors were filthy, so they've all been cleaned. And we brought some beds in here and some pretty horrible mattresses, but they'll do for as long as we're going to be here.  We didn't want to burden our SDF hosts, so we brought in our own food--  ERIN LYLE: All right.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: --which, thanks to producer Erin Lyle and Carl Taylor on security actually wasn't all that bad.  ERIN LYLE: Pasta with tuna. Charlie, you ready?  CHARLIE D'AGATA: With no running water, showers had to be improvised.  ERIN LYLE: Who wants it next? It's pretty awesome.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: As the fight against ISIS moved further south, so did we.  We just entered Baghuz, the last foothold, if you want to call it that, of ISIS, where they've been fighting for weeks to try to push ISIS fighters, militants back. This is as close as we've ever gotten to ISIS. Actually, it's as close as I've ever gotten in this conflict. It doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.  So this way.  A day spent avoiding snipers on the front line with SDF soldiers stretched into night. We had no choice but to sleep outside, driving further back at that time of night was deemed even riskier than staying put.  MAN: Morning.  ABDI CADANI (ph): (INDISTINCT) My face--  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Cameraman Abdi Cadani freshened up.  ABDI CADANI: That's it.  (INDISTINCT).  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Awful.  ABDI CADANI: Yeah.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Did you sleep at all?  ABDI CADANI: No. I kept thinking someone was going to walk up and shoot us.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Really?  ABDI CADANI: Yeah.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: I wasn't worried about that. It's just the air strikes. And the rat-a-tat-a-tat-a-tat. There were a lot of air strikes last night.  Soon we were on the move again. We did return to that cliff overlooking Baghuz just as the fighting was coming to an end. It seemed somehow fitting that a terror group that had unleashed such brutality upon so many innocent people should face a final humiliating defeat here in a scrap heap in a no-name town. And we had seen it all to the bitter end.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're thankful to report that Charlie and his team have made it safely out of Syria and are headed home. And we send our deepest condolences to our colleagues at NBC News as they mourn the loss of one of their own.  We'll be back in a moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.  Check back soon for a full transcript of this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast.",

            "article_content": "Her family wanted a puppy, so Alicia Barnett dreamed they would find one that was smart, steady and a bit mysterious. She hoped their new addition could share a personality \u2014 and a name \u2014 with the man who has become her rather unlikely idol. At Christmas, her teenage son brought home a 10-week-old chocolate Lab. \"The strong, silent type,\" Barnett observed. And then she named him Mueller, an homage to the stoic special prosecutor appointed to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether members of the Trump campaign played any part. For devoted Democrats like Barnett,\u00a0Robert Mueller\u00a0has become a sort of folk hero since his appointment in May 2017. To them, he represents calm in the face of a storm, quiet in a city of bombast, a symbol of hope that a presidency they view as dishonorable might soon face some type of consequences. \"He gives me reassurance that all is not lost,\" says Barnett, who lives with her family and Mueller the puppy in Kansas City, Kansas. \"I admire his mystique. I admire that I haven't heard his voice. He is someone who can sift through all this mess and come up with a rationale that makes sense to everyone.\" The special counsel \u2014 a 74-year-old registered Republican, Marine and former director the FBI \u2014 has even inspired his own genre of arts and crafts. One can buy Mueller paintings, prayer candles, valentines and ornaments. A necklace, earrings, keychains. A stuffed toy of Mueller in a Superman outfit, cross-stitch patterns, baby onesies \u2014 even an illustration of his haircut to hang on the wall. \"Stare at Special Counsel Mueller's crisp coiffure for three minutes and you will notice a sense of calm come over you,\" that artist, Oakland, California-based Wayne Shellabarger, wrote in his online listing for a $10 print. \"That's a haircut you can set your watch to.\" Mueller has become a boogeyman for many of President Donald Trump's most ardent supporters, as the leader of the investigation the president derides as a \"witch hunt.\" But his fans often speak of him in soaring analogies. Barnett imagines him as a duck's legs: kicking heroically to keep things afloat but under the water, out of view. Karen Adler, a Placerville, California, crafter who sells a coffee mug with Mueller dressed as a saint and wearing a crown of laurels \"for victory,\" describes him as \"Paul Bunyan-esque,\" a man of superhuman labor. Shellabarger thinks of him \"almost like Bigfoot,\" a mystical creature rarely seen in public. Mueller has remained completely silent as the ceaseless speculation about his investigation turned him into one of the most famous men in America. He hasn't given a single interview, and his office does not leak. When Kim Six posted her cross-stitch tribute to Mueller on her Facebook page, some people told her to keep politics out of crafting. The framed stitching featured the letters \"M.A.G.A.\" down the side, a reference to Trump's \"Make American Great Again\" slogan but with these words substituted: \"Mueller Ain't Going Away.\" Her critics assumed she was far-left, but she considers herself a centrist, having voted in the past for moderate Republicans. Her husband is a \"card-carrying Trump fan,\" says the resident of California's Bay Area. They agree to disagree, and she thinks Americans should be able to do the same. To her, Mueller represents a middle ground where facts exist, as opposed to the ideological rants that consume political discourse. \"Let's get all the facts on the table,\" she says, \"and let this impartial person come in and tell us what the truth is \u2014 not spin, just truth.\" She's imagined findings so thorough Congress and voters would be forced to act accordingly. But as the investigation has continued on, with 34 people charged and five sentenced to prison, she's noticed Americans retreating to their corners and rearranging the facts to fit their political position. She's losing faith that Mueller's probe, whenever it does come to an end, will change anything at all. \"How naive I was,\" she says. \"I have this fear, no matter what happens, either side is going to spin it the way they want to. So I don't know anymore if he's the coming savior we had hoped for.\" Carmen Martinez feels doubt, too. She and her business partner in New York City have sold 500 Christmas ornaments and earrings with Mueller's face. They tend to get a rush of orders after major Mueller news: indictments, sentencings. Martinez saw him as the one person who could lead the country out of chaos with truth, and believed his report would push everyone to turn away from Trumpism. But Martinez, a Peruvian immigrant, was shocked last year by the administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the Mexico border. She started to wonder: If images of children in cages don't sway many minds, how could Mueller's report, just words on paper? Others remain hopeful: \"I feel like we're in the middle of a book, like a saga,\" says Janice Harris, a textile artist in Detroit. \"And we're just waiting for the climax.\" She was never a particularly political person before Trump's election \u2014 much of her work featured kittens or dancers. But she was inspired to immortalize Mueller on handmade makeup bags. She had custom fabric printed with Mueller's face, stitched it into her pouches and sold around 50. Wayne Shellabarger has sold two prints of his Mueller haircut illustration. One happy customer wrote that using the print as a meditation aide allowed her to stop taking anti-anxiety medication. \"The world has gone completely insane and topsy-turvy,\" Shellabarger says. \"Mueller's hair is one little shining piece of sanity in a sea of madness, so precise and sober and straightforward and without deceit, absolutely by the book, the opposite of everything that's going on in the world.\" He hung one of the haircut prints in his own living room in Oakland, California \u2014 close to the television, so when he watches the news and his heart starts to pound, he can glance up at it. There is such a thing as fact, it reminds him. \"And that gives me hope,\" Shellabarger says, \"that since he's in charge, the world can be normal again.\"",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Mark Meadows that aired Sunday, December 8, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with the former chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, North Carolina Republican Congressman Mark Meadows. Good morning.\u00a0 REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here.\u00a0 REP. MEADOWS: Great to be here. Great set. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. REP. MEADOWS: I tell you, this is exciting. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're christening it for us. You just heard Chairman Schiff-- REP. MEADOWS: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: --lay out his case. From your perspective, is it inevitable that the House is going to impeach President Trump? REP. MEADOWS: Well, I don't think it's inevitable if you follow the facts. I-I heard Chairman Schiff lay out his talking points, and that's very different than the facts. And I think what we- we need to understand is, is right now- and the president just highlighted this in a tweet- within 48 hours of the hearing that's happening in judiciary tomorrow, we have the judiciary team changing the guidelines in the rules for what impeachment is all about. After the Nixon impeachment effort, the Congressional Research Service put out guidelines and said this is what impeachment should be based on, it's been updated. Now all of the sudden-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REP. MEADOWS: --there's new found evidence by Jerry Nadler and his team. It's because the facts are not supporting their argument. MARGARET BRENNAN: But when I'm asking you-- REP. MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --if you think it's inevitable, that- that's also political calculation. Do you think there will be a single Republican defection to-- REP. MEADOWS: I- I don't see-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --vote alongside-- REP. MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --to impeach the president? REP. MEADOWS: I don't want to speak for all my colleagues, but based on my conversations with them, I don't see a single Republican defecting. They've looked at the facts. They know where we are on this. I think, if anything, there's more pressure on my Democrat colleagues where instead of having just two defections, we may have more than that coming up as the articles get voted on. But inevitably they're going-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know that? Or you're just guessing that you're going to see\u00a0 more than two? REP. MEADOWS: Well, I said there's more pressure on them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. REP. MEADOWS: And- and I have talked to a number of my moderate Democrat colleagues, and- and I know there are a few that are out there that are real concerned. Again, I don't speak for Republicans or Democrats broadly, but I do have conversations, bipartisan conversations on a regular basis. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the wildcards here\u2014 REP. MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014is Rudy Giuliani\u2014 REP. MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014the president's attorney. He was in Ukraine this week. REP. MEADOWS:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And you just heard Chairman Schiff say he- he's not sure exactly what the president meant yesterday when he said that a report is going to be produced to Congress and the attorney general by Rudy Giuliani. REP. MEADOWS: Well, I think if Adam Schiff wants to look at the evidence, wouldn't he, whether it comes from Rudy Giuliani or anybody else, wouldn't he be happy-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2014 REP. MEADOWS: --to see any evidence of- of foreign intervention in terms of the 2016 elections? MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I'm sorry. Are- are you saying you would trust any information Rudy Giuliani produces as credible? REP. MEADOWS: I- I would trust any information that comes to Congress to be able to be evaluated in a neutral manner. So whether it comes from Rudy Giuliani or- or some Democrat witness that's there, if they're bringing information\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REP. MEADOWS: --Congress has an obligation to look at it. We have the oversight responsibility-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2014 REP. MEADOWS: --and so-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --are you--\u00a0 REP. MEADOWS: --to- let me- let me just finish real quickly. So, if- if he's getting relevant information that comes- comes forth from Ukraine, I- I think it's important for us to look at. So many times people have said, listen, Ukrainians never got involved in the 2016 election. Well, that's just not accurate because\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: The issue around impeachment is about the upcoming election and Joe Biden. One- one of your colleagues, Matt Gaetz of Florida, who- who's a fellow Republican, said it's \"weird\" for him to see Rudy Giuliani out there doing this\u2014 REP. MEADOWS: Well I- I'm not suggesting that you\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Giuliani needs to come in under oath? REP. MEADOWS: Well, I- I think that Rudy Giuliani, if he's got evidence that's important to illuminate this, should come in, should testify. I agree with that. The- the other aspect of this that is critically important, that so many people are starting to look at, they're- they're trying to focus on Rudy Giuliani. This impeachment is about withholding foreign aid. And- and Rudy didn't have anything to do with that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well he\u2014 REP. MEADOWS: Actually, none of the promises, none of the- the so- so-called interference in elections actually ever happened. Adam Schiff just was on here, just a few minutes-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Rudy Giuliani has- has said on this program and elsewhere that Joe Biden needs to be investigated. He- he has propagated this idea that's at the center of it all, as you know.\u00a0 REP. MEADOWS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But one of the things the White House did this week was put out a letter saying it's not essentially going to participate-- REP. MEADOWS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in these upcoming hearings.\u00a0 REP. MEADOWS: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But then the president at the same time, and- and Republicans like yourself say he's not getting a fair shake. So, how do you have it both ways of-- REP. MEADOWS: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --of not participating, but then complaining about not being included? REP. MEADOWS: Well, listen, if you can change the rules- MARGARET, I'll play any game with you no matter how talented you are- if I get to control the rules, I'll win every time and that's what the Democrats--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what happens when you win the majority.\u00a0 REP. MEADOWS: But- but no, that's not because what we- we have standards here. And what happens is- is I've been in over 100 hours of depositions. I've seen my Democrat colleagues time and time again leak out what's favorable to them and not favorable to the president. They've done it over and over and over again. That's not fair and should- should the president participate in an unfair process? Absolutely not. He'll get a fair process if it gets to the Senate. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're saying it's not inevitable that that will happen.\u00a0 REP. MEADOWS: Well, I think it's probable but not inevitable.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I also want to ask you, I know you care about government funding.\u00a0 REP. MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Being fiscally responsible. We are about two weeks out from a deadline here on running out of government funding. Do you see the chances- where do you see the chances of a government shutdown? Can they be avoided? REP. MEADOWS: I- I think it will be avoided. I think- I know the president wants to avoid it. I believe based on what Nancy Pelosi says, she wants to- to avoid it. Here's what they're going to have to do though. They're gonna have to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Even without border wall funding?\u00a0 REP. MEADOWS: Well, Nancy Pelosi made an agreement not to go back when we increase the debt ceiling in the- the previous budget deal. She agreed to leave the funding there that is static. And so what I would say, a continuing resolution for those viewers that are out there, continuing the funding as it is for three or four months while we get this impeachment effort off the agenda, is certainly appropriate. I think the president would sign that and believe my Democrat colleagues would as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, good to have you here.\u00a0 REP. MEADOWS: Thank you. Great to be here.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you.",

This week on FACE THE NATION, as President Trump's impeachment in the Democratic-led House appears inevitable, he looks to the Republican-held Senate as his chance to get a, quote, \"fair shake.\" Meanwhile, tensions rise between the U.S. and its adversaries and relations turn chilly with some of our allies. Midweek Speaker Pelosi officially announced the worst kept secret in Washington. NANCY PELOSI: Facts and the constitution give us no choice but to impeach, move forward with impeachment of the President.  MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump has given up on mounting an impeachment defense in the House but is preparing for a fight in the Senate. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: (INDISTINCT) Mister President, I have good news. What's the good news? Tell me, I need good some news. I got people trying to impeach me. MARGARET BRENNAN: But most members of Congress including Speaker Nancy Pelosi don't see the impeachment battle as a laughing matter. MAN: Do you hate the President, Madam Speaker? NANCY PELOSI: And as catholic, I resent your using the word \"hate\" in a sentence that addresses me. I don't hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love, and always pray for the President. And I still pray for the President. I pray for the President all the time. So don't mess with me when it comes to words like that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with the chairman of the Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff. And we'll hear from a key defender of Mister Trump, Congressman Mark Meadows.  Then, the President's visit to London for a meeting of NATO allies results in some awkward photo opens and embarrassing hot mic moments prompting the President to call one ally two-faced. Plus, a new threat from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un leads to the resurrection of an old nickname. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll see what happens. He likes sending rockets up, doesn't he? That's why I call him Rocket Man. MARGARET BRENNAN: White House National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien will weigh in on the renewed hostility. All that and more is just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Tomorrow the House Judiciary Committee will hold another hearing as they write articles of impeachment against President Trump. Democrats are hoping to move quickly with full House debate on the articles and a vote by the Christmas holiday. We begin this morning with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. He joins us from Burbank. Good morning to you, Chairman. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D-California/@RepAdamSchiff/Intelligence Committee Chairman): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we get to impeachment, I want to ask you about this developing story out of Pensacola, Florida, where a member of the Saudi military gunned down three Americans, wounded eight. Is there an indication of motive? Was this terrorism? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: We've gotten an initial briefing on it, and it really is too early to say. We grieve, obviously, for the families of those who were lost. And we're going to press Saudi Arabia to do a full investigation on their end, even as we do one on ours. And I wish the President of the United States, rather than trying to speak for the Saudi government, were pressing the Saudi government for answers. But we're going to make sure that we not only get to the full truth here, but also that we review whatever protocols we have in place for the selection of people that participate in these military training programs both here and abroad, so that this kind of insider attack never occurs again. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be talking about that more with the national security adviser ahead on the program. But I want to switch to impeachment with you. There are already drafts of impeachment articles. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, has indicated that you could see abuse of power, obstruction among them. What are you looking for? What should we expect these articles to be defined as? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we have weighed in all the chairs with Chairman Nadler and his staff as to what we think would be appropriate in this set of articles. I can't go into those particular discussions, but I can tell you as a former prosecutor, it's always been, you know, my strategy in a charging decision, and an impeachment in the House is essentially a charging decision, to charge those that there is the strongest and most overwhelming evidence and not try to charge everything, even though you could charge other things. So, that's my guiding philosophy. There is overwhelming evidence that the President sought to coerce Ukraine into interfering in our election, essentially sought to cheat in our next election by getting a foreign government to weigh in. That is a very serious business, and it imperils our national security. It's a gross abuse of his office. And the President also deeply sought to obstruct the investigation into that wrongdoing. And I think that is the gravamen of the offense here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're going-- well, your committee will be presenting evidence tomorrow before the House Judiciary Committee. Will you include evidence from the Mueller report? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, our committee will present what we investigated, in the intelligence (Audio Cut) set of allegations (Audio Cut), but also the obstruction of Congress. It won't be our committee, the Intelligence Committee, presentation that would go to other issues like the Mueller report. That will be decision that Chairman Nadler will have to make. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think that this should be broadened out beyond the issue of Ukraine? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, again, I'm not going to get to my internal discussions with my colleagues, but I will say that I think we should focus on those issues that provide the greatest threat to the country. And the President is engaged in a course of conduct that threatens the integrity of the next election, threatens our national security by withholding military assistance to an ally at war to our detriment and conditioning other things like a desperately sought after White House (Audio Cut) for election. And that is an ongoing threat to the country, and one that simply can't wait. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well I-- I know Republicans make the point that the aid was ultimately released. But I want to ask you, in your personal opinion, you have seen all of this evidence, are you actually not going to vote to impeach the President? Is there any chance that you wouldn't vote to impeach the President? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, first of all, Margaret, they released the aid because they got caught because a whistleblower blew the whistle, because Congress announced an investigation, and only thereafter, and almost immediately thereafter, were they forced to release the aide. So that's not much of a defense: getting caught. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: But in terms of my own recommendations, look, I'm going to see what articles come out of the Judiciary Committee deliberations. I'll make my views known at that time. But I will say this-- this is precisely the kind of conduct the founders were most concerned about when they provided the remedy of impeachment. That is, that a President of the United States would abuse his power to seek foreign intervention in our affairs, and do so in a way that threatens the ordinary mechanism of removing a President. And that is an election. And you have all of those ingredients here. And what's more, you have a President who is continuing in the malicious conduct out on the White House lawn, still saying he wants Ukraine to help him in the next election with these sham investigations, inviting other countries like China to do the same thing. Rudy Giuliani, even this week-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --is in Ukraine furthering this plot. And so this is an ongoing, clear and present danger to the integrity of our elections and our own national security. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President said yesterday that Rudy Giuliani is preparing a report, that he is going to give to the attorney general and to Congress. What is the plan for this? Is Rudy Giuliani going to come in and testify under oath? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we have subpoenaed Rudy Giuliani for his records and he's refused to comply and refused to cooperate, like so many other witnesses that have refused. Like Pompeo. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, do you know what the President is talking about here? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Look, I have little idea what the President is talking about, except that the President is only too happy to have his personal attorney continue to seek foreign interference in the next election. This is not something that started or ended with Ukraine. It began when the President invited Russia to intervene in the last election. It continued with the President trying to coerce Ukraine to do it now. And it is (Audio Cut) we feel we have to move forward and we simply can't wait for an election in which the President is seeking already to prejudice by foreign intervention. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, in the three-hundred-page report that your committee put out, it included some call logs, including numbers related to Congressman Nunes and a journalists and there has been a lot of blowback on you having published this. Upon reflection, should you have made that public? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, absolutely. And the blowback has only come from the-- the far right. But look, every investigator seeks phone records to corroborate, sometimes to contradict, a witnesses' testimony. And here we had testimony that the President charged Rudy Giuliani with carrying out this plot, that he told Ambassador Volger-- Volker and Perry and Sondland to talk to Rudy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: And, in fact, Ambassador Volker testified about talking to Rudy. And so naturally, we wanted phone records to show they had those conversations and indeed, they did. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: But it's very important to point out, Margaret, we did not subpoena Devin Nunes' call records. We did not subpoena any journalist's call records. And that is simply false information being pushed by the President's allies. But the fact that Mister Nunes-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --or Giuliani or others show up in this scheme doesn't make them irrelevant, doesn't give them a pass. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congressman, thank you very much.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I do want to explain to our viewers, we are having a couple of technical issues you might have noticed there, that's going to happen with a new set. But our CBS News coverage of the House impeachment hearings will continue on this network tomorrow, as well. We'll be back in a moment. Tomorrow, you should tune in to see Norah O'Donnell cover the hearings you just heard Chairman Schiff describe. Stay with us. We'll bring in Congressman Mark Meadows. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with the former chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, North Carolina Republican Congressman Mark Meadows. Good morning. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS (R-North Carolina/@RepMarkMeadows): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here.  REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Great to be here. Great set. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: I tell you, this is exciting. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're christening it for us. You just heard Chairman Schiff-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: --lay out his case. From your perspective, is it inevitable that the House is going to impeach President Trump? REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I don't think it's inevitable if you follow the facts. I heard Chairman Schiff lay out his talking points, and that's very different than the facts. And I think what we-- we need to understand is, is right now-- and the President just highlighted this in a tweet--within forty-eight hours of the hearing that's happening in judiciary tomorrow, we have the judiciary team changing the guidelines in the rules for what impeachment is all about. After the Nixon impeachment effort, the Congressional Research Service-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: --put out guidelines and said this is what impeachment should be based on, it's been updated. Now all of the sudden-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: --there's new found evidence by Jerry Nadler and his team. It's because the facts are not supporting their argument. MARGARET BRENNAN: But when I'm asking you-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --if you think it's inevitable, that-- that's also political calculation. Do you think there will be a single Republican defection to-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: I-- I don't see-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --vote alongside-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --to impeach the President? REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: I don't want to speak for all my colleagues, but based on my conversations with them, I don't see a single Republican defecting. They've looked at the facts. They know where we are on this. I think, if anything, there's more pressure on my Democrat colleagues where instead of having just two defections, we may have more than that coming up as the articles get voted on. But inevitably they're going-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know that? Or you're just guessing that you're going to see more than two? REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I said there's more pressure on them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: And-- and I have talked to a number of my moderate Democrat colleagues, and-- and I know there are a few that are out there that are real concerned. Again, I don't speak for Republicans or Democrats broadly-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: --but I do have conversations, bipartisan conversations on a regular basis. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the wildcards here-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --is Rudy Giuliani-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the President's attorney. He was in Ukraine this week. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you just heard Chairman Schiff say he-- he's not sure exactly what the President meant yesterday when he said that a report is going to be produced to Congress and the attorney general by Rudy Giuliani. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I think if Adam Schiff wants to look at the evidence, wouldn't he, whether it comes from Rudy Giuliani or anybody else, wouldn't he be happy-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: --to see any evidence of-- of foreign intervention in terms of the 2016 elections? MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I'm sorry. Are-- are you saying you would trust any information Rudy Giuliani produces as credible? REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: I-- I would trust any information that comes to Congress to be able to be evaluated in a neutral manner. So whether it comes from Rudy Giuliani or-- or some Democrat witness that's there, if they're bringing information-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: --Congress has an obligation to look at it. We have the oversight responsibility-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: --and so-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --are you-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: --let me-- let me just finish real quickly. So, if-- if he's getting relevant information that comes-- comes forth from Ukraine, I-- I think it's important for us to look at it. So many times people have said, listen, Ukrainians never got involved in the 2016 election. Well, that's just not accurate because-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The issue around impeachment is about the upcoming election and Joe Biden. One of your colleagues, Matt Gaetz of Florida, who-- who's a fellow Republican, said it's weird for him to see Rudy Giuliani out there doing this-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I-- I'm not suggesting that you-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Giuliani needs to come in under oath? REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I-- I think that Rudy Giuliani, if he's got evidence that's important to illuminate this, should come in, should testify. I agree with that. The-- the other aspect of this that is critically important, that so many people are starting to look at, they're-- they're trying to focus on Rudy Giuliani. This impeachment is about withholding foreign aid. And-- and Rudy didn't have anything to do with that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Actually, none of the promises, none of the-- the so-- so-called interference in elections actually ever happened. Adam Schiff just was on here, just a few minutes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Rudy Giuliani has-- has said on this program and elsewhere that Joe Biden needs to be investigated. He-- he has propagated this idea that's at the center of it all, as you know. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But one of the things the White House did this week was put out a letter saying it's not essentially going to participate-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in these upcoming hearings. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But then the President at the same time, and-- and Republicans like yourself say he's not getting a fair shake. So, how do you have it both ways of-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --of not participating, but then complaining about not being included? REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, listen, if you can change the rules--Margaret, I'll play any game with you no matter how talented you are-- if I get to control the rules, I'll win every time and that's what the Democrats-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what happens when you win the majority. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: But-- but no, that's not because what we-- we have standards here. And what happens is-- is I've been in over a hundred hours of depositions. I've seen my Democrat colleagues time and time again leak out what's favorable to them and not favorable to the President. They've done it over and over and over again. That's not fair and should-- should the President participate in an unfair process? Absolutely not. He'll get a fair process if it gets to the Senate. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're saying it's not inevitable that that will happen. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, I think it's probable but not inevitable. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I also want to ask you, I know you care about government funding. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Being fiscally responsible. We are about two weeks out from a deadline here-- REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --on running out of government funding. Do you see the chances-- where do you see the chances of a government shutdown? Can they be avoided? REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: I-- I think it will be avoided. I think-- I know the President wants to avoid it. I believe based on what Nancy Pelosi says, she wants to-- to avoid it. Here's what they're going to have to do though. They're going to have to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Even without border wall funding? REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Well, Nancy Pelosi made an agreement not to go back when we increase the debt ceiling in the-- the previous budget deal. She agreed to leave the funding there that is static. And so what I would say, a continuing resolution for those viewers that are out there, continuing the funding as it is for three or four months while we get this impeachment effort off the agenda, is certainly appropriate. I think the President would sign that and believe my Democrat colleagues would as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, good to have you here. REPRESENTATIVE MARK MEADOWS: Thank you. Great to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. Coming up next, we're going to switch gears, talk about new threats to America with White House National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien. He is standing by. Don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien. Good morning to you, Mister Ambassador. AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN (National Security Adviser/@robertcobrien): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We saw overnight North Korea conduct what it called a very important test. In your view, are they preparing to restart nuclear tests? AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: I hope not. That would be a mistake on the part of North Korea. When we came into office, the-- the President was faced with a very difficult situation in North Korea. President Obama told him it was the most dangerous problem he would face in the world through a combination of-- of tough sanctions and-- and a military show of forces. We were able to convince Kim Jong-un to-- to come to a-- a summit. At that summit, Kim Jong-un promised to denuclearize North Korea. And we expect him to live up to the promise he made at the summit in Singapore. And-- and we hope he'll do so. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, his ambassador to the U.N. said yesterday, denuclearization is already gone out of the negotiating table. The President seemed to nod to that in a tweet this morning. With this test and that statement, it seems an explicit recognition here that on their end, diplomacy is dead. What's the U.S. going to do if they restart tests? AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, I-- I'd be pretty nervous if I was that ambassador, because Kim Jong-un has said publicly that he will denuclearize North Korean penin-- the penin-- Korean peninsula. For a North Korean ambassador to take a contrary position to the-- to his leader, I think in that circumstance, is a-- is a pretty dangerous thing for him to do. Look, we'll-- MARGARET BRENNAN: North Korean diplomats don't usually freelance. You know that. AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: I know-- I-- well, they-- they-- it doesn't end well for them if they do. So I-- I'm a little surprised by that comment by the-- the U.N. ambassador. We'll have to see what happens. We're-- we're continuing with our negotiations, Steve Biegun is going down to the region soon and-- and we'll-- we'll-- we'll see what happens. But we have plenty of tools in the toolkit. If-- if North Korea takes a different path than the one it's promised its people, the people of South Korea, the United States and the world. Kim Jong-un said that he is going to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. if he does not do that, then we'll take that into account. And-- and we've got plenty of tools in the toolkit. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you've got time running out, though, with this end of year deadline Kim Jong-un has set. Do you expect to have the U.S. and North Korea meet? Do you expect President Trump to speak to Kim Jong-un? AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, we'll-- we'll-- we'll see. We'd like to have continued negotiations. We were in Stockholm not too long ago for negotiations with the North Korean team, and we'd like to continue those negotiations. And-- and look, we'd like to see this end up in a peaceful resolution and a-- a resolution that-- that is good for the people of North Korea. They could be a great country. They could have a-- a tremendous economic powerhouse in North Korea instead of-- of starving and-- and being poor. So they've got to make a choice. And-- and we hope they make the right choice. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something here at home. We saw a Saudi military officer shoot dead three Americans, wound eight, at a Pensacola base. Was the shooter acting alone? Is this a terrorist attack? AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: So we don't know yet if he was acting alone. The FBI is investigating and they-- they're-- they've been interviewing, interrogating other Saudi students. Look, to me, it appears to be a terrorist attack. The FBI will have to get into the-- I-- I don't want to prejudge the investigation, but it appears that this may be someone that was radicalized, whether it was here or, you know, it's-- it's unclear if he's got any ties to any other organizations-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean appears-- AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: --but it doesn't look good. MARGARET BRENNAN: --to be? Based on what? Obviously, you're seeing intelligence that-- that we don't know about. You have-- AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --credible intelligence that indicates that this might be part of a broader plot? AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: I-- I-- I don't see anything that there-- that there's a broader plot. I-- I'm watching the same things that you're watching and-- and-- and the public reports. And the-- this is a guy who-- who may very well have-- have said some things on Twitter that suggest he was radicalized. He went out and-- and killed a number of-- of Americans. So, my point is it looks like terrorism. We'll have to see what the FBI investigation shows, what his motivations were. The Saudis have promised full cooperation with the investigation. We're going to take them at their word. And-- and the FBI is-- is very competent doing these things. They'll get to the bottom of it, and we'll have a full report. But I'm-- my point is, it looks from what we're seeing in-- in the public reports that this looks like something that's terrorism or akin to terrorism. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yesterday, there was a prisoner exchange with Iran. It's significant. First time Trump administration has got an American back from Iran. Xiyue Wang was the Princeton scholar released and the U.S. also released an Iranian scientist. That's great for his family. They have great joy. But there are at least four other Americans, and I know you know this well, who are still imprisoned in Iran. Why not make this part of a package deal? AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, what-- what you find out in the hostage business, Margaret, and I did this for-- for several years and we were able to-- to-- President Trump's brought back more wrongfully detained Americans that are hostages than any president in my lifetime. And he's done it without paying concessions, without the pallets of cash, because we want to deter folks from taking hostages again in the future. But what you do is you take the hostages and you take the detainees as-- as you can get them. We would love to have all the Iranian detainees back. I-- I pressed very hard on the Iranians for a year and a half to enter into a consular dialogue, to meet with us, to talk about how we could get all of them home. And-- and we're continuing to do that and we want to see every one of those Americans home. I know each of the family members say these are great people, they're great Americans and-- and they love their family members. We-- we had a great day yesterday for-- for the Wang family. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: Has-- Xi Shou has a-- has a young wife, he's got a young son who he hasn't seen for three years because the-- the Iranians wrongfully detained him, accused him of being a spy. He wasn't. He was a young scholar coming to study their language and study their history, and they threw him in jail instead. We got a great deal out of-- out of this. They wanted a-- an Iranian back who, you can go to the DOJ for details on this, but he was going to court next week. And-- and we felt there was an opportunity here to-- to get-- get someone home, and we did. And we-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You said-- AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: --took the advantage of that opportunity. MARGARET BRENNAN: You say great deal. Does this provide an opening for direct talks with Iran? AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: Look, I hope so. The President has offered to talk with the Ayatollah and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But no promise of that? That was not a condition for this? AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: Well, that was-- MARGARET BRENNAN: This is not a precondition to talk? AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: No. Look, we-- we've had a maximum pressure campaign on Iran. I-- I think that maximum pressure campaign had an impact and-- and-- and-- and was in part responsible for this release. The President has-- has offered to talk to the Iranians without preconditions about a whole range of issues. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: We'd like to sit down and talk to them. But-- but the sanctions and the maximum pressure are not going to be let up until Iran abandons its nuclear program or abandons its malign activities in the region. In the meantime, we'd love to sit down with him and talk about the other detainees. We want to get every single American home-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: --and there's-- there's no one more committed to bringing Americans home than President Trump, and I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. AMBASSADOR ROBERT O'BRIEN: --I think his record shows that. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Ambassador O'Brien, thank you very much for joining us. We'll be back with much more on FACE THE NATION. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of our stations are leaving us now but we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Neal Katyal was acting solicitor general under President Obama, and he lays out the argument for removing President Trump from office in his new book, Impeach: The Case Against Donald Trump. And Neal is here with us in the studio now. Good to have you here. NEAL KATYAL (Former Acting Solicitor General/@neal_katyal/\"Impeach\"): Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: So obviously the title says it all in terms of where you are on this issue. From what you heard from Adam Schiff, the Chairman of House Intelligence and the argument he is laying out, would you advise him to stay narrowly focused on Ukraine or to include other things in these articles? NEAL KATYAL: So the book argues that it should be a narrow focus. Some of the other evidence can come in about Mueller as kind of supporting evidence, that's how the Nixon precedent had it. The articles of impeachment there focused on Watergate, but then it brought in some other things, and here are the most important thing is not just Ukraine, but the President's reaction to Ukraine. I mean he's engaged in unprecedented obstruction, no president in our history has ever done this, saying-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean? NEAL KATYAL: --unilaterally, I don't have-- I declare the entire investigation illegitimate. No witnesses. No documents, no president did that. Nixon contemplated it and even he backed down, and if this President can do it, and this is a central argument in my book, every president can do it, whether it was Obama before and the president Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders or whoever, an impeachment is so central to our checks and balances, and what he is doing is a fundamental threat to our constitution. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do impeachment articles look like? What-- what's a prudent selection? NEAL KATYAL: Yes, so in the book I lay out three articles, one is abuse of power, that he, the President, was trying to cheat in the 2020 election with the help of a foreign government, using his commander-in-chief powers, so it's different than 2016 when he was just a candidate, saying Russia are you listening and stuff like that? MARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans would say 2020 was never mentioned, elections were never mentioned in that so-called transcript. NEAL KATYAL: No. But what was mentioned was his chief political rival Joe Biden, and, you know, the idea that a President could go and withhold foreign aid in order to get an investigation announced, not even completed-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. NEAL KATYAL: --but announced by his adversary is something so pernicious, so dangerous our founders Madison, Hamilton would have cried at such a thought because it's such an abuse of the President's power. So that's Article I. Article II would be bribery, the quid pro quo engagement, but-- you know, the withholding of aid and the withholding of a White House meeting. And then Article III would be is the obstruction of justice as we are talking about. MARGARET BRENNAN: You would keep it on those three? NEAL KATYAL: I would. MARGARET BRENNAN: You tweeted recently that you thought if-- if you go from impeachment in the House to a trial in the Senate and-- and the Senate doesn't essentially convict that you should retry with a new Senate-- NEAL KATYAL: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --after the elections. I mean, doesn't that sound more like a vendetta? NEAL KATYAL: So-- so certainly I didn't advocate that you should do it, I was being descriptive not normative. I said that there is no double jeopardy protection in our Constitution, and I was trying to use that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You're just saying theoretically it is possible to do this? NEAL KATYAL: Well, what I am trying to say here is that the Senate has an obligation to conduct a real trial and I suspect that they will conduct a real trial. MARGARET BRENNAN: What does a real trial look like? NEAL KATYAL: Like-- with-- with witnesses and subpoena power and so the President has stonewalled all of these witnesses, John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney, all of those folks should testify in the Senate, they should be called. And indeed, Donald Trump should testify in the Senate. And so what's happened right now is the President has said I don't have to bother complying with any of this. But in the Senate, in that real trial, there will be subpoena procedures available and the Democrats can call Trump. And I think that they should. MARGARET BRENNAN: You call yourself an extreme centrist. NEAL KATYAL: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: But given your prior work, people will say you're a Democrat.  NEAL KATYAL: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: The argument around this particular impeachment is that we are in this incredibly heated partisan moment, at a degree the country hasn't at least recently withdrew-- NEAL KATYAL: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that there is no way to have a credible impeachment trial, I mean, that-- that argument is made all the time-- NEAL KATYAL: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that this was always going to be partisan and certainly the votes are-- are headed in that way. Do you agree with that? I mean-- NEAL KATYAL: Not at all. So two things. First of all, you know I think my obligation as a constitutional professor is to read each case on its own so I, for example, supported Neil Gorsuch, Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court and testified for him. So, you know, I don't think you just view this through a partisan lens. And number two, I think we have to try. I think this idea that Americans are too weak, this-- this bigotry of low expectations that we can't see facts anymore is so wrong. That's why I wrote the book because I think if you give me thirty minutes with anyone, I can convince them of how bad what Trump did is for separation of powers and why he has to be removed. And-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why don't you think the public or at least the polling that we have seen has the level of conviction that you do? NEAL KATYAL: Because they haven't focused on the facts yet and the Senate trial is the place. It will be a formal, solemn proceeding. And as a litigator, I have seen how trials change opinions. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what does a trial look like? I mean, people think of law and order. They think of courtroom dramas. NEAL KATYAL: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: They don't necessarily have a lot of precedent here. I mean-- NEAL KATYAL: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --this is only really kind of the third, maybe fourth time our country has done this. NEAL KATYAL: Yeah. Well, we've had eighteen impeachments and some Senate trial-- you know, some Senate trials. MARGARET BRENNAN: Of a President? NEAL KATYAL: Not of Presidents. And so I think it looks like a real trial. It looks like witnesses coming forward and arguments being made in the eyes of the nation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you really believe the Republican-controlled Senate is going to subpoena John Bolton or subpoena Secretary of State Pompeo? \u00a0 NEAL KATYAL: The Democrats will have subpoena power and it will go to the chief justice and I've had the privilege of arguing now thirty-nine cases before the chief justice argument, fortieth on Wednesday. And I think he is a consummately fair person and I think he will want this evidence out to the American public. MARGARET BRENNAN: Interesting. And are you advising on this? NEAL KATYAL: No. MARGARET BRENNAN: No. NEAL KATYAL: No, no. Just did-- just through my writing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just through your writing. NEAL KATYAL: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Neal Katyal, thank you. NEAL KATYAL: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good luck with the book. We'll be right back with our political panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: It's time now for some political analysis. Adam Entous writes for The New Yorker and is a brand-new CBS News contributor. Welcome. ADAM ENTOUS (The New Yorker/@adamentous): Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Julie Pace is the Washington bureau chief at the Associated Press. CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe is also with us and along with Josh Holmes, a Republican consultant and former chief of staff to Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. Josh, welcome to the broadcast. JOSH HOLMES (Republican Consultant/@HolmesJosh): Thank you. Good to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, you just heard Neal Katyal decide or describe what a Senate trial could look like if the House goes ahead with impeaching the President. Does your version of what it looks like match his? JOSH HOLMES: No. Well, there are a couple of details that probably worth going over. The first is it's going to take fifty-one votes in terms of calling witnesses. I think Neal suggested that basically the President of the United States could be called or subpoenaed to testify with-- with a-- a Democratic wish list, apparently. Unfortunately, that's going to take-- that would take fifty-one votes from Republicans to-- to try to provide that. And that's obviously not going to happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when he is saying subpoena power there and you could see Cabinet members come and answer questions. JOSH HOLMES: You could see all kinds of different things. I think the most important thing to focus on there is that the-- the President is going to have his first capacity for an official defense in the Senate. And what that is, is basically a witness list of their choosing, that they will come to the senate with, discuss both the contours and the length of how that trial is going to work and try to get Republican buy in and-- and, hopefully, bipartisan buy in to process all of this. But the idea that you can just sort of pull down whomever you want from a Democratic point of view to come testify before the Senate is not true. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the witnesses that you hear in the White House and you hear Republicans say they want to hear from is Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, the current candidate. I want to play a sound bite of Joe Biden on the campaign trail this week where he seemed to be punching back a bit. (Begin VT) MAN: But you on the other hand sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company that he had no experience with gas, or nothing, in order to get access for the (INDISTINCT) to-- for the President. So you're-- you're selling access to the President just like he was. So you-- JOE BIDEN: You're a damn liar, man. That's not true. And no one has ever said that. No one-- MAN: I didn't say you were doing anything wrong. JOE BIDEN: You said I set up my son to work in an oil company. Isn't that what you said? Get your words straight, Jack. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: \"Get your words straight, Jack.\" You-- you don't often hear Joe Biden hit back like that. ADAM ENTOUS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this a-- a tactic? Is this an honest moment? ADAM ENTOUS: I think it is an honest moment. I mean, I think this is the rawest issue for him, anything that has to do with his son. You know, the time-- when-- when his son joined that board, Burisma, the company in Ukraine, his other son Beau was, you know, a year away from dying and it was just a very painful moment for the family. And, you know, the policy that Joe Biden had with his son was kind of a don't ask, don't tell. Hunter wouldn't talk to his dad about his business activities and his father wouldn't ask. And so to have his son dragged into this is very hard for him because it wouldn't be happening if his father wasn't running for President and he knows also where his son is. I mean, he is-- I mean, he is-- I'm not even sure exactly how sober he is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ADAM ENTOUS: --at times. He struggled for years with his addictions and his dad knows that. And during that period of time, he was in a very bad place. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you-- you spent a lot of time with Hunter. ADAM ENTOUS: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have written about him. And I know you've said it's also painful because it was about the son who passed, who was the one who reigned in Hunter from some of his worst instincts-- ADAM ENTOUS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and he is not there. ADAM ENTOUS: Right. So when-- you know, whenever Hunter started drinking again, it was Beau that would take him to the airport so he could then fly to get treatment, right? It was always Beau who was the one trying to save him. And when, you know, during his last year of life, Hunter was just a wreck, which is when this is all going on, and so you can-- you know, we saw in the impeachment hearing, a one-- one State Department official testified that he had concerns that he had raised with-- with members of Biden's staff and was told that Biden didn't have the bandwidth at that time to deal with it-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ADAM ENTOUS: --because he was still dealing with, you know, the death of, the death of Beau. And so this has been consistent in Joe Biden's life. This-- anything that has to do with his family, anything that-- particularly since Beau died, that has to do with Hunter is incredibly sensitive for him, which is the reason why actually it-- it-- it's an effective-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ADAM ENTOUS: --issue for Republicans to push on. But it's also-- you know, it's something that maybe people watch and they can realize, well, this is a guy who actually really does care about his kids. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the chances, Ed, of Joe or Hunter Biden coming and testifying-- ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Well, once again you need fifty-one senators-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ED O'KEEFE: --to agree to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: And a lot of them don't want to do that-- ED O'KEEFE: Exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: --to a former colleague of theirs. ED O'KEEFE: Exactly. Exactly. And so-- and-- and we've heard from enough Republicans or enough of them have inferred that that might be a bridge too far. Certainly other people involved, they-- they would probably be fair game, but the Bidens, less so. And from a raw political standpoint, his aides, this week, thought this was a fantastic moment for him because it showed fire in the belly, it gave them-- it gave voters a sense of how he would respond to this if he was asked about the situation by either an opponent or by President Trump. Clearly others thought this looked a little weird because in that exchange at one point it sounded like he called the man fat instead of Jack. You can listen to it yourself and decide. And there were some other missteps and-- and misspoken words over the course of this nineteen stop bus tour that he made, but it was called \"No Malarkey\" and in that moment he certainly didn't want to take any of it. And his aides think that it could help prove to voters if you've got concerns about how he'll handle it. That's how he'll handle it. MARGARET BRENNAN: How he would handle a debate stage moment against President Trump. Julie, you saw Kamala Harris step out of the race this week. Is she a candidate to now go be the VP in the Biden ticket if he gets a nomination? JULIE PACE (The Associated Press/@jpaceDC): I think she certainly would have to be, not just for Joe Biden but for any Democratic nominee. Kamala Harris has a really interesting background, certainly her profile as-- as the highest profile black female politician in the country right now. I do think one dynamic, though, between Biden and Harris to watch for is that dynamic from that first debate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JULIE PACE: Joe Biden took that moment incredibly personally when Kamala Harris opened up her remarks by saying, I don't think you're a racist but-- and part of the reason actually to get back to what we were talking about is that Kamala Harris and Beau Biden were very close when they were both attorney generals for Delaware and-- and California. You know, politics is politics, if he is the nominee and he thinks that Kamala Harris can help him win the presidency, you can put a lot of hard feelings aside but that's certainly was a moment that really stuck with him for quite some time. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Josh, when Senator Harris stepped back this week, her retort to the President was I'll see you at your trial, sir. Reminding everyone that she's a prosecutor and now she will be there for-- for that trial. How much of the 2020 campaign time schedule is actually factoring into Republican planning? JOSH HOLMES: Yeah. Well, you know, she'll have no more or less role than any other senator in the body and I-- I think that underscores another challenge that a lot of these Democratic 2020 candidates have here. There are not as many senators as there were at the beginning but there still are a few, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and others. So the way you look at it is that they're going to have a closing argument going into the Iowa caucuses is largely spent in Washington, DC, talking about the impeachment trial of President Trump. So former campaign manager, I can't imagine trying to manage a closing message to voters that you can't control it all. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JOSH HOLMES: (AUDIO CUT) --to the second, third, fourth week of January they literally are walking into an Iowa caucus without even being in Iowa. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that might-- maybe factor into some thinking in Republican leadership, we could see not just the month of January but-- I mean, how long is this going to last? JOSH HOLMES: Well, you never-- I mean, the contours, again, are going to have to be set with fifty-one votes. And I-- I think the one thing that Senate Republican leadership is absolutely committed on doing. And you saw Pat Cipollone and others come up to the Hill and talk to Republican senators about this, is they want a full trial. They want the President and his team to be able to provide a full witness list that they have the first kind of access to the American people to push back on the charges that Adam Schiff and others have brought. So that could take a while, but, again, I-- I think a lot of that is going to be determined by what the specific articles say. And-- and I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. JOSH HOLMES: --I didn't hear that from Mister Schiff this morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we might know more by the end of this week. We'll take a quick break here but I want to come more-- come back with more on the White House strategy and a lot-- a lot happened this week, as always. But we'll be right back with more from our panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with our political panel. I-- I want to button up a few things on impeachment. Julie, you heard President Trump while he was overseas, politics no longer stopping at the water's edge unload on Adam Schiff. I mean, he called him a deranged human being, a maniac, a very sick man. This is someone who's trying to impeach him and in the process of writing the articles against him. What is the White House strategy here? JULIE PACE: I think White House strategy is to very quickly get through this House process and move on to the Senate. They basically have accepted the fact that the President is going to be pe-- impeached. They want to move on to Senate, but I do think that there is a little clarity that needs to be brought to some of the White House officials about what this process actually looks like. I mean, Josh was making this point. This is not a situation where the Republican senators are going to be out there on the Senate floor actively able to defend the President. This is going to be a process that's run by managers-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JULIE PACE: --that has witnesses come forward. So it's a little bit different than I think what the President has in mind right now, but certainly they think that this is a better forum for them. They think this is an opportunity to go on the offensive and bring forward people who might add to the picture that the President wants to paint, which is of a Democratic administration under a Vice President Joe Biden who is engaged in corruption, which is unproven. So I do think it's a pretty high bar if you're the White House to try to push in that direction, given the real lack of evidence that there is to bolster that case. MARGARET BRENNAN: So this isn't going to look like your average courtroom drama? JULIE PACE: This is not going to look like your average courtroom drama. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Adam, Rudy Giuliani, the word bold, the word brazen has been used, when I was talking to Republicans about this decision of him to go to Ukraine this week and to meet with individuals who are part of this entire impeachment proceeding. Is there a strategy there? You know, Mark Meadows on this program was saying he would-- he would look at the information that Rudy Giuliani brings back. Is that actually going to be introduced? ADAM ENTOUS: Yeah. I don't really know what the plan is for that. I mean, I did-- I did talk to somebody who traveled with Giuliani on the trip and so that-- originally he was going to Budapest to see Lutsenko, the former prosecutor general, and then as a last minute they made a decision to go to see Shokin, his predecessor, the former prosecutor general who was allegedly fired by Biden, allegedly, again, to protect his son. His strategy is clearly just to kind of keep the-- the-- the-- you know, keep-- keep fanning the flames of a, you know-- you know, innuendo, half truths, you know, rumint that these Ukrainians are giving him. You know, I-- I spent a lot of time there with some of these characters and, you know, they pretty bluntly told me that, you know, they are just feeding Giuliani in many cases what he wants to hear. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ADAM ENTOUS: Giuliani is very eager to accept this information that he's getting. He doesn't question it. You know, he is just trying to put it out there hoping that it will-- some of it will stick and, you know, his-- this is not that different from what was contained in the dossier that he provided to the-- to Pompeo at the State Department back in-- I think it was April or May. MARGARET BRENNAN: That ended up with the inspector general. ADAM ENTOUS: Correct, which if you go through it carefully, you realize it's-- it's just a lot of innuendo, assumptions, false information. I mean, there's some things in there that are true but most of it is-- is-- is not accurate. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, Ed, about a key interview this week, our own Gayle King-- ED O'KEEFE: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --sat down with Mike Bloomberg, former mayor of New York, for his first interview since he declared that he was going to run. What did you make of-- of some of his give-and-take with her? ED O'KEEFE: Two-- two things stuck out. The one that he got a lot of gut for-- right at the beginning was-- he was asked about comments that Cory Booker had made about the increasing lack of diversity now at the top tier of the Democratic race and Bloomberg sort of brushed it off and said, well, he supported me once, he sat on my board, he's well-spoken, and those are buzzwords for black and Latino candidates, minorities all across the country who've heard too much of that, Booker called him out for it, Bloomberg apologized. The more effective answer he had, though, was to the question about the fact that he's entering this race and basically bankrolling it on his own. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ED O'KEEFE: And he reiterated an argument he made when he ran for mayor, which is I'm paying for this on my own. I won't accept a salary, therefore, I can't be bought. Everyone else is doing the same thing but they're asking other people for money, and they'll owe somebody a favor at some point. With me, you don't have that. You know who else made that argument? Donald Trump. JULIE PACE: Trump. ED O'KEEFE: And guess what? It worked. And who's Mike Bloomberg trying to win over? The same kind of people who may go back and forth between both parties-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ED O'KEEFE: --who probably voted for Donald Trump. He's unloading sixty million dollars in TV and radio so far, about five million across digital platforms. If you're an American with a TVs or a-- a phone, you have probably come across this now-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ED O'KEEFE: --in the last week. And it w--ill continue to happen and we will see probably right after the holidays whether it's sticking or whether he's struggling. MARGARET BRENNAN: What-- what do you think his chances are of winning over some of the Republicans I just talked about? JOSH HOLMES: Well, look, I think you're only buying something if you get a product in the end and I-- I haven't seen any evidence that voters at this point have gravitated towards Bloomberg and away from some of his Democratic primary rivals. But the idea that he's gravitating that any sort of voters in the center that has a right of center view is gravitating towards Bloomberg, I think it's way far afield. At this point, the-- the issues that define Michael Bloomberg in his post mayoral sort of activism category are all exclusively not only left of center but are almost litmus-- litmus tests in a conservative electorate. But gun control, you know, banning soda, I mean, getting rid of coal, his energy stances. All-- MARGARET BRENNAN: He was a Republican at one point. JOSH HOLMES: Right. It's pretty hard to make that case now. And I think voters are-- are going to look at that in the context of a Democratic primary. And, again, it's going to be very, very difficult for somebody like Michael Bloomberg to say he's an actual centrist. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's brokered convention you hear rumored again and again. Julie, what about the point Cory Booker made on-- on race this week? He said for Kamala Harris that, you know, the Democratic Party essentially takes black women for granted in terms of voting. What's going to happen with Biden and his ability to-- to court the vote that-- that Cory Booker says isn't show up? JULIE PACE: Democrats are in this really interesting position right now because you have a-- you have a Democratic electorate that is incredibly diverse and we have seen in election after election the power, in particular, of black women. They have really delivered elections for Democrats over and over again. I do think the party is-- is recognizing that. I don't think they are take-- being taken for granted but we've had this historically diverse Democratic field that is now at a point where the top frontrunners, every candidate that has qualified for the next debate is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. JULIE PACE: --white. Cory Booker is trying to argue that the Demo-- Democratic Party-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. JULIE PACE: -- (INDISTINCT) for that, that the rules are-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. JULIE PACE:--sort of brokered against them right now, but that is the reality of where we are. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Before we go, we want to thank everyone behind the scenes at CBS for all their work on this new set. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Vice President Mike Pence that aired Sunday, October 27, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: And joining us here in studio with more details of the raid is Vice President Mike Pence. Good morning to you, Mr. Vice President.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Good morning Margaret.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You were in the Situation Room watching this-- VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I was.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --as it happened. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I was.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell me about the decision behind- when was it made? Who made it? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well first let me just say this is a great day for America. Al-Baghdadi, the most wanted man in the world, is dead. And it's a tribute to the courage of our Armed Forces, Special Forces that executed the raid on the compound last night, but it's also a tribute to the decisiveness of President Donald Trump. We first received information early in the week about the possibility of his location-- MARGARET BRENNAN: This was CIA?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: It was through our intelligence agencies that the president rightly commended today. Through a combination of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, we believe we knew where he would be. And by Thursday afternoon, the president and I were informed that there was a high probability he would be at the compound in Idlib province. The president immediately directed our commanders to develop military options. Those were presented to the president at the White House on Friday morning. But it was Saturday morning that we received the actionable intelligence that allowed the decision that the president had made to move forward to happen. And it is a- it was incredible to be in the Situation Room and to see this unfold in real time as our special forces were on the ground, to see their professionalism over a period of two hours. But the wor- America and the world are safer today with the leader of ISIS dead. MARGARET BRENNAN: According to U.S. intelligence though, ISIS has about eight branches.\u00a0 It- it had that-- VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: -- battle ground its lost in Iraq and Syria, but it has, as you know, a significant force in Afghanistan and inspiration all around the world. So what impact will taking out Baghdadi have on the rest of those tentacles?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well as the president said today what- what the United States of America demonstrated last night is that this President, this country will be unrelenting in our fight against ISIS or any terrorist organization that threatens this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what does that mean for the drawdown of U.S. forces from Syria? Does that mean that Iraq has agreed to now host the majority of the presence being pulled out from Syria? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well we- we have a military presence in Iraq. We have as the president's made clear an ongoing military presence in parts of Syria. But- but to be clear you- you know the president looked at the deployment of American forces in between traditionally Kurdish Syria and the Turkish border and essentially believed that that was not the right place for our forces to be. American forces went into Syria, worked with our Syrian Kurdish allies to destroy the ISIS caliphate. The last inch of territory the ISIS caliphate was captured in March. And the president looked at the circumstances where we had American forces essentially providing a safe zone patrol on the Turkish border. That was not the mission. MARGARET BRENNAN: So how many-- VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I have to tell you-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --are staying?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I have to tell you as the- as the father of the United States Marine, I- I couldn't be more grateful that we have a commander in chief that is always asking about- about you know whether or not American forces have to be in harm's way-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you-- VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: And if they're not on the mission- they weren't on the mission. ISIS the caliphate had been destroyed so the president said we'll bring them home. But last night, the president of the United States proved to the world that our fight against ISIS is unrelenting. And by- and by killing the leader of ISIS-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --the active operational leader of ISIS, who it was reported just two weeks ago was giving orders to ISIS fighters in Syria, we believe we'll have a measurable impact on the effectiveness of that terrorist organization. But we're not going to let up. We're not going to stop the fight but- and at the same time we're going to continue to work with our allies to establish that safe zone between Kurdish Syria and Turkey that the president had myself and Secretary of State Pompeo negotiate in Ankara just a week ago. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do I understand what you're saying is that the number of U.S. troops remaining in Syria is still being determined? You haven't locked in at a number yet? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, we have- we have troops at Al-Tanf and then also the president's made it clear that we're going to have forces to secure the oilfields in northern Syria in order to then create a collaborative relationship on that basis-- MARGARET BRENNAN: More than 200 roughly? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --with Kurdish- with our Kurdish Syrian allies. I mean look- this is- this- this operation last night though was a real testament to the relationships that we've forged with Syrian Democratic Forces, who I can't detail, but played a role in this in terms of information that we were provided. Turkey's cooperation during the assault last night was acknowledged-- MARGARET BRENNAN: By opening its airspace? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --today by the president. Well, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Fully cooperating with the deployment of Special Forces, but really all the credit goes here to the decisiveness of this commander in chief and to the courage and professionalism of the Special Forces of the United States that- it was a- we- we were literally watching, MARGARET, in real time as those helicopters set down, as they assaulted the compound. And we- and we heard those words that- that al-Baghdadi had been killed. And I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --I knew from that moment America was safer as a result. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Vice President, I also want to ask you while you're here, you have been clear in saying there was no pressure put on Ukraine, no-- VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --quid pro quo as it pertains to what is now being looked at as grounds for potential impeachment of the president. But we have had at least four U.S. officials under oath, say that they had knowledge of a deal being offered, that main military aid and a meeting with the president contingent on opening an investigation that relates to the company Joe Biden's son served on the board of. Are they all lying? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I can only tell you what I know. And what I know is that the transcript of the president's call with President Zelensky shows that there was no quid pro quo. He did nothing wrong. MARAGARET BRENNAN: But were you aware of-- VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I - I -- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that deal that-- VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: -- can honestly-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --they are-- VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: No-- MARGARET BRENNAN -- giving--- VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --I can also tell you that-- MARAGARET BRENNAN: details of and sworn under oath existed? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: -- that all of my interactions with President Zelensky, we focused entirely on President Zelensky's agenda to bring about reforms to end corruption in Ukraine and to bring together the European community to provide greater support for Ukraine. President Zelensky said there was no pressure. We had a good meeting when the president had to cancel to stay home for a hurricane and I met President Zelensky. The aid was released after that meeting and- but at the end-- MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 But did you have the knowledge of the deal that these U.S. officials have described under oath?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: What I can tell you is all of my interaction on this issue with the president of the United States and President Zelensky focused entirely on three things: number one, the United States of America's support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion of Crimea and- and the war that Russia-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: -- has been fomenting there. We actually-\u00a0 this administration different from the last one have provided lethal weapons for Ukraine-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but that- that conflict never came up--\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: -- and we've stood with them.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: -- in the phone call-- \u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Margaret we've stood with them--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: -- these officials - did- did have knowledge of what they're describing or no?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: We stood with them- we stood with them to restore their sovereignty and territorial integrity. Number two: President Zelensky was elected in a historic landslide and won parliamentary elections on an agenda to end corruption in Ukraine. And we very much wanted to understand the progress he was making on that. And thirdly, President Trump believed that it was time for the European community to step up. Those are the issues we made clear to President Zelensky and Ukraine.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yea.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: And I think as the- as the facts continue to come out the American people again will see there in the President's transcript, my interactions, there was no quid pro quo. There was no pressure. It was entirely focused on issues-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I haven't gotten a clear answer-- VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Of importance to the American people.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: -- from you on that though, sir. I do have to leave the interview there. But are you saying that you did not ever hear of such a deal? Is that what I understand you're describing? VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I- I- I'm telling you that all of my interactions with the president, all of my conversations with President Zelensky, were entirely focused on issues of importance to the American people, ending corruption, enlisting more European support-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: -- and supporting Ukraine in a way that would restore its territorial integrity and stand by Ukraine for its sovereignty. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right Mr. Vice President, thank you very much. I appreciate you joining us-- VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you Margaret. Great day for America.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in one minute with former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Susan Rice.",

And this is FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan. And there is breaking news this morning in the war against ISIS, and it's a blockbuster.\u00a0 Just a very short time ago, President Trump announced that the U.S. had conducted a special operations mission that killed the senior leader of the terrorist group the Islamic State or ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Last night the United States brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Trump detailed the raid and al-Baghdadi's death in graphic terms.\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I got to watch much of it. He died after running into a dead end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way. He had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast, but test results gave certain, immediate, and totally positive identification. It was him.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And Vice President Pence is on his way here from an interview across the street. He will be speaking with us, but while we wait we are lucky to be able to turn now to CBS News national security correspondent David Martin. You are here, David, listening with me to the President describe in--\u00a0 DAVID MARTIN (CBS News National Security Correspondent/@DavidMartin): Yeah.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --longer than forty-five minutes in graphic detail this raid. He said he was watching it from the Situation Room happen. What stood out to you?\u00a0 DAVID MARTIN: Well, first place, we should say one of the headlines is no U.S. casualties, except the dog who he described went into the-- the tunnel after Baghdadi and was injured by the blast when Baghdadi set off his suicide vest. And then the question was, well, if somebody is going to blow themselves up, how do you identify the remains? He-- he said that they had DNA samples with them and were able to make a match within fifteen minutes of Baghdadi blowing himself up, and then they collected all the body parts and brought them out with them along with some unspecified number of prisoners who had surrendered. And he gave some idea of-- of the scope of this operation. He-- he said, it all-- all told, it took about four and a half hours, an hour and ten minutes in, two hours on the ground, an hour and ten minutes out.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We don't know where it was launched from.\u00a0 DAVID MARTIN: We don't. We're going to have to do some backtracking to see where you can get from in an hour in-- and ten minutes. But this was a large force, eight helicopters to just put it in perspective. The-- the force that went into Bin Laden's compound two helicopters, twenty-five Navy SEALs. They had some others in reserve, but this-- this sounds like it was a bigger operation and one which had been in the works for a number of weeks. He said they-- they had somehow found out his travel schedule but that one of Baghdadi's security procedures is to change his mind about where he is going next at the last minute. But he went to this one place, and he-- the President said they were able to confirm that he was there, gave the launch, and it-- he said it took off shortly after 5:00 PM yesterday evening.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And the President was narrating it in such detail it was almost movie like in his description.\u00a0 DAVID MARTIN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But as he described Baghdadi, he-- he talked about the others in the room, including many new members of his national security team. He also did acknowledge Gina Haspel, the CIA director, who was key to-- to so much of this. You've learned it was Delta Force commandoes who carried this out.\u00a0 DAVID MARTIN: That's what I have been told, Delta Forces.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: The President didn't reveal that detail in his remarks.\u00a0 DAVID MARTIN: The Army equivalent of-- of the Navy SEALs. And I would-- just from listening to that description, I haven't had anybody tell me this, I would imagine they-- they-- there was a small group of Delta Force that would go into the compound, the compound would be surrounded by a larger group of probably Army Rangers providing security--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 DAVID MARTIN: --to keep anybody from coming to the compound.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: David Martin, you have some busy reporting ahead of you. Thank you very much for joining us.\u00a0 And we do want to take a closer look at Abu Bakr Baghdadi, who he was, why he was such a high-value target. He was not only the leader of ISIS, but he was blamed for inspiring this terrorist movement that really found followers all around the world. Foreign correspondent Holly Williams has more on who he was.\u00a0 (Begin VT)\u00a0 (Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi speaking foreign language)\u00a0 HOLLY WILLIAMS (CBS News Foreign Correspondent/@HollyMAWilliams): He proclaimed himself the Caliph or leader of a so-called Islamic State, but in reality Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was a hate preacher who presided over a death cult of utter barbarity. With a twenty-five-million-dollar reward offered by the U.S., he was rarely captured on camera. This video released in April was his first appearance in five years and, apparently, his last. It's thought he was born in Iraq in 1971. After the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Baghdadi was detained in a prison camp that became an incubator for jihadis. When he was released, he joined al Qaeda's offshoot in Iraq, rising to become its leader. He later moved into the chaos of Syria's Civil War and split from al Qaeda. At its peak, ISIS ruled over an estimated ten million people in Iraq and Syria. The loss of their last group of territory in March, and now Baghdadi won't be the end of their ideology.\u00a0 (End VT)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's CBS news foreign correspondent Holly Williams who now joins us from Istanbul, Turkey, this morning. Holly, the President described Baghdadi as the number-one terrorist in the world. Does removing him from the battlefield actually kill ISIS itself?\u00a0 HOLLY WILLIAMS: No. It won't, Margaret. I mean, for ISIS, this is a very significant and symbolic loss of their so-called Caliph. And, of course, it shows that the U.S. will spare no effort in hunting down the leaders of terrorist organizations. But, in the end, ISIS is not about one man. It's the expression of an ideology. It's not the first terrorist group of this type; and it certainly won't be the last. Al-Baghdadi and ISIS did distinguish themselves, if you will, by being particularly bloodthirsty and also by actually setting up a so-called Caliphate, by seizing land and territory, holding on to it for a while, and implementing their version of Islamic law. With other jihadist groups, when they have lost their leaders, we have seen them very quickly replace them. And I think that we will see that happen here. One potential successor is a character named Abu Abdullah Qardash. Like Abu Bakr al-Bagh--Baghdadi, he is, apparently, from Iraq and, apparently, spent time in a prison camp following the U.S. invasion in 2003.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Holly, he is--as you say--a symbolic loss. But since you spent so much time on the ground inside of Syria, what is the state of ISIS today?\u00a0 HOLLY WILLIAMS: Well, Margaret, you heard President Trump say just then, quote, \"we obliterated his Caliphate.\" And that's true in the sense that ISIS lost its last remaining (INDISTINCT) of territory back in March, but the Pentagon's own watchdog said in August that ISIS still has between fourteen and eighteen thousand members in Iraq and Syria, and Kurdish forces in Eastern Syria are holding, they say, around twelve thousand accused ISIS fighters in their prisons. The fear there is a mass escape. We spoke with a U.S. general in Syria just last month-- last month, and he described those prisoners as a, quote, \"contained fighting force.\" So, yes, ISIS has lost all of its territory now in Syria and Iraq. But, no, it is not a spent force.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Holly Williams there reporting from Istanbul. Thank you.\u00a0 And joining us now here in studio with more details of the raid is Vice President Mike Pence. Good morning to you, Mister Vice President.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You were in the Situation Room watching this--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: I was.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --as it happened.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: I was.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell me about the decision behind-- when was it made? Who made it?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: Well, first let me just say this is a great day for America. Al-Baghdadi, the most wanted man in the world, is dead. And it's a tribute to the courage of our Armed Forces, Special Forces that executed the raid on the compound last night, but it's also a tribute to the decisiveness of President Donald Trump. We first received information early in the week about the possibility of his location--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: This was CIA?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: It was through our intelligence agencies that the President rightly commended today. Through a combination of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance we believe we knew where he would be. And by Thursday afternoon, the President and I were informed that there was a high probability he would be at the compound in Idlib province. The President immediately directed our commanders to develop military options. Those were presented to the President at the White House on Friday morning. But it was Saturday morning that we received the actionable intelligence that allowed the decision that the President had made to move forward to happen. And it is a-- and it was incredible to be in the Situation Room and to see this unfold in real time--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --as our Special Forces were on the ground, to see their professionalism over a period of two hours. But the wor-- America and the world are safer today with the leader of ISIS dead.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: According to U.S. intelligence, though, ISIS has about eight branches. It-- it had that--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --battleground it's lost in Iraq and Syria, but it has, as you know, a significant force in Afghanistan and inspiration all around the world. So what impact will taking out Baghdadi have on the rest of those tentacles?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: Well, as the President said today what-- what the United States of America demonstrated last night is that this President, this country will be unrelenting in our fight against ISIS or any terrorist organization that threatens this country.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But what does that mean for the drawdown of U.S. forces from Syria? Does that mean that Iraq has agreed to now host the majority of the presence being pulled out from Syria?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: Well, we-- we have a military presence in Iraq. We have as the President's made clear an ongoing military presence in parts of Syria. But-- but to be clear you-- you know the President looked at the deployment of American forces in between traditionally Kurdish Syria and the Turkish border and, essentially, believed that that was not the right place for our forces to be. American forces went into Syria, worked with our Syrian Kurdish allies to destroy the ISIS caliphate.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: The last inch of territory the ISIS caliphate was captured in March. And the President looked at the circumstances where we had American forces, essentially, providing a safe zone patrol on the Turkish border. That was not the mission.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So how many--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: I have to tell you--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --are staying?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: I have to tell you as the-- as the father of a United States Marine, I-- I couldn't be more grateful that we have a commander-in-chief that is always asking about-- about you know whether or not American forces have to be in harm's way.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: And if they're not on the mission-- they weren't on the mission. ISIS, the caliphate, had been destroyed so the President said we'll bring them home. But last night, the President of the United States proved to the world--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --that our fight against ISIS is unrelenting. And by-- and by killing the leader of ISIS--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --the active operational leader of ISIS, who it was reported just two weeks ago was giving orders to ISIS fighters in Syria, we believe we will have a measurable impact on the effectiveness of that terrorist organization. But we're not going to let up. We're not going to stop the fight but-- and-- and at the same time we're going to continue to work with our allies to establish that safe zone between--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --Kurdish Syria and Turkey that the President had myself and Secretary of State Pompeo negotiate in Ankara just a week ago.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But do I understand what you're saying is that the number of U.S. troops remaining in Syria is still being determined? You haven't locked in at a number, yet?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: Well, we have-- we have troops at Al-Tanf and then also the President's made it clear that we are going to have forces to secure the oilfields in northern Syria in order to then create a collaborative relationship on that basis--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: More than two hundred, roughly?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --with Kurdish-- with our Kurdish Syrian allies. I mean look-- this is-- this-- this operation last night, though, was a real testament--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --to the relationships that we've forged with Syrian Democratic Forces, who I can't detail, but played a role in this in terms of information that we were provided. Turkey's cooperation during the assault last night was acknowledged--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: By opening its airspace?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --today by the President. Well, yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: Fully cooperating with the deployment of Special Forces, but really all the credit goes here to the decisiveness of this commander-in-chief and to the courage and professionalism of the Special Forces of the United States that-- it was a-- we-- we were literally, watching, Margaret, in real time--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --as those helicopters set down, as they assaulted the compound. And we-- and we heard those words that-- that al-Baghdadi had been killed. And I--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --I knew from that moment America was safer as a result.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Vice President, I also want to ask you while you are here, you have been clear in saying there was no pressure put on Ukraine, no--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --quid pro quo as it pertains to what is now being looked at as grounds for potential impeachment of the President. But we have had at least four U.S. officials, under oath, say that they had knowledge of a deal being offered, that main military aid and a meeting with the President contingent on opening an investigation that relates to the company Joe Biden's son served on the board of. Are they all lying?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: Well, I can only tell you what I know. And what I know is that the transcript of the President's call with President Zelensky shows that there was no quid pro quo. He did nothing wrong.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But were you aware of--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: I-- I --\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that deal that--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --can honestly--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --they are--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: No--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN -- giving---\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --I can also tell you that--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --details of and sworn under oath existed?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --that in all of my interactions with President Zelensky, we focused entirely on President Zelensky's agenda to bring about reforms to end corruption in Ukraine and to bring together the European community to provide greater support for Ukraine.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: President Zelensky said there was no pressure. We had a good meeting when the President had to cancel to stay home for a hurricane and I met President Zelensky. The aid was released after that meeting and-- but at the end--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But did you have the knowledge of the deal that these U.S. officials have described under oath?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: What I can tell you is all of my interaction on this issue with the President of the United States and President Zelensky focused entirely on three things: number one, the United States of America's support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion of Crimea and-- and the war that Russia--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. \u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --has been fomenting there. We actually-- this administration different from the last one have provided lethal weapons for Ukraine--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but that-- that conflict never came up--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: -- and we've stood with them.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --in the phone call--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: Margaret, we've stood with them--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --these officials-- did-- did you have knowledge of what they're describing or no?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: We stood with them-- we stood with them to restore their sovereignty and territorial integrity. Number two: President Zelensky was elected in a historic landslide--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --and won parliamentary elections on an agenda to end corruption in Ukraine. And we very much wanted to understand the progress he was making on that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: And, thirdly, President Trump believed that it was time for the European community to step up. Those are the issues we made clear to President Zelensky and Ukraine. And I think as the-- as the facts continue to come out the American people again will see there in the President's transcript, my interactions, there was no quid pro quo. There was no pressure.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: It was entirely focused on issues--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I haven't gotten a clear answer--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: --of importance to the American people.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --from you on that though, Sir. I do have to leave the interview there. But are you saying that you did not ever hear of such a deal? Is that what I understand you are describing?\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: I-- I-- I'm telling you that all of my interactions with the President, all of my conversations with President Zelensky, were entirely focused on issues of importance to the American people, ending corruption, enlisting more European support--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: -- and supporting Ukraine in a way that would restore its territorial integrity and stand by Ukraine for its sovereignty.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Mister Vice President, thank you very much. I appreciate you joining us--\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: Thank you, Margaret. Great day for America.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in one minute with former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Susan Rice.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We are back now with President Obama's former national security adviser and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. She had planned to join us to discuss her new book Tough Love: My Story of the Things worth Fighting For. We do hope to get to that as well, but it is just such tremendous news this morning. Madam Ambassador, thank you for joining us. You were part of the administration at the moment the U.S. first took military action against ISIS. What is your reaction to the death of al-Baghdadi?\u00a0 SUSAN RICE (Former National Security Adviser/@AmbassadorRice): Well, obviously, it's a major milestone and it's one that we all should be welcoming quite plainly. But it doesn't mean that the fight against ISIS is over. And it doesn't mean that we can declare mission accomplished and-- and just walk away. What we've seen time and time again in this part of the world is that when the pressure is relieved on terrorist organizations, whether al-Qaeda or ISIS, they are able to reconstitute. So we need to be vigilant. We need to maintain a-- a minimal presence in order to ensure that the pressure stays on ISIS and they don't come back roaring.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: It is pouring rain out there. Right behind you just for--\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: I was standing in the pouring rain--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You were-- you were--\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: --just a second ago. Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I-- I appreciate your bravery through that coming out on the-- we're on the roof of a-- of Jones Day here in Washington bringing you FACE THE NATION. But back to the issue at hand. Do-- do you know was-- was President Obama informed of the death of al-Baghdadi by the administration? Did you know--\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: I-- I--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --before the news today?\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: No. There's no reason why I should know. There is a tradition of common courtesy of Presidents informing their predecessors of things of significance like this. Since the White House, seemingly, didn't feel it necessary to inform the leadership of the intelligence committees on a bipartisan basis, I am quite confident that they didn't do the normal protocol with respect to predecessors either.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and during the Obama administration when say--\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: We typically tried to do that--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --Osama bin Laden was--\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: --we typically tried to do that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --taken off the battlefield--\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: As a matter of courtesy.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: As a matter of courtesy. Well, you write in-- in your book about the rise of ISIS and that in 2014 when they took the city of Mosul in Iraq that it took the intelligence community by surprise. It took policymakers by surprise. There was underestimation of how weak the Iraqi government was and just that ISIS could use the battlefield the way they did--as effectively as they did. Are you saying you see the risk now with the drawback in Syria that it appears is still happening, of creating the same kind of vacuum?\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: We've learned in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and now in Syria repeatedly that you can't take the pressure off and expect these groups not to reconstitute. They may come back with a different name and a different leader but the ideology remains and the ambition remains. And so, yes, I think it's very concerning that President Trump made the decision a couple of weeks ago to withdraw our forces from northern Syria, leave the Kurds exposed, essentially, enable the Turks to come in from the north and wipe them out of their traditional homeland and the Russians to come up from the south and claim territory that had been denied to them by our president's-- by our presence and by that of the Kurds. I think this is still very dangerous. We have ISIS that can come back even with new leadership. We have over a hundred ISIS prisoners already that have escaped according to the secretary of defense. And this has been a decision that, seemingly, was taken without consultation by the President with his closest advisors. And it's been hugely beneficial--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: --not only to ISIS but also to Russia, Iran, and of course Assad as well as Turkey.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I was pressing the vice president for some details on those number of forces being left in Syria because it doesn't seem we have that kind of granular decision making just yet--\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: And, Margaret, just this notion that somehow we're moving a handful of forces out of Syria to-- to be able to send them home-- do-- do the American people understand that since May, President Trump has deployed fourteen thousand additional U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: At a time when he's saying he wants to take the United States out of the Middle East? This is not-- this is not on the level.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something you write about in the book. You know the public may remember in the wake of the attacks in Benghazi, that you were the person put forward by the Obama administration to explain what happened. The information--\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: On that first Sunday, yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: On that first Sunday on shows like this one. And you say, obviously, that had tremendous political blowback for you, professor-- professional, but you reveal for the first time some really personal blowback.\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: Yeah. I--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Your daughter--\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: Well, I--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --had to seek medical help because of what happened.\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: I-- I describe in the book how my nine-year-old daughter at the time, after some weeks of this, you know, very public and sustained pillorying of me, started having what can only be described as hallucinations. And, of course, her father and I were terrified. She was seeing men coming out of walls at her. We took her to-- to be evaluated. The doctors at Children's Hospital here in Washington were looking at, you know, is this psychosis?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: Is it brain tumor? Is it schizophrenia? Is it a vision problem? And they, thankfully, after several weeks were able to rule all of that out--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: --and determine that it was a stress reaction to hearing through the television what I was enduring.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a lot of those--\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: And so I wrote that, Margaret, because I want people to understand that these things have--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: --real consequences for those who don't sign up for this.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Those personal details in your book that we mentioned--we have to leave it there, and we'll be right back.\u00a0 SUSAN RICE: Thank you.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: This past week the parade of witnesses for Democrats' impeachment investigation continued, picking up momentum with some key testimony from State Department officials.\u00a0 REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Ambassador Bill Taylor testified and gave the most sweeping and devastating testimony about President Trump's efforts to shake down the Ukrainian government.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That was Democrat Jamie Raskin. Taylor's testimony was explosive, implicating President Trump as being part of an effort to withhold a meeting and military aid to Ukraine until President Zelensky would announce an investigation into former Vice President Biden's son and his business dealings in Ukraine. President Trump urged Republicans to get tougher and praise Democrats, saying--\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They stick together and they're vicious. They don't have a Mitt Romney in their midst.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to former Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy. He used to lead the main investigative committee in the House of Representatives and he joins us this morning from Greenville, South Carolina. Good to have you back on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY (Former Congressman, R-South Carolina/@TGowdySC): Yes, Ma'am. Thank you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You told me earlier that you had agreed to work for the White House earlier this month as outside counsel for the President on the impeachment proceeding but you didn't. And that's because, as you describe it, a restriction on former members of Congress in terms of communicating with an intent to influence for about a year after leaving office. So--\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: Yes, Ma'am.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --when that year ends, will you be joining the White House fight?\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: I have no idea. I don't represent the President as of today. I don't know what if anything will exist in January. It may be over. My sense is the President needs folks that can-- that can represent him now before the House, the Senate and-- and indirectly through television shows and print media. For one year I can't talk to the House or Senate and my reading of that statute, and it's a restrictive reading I'll grant you, but my reading is I can't even communicate indirectly on behalf of a person with the intent to persuade. So I could not come on your show and give advice to House Republicans or House Democrats on how they ought to run their investigation if I were working for the President. So I don't even know if I'll be alive in January. If Dallas doesn't start playing better, I won't be alive in January. So, I don't know what-- who I'll be representing.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it surprised a lot of people to hear you'd be thinking of coming back to Washington. You used to tell us on FACE THE NATION you were so sick and tired of politics here you wanted to go back home and you were going to dive into one of the most divisive vitriolic arguments that could be had.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: Yeah, my wife asked me a lot of those same questions. To me impeachment is the political death penalty, Margaret.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So--\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: There's a reason our country has never removed anyone from office. So, I look at it as a lawyer. What process is entitled--is someone entitled to if you are seeking to remove him or her from office--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: --and assign to them a stigma that will echo through the halls of history?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: How much process is due?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you-- you're talking about process there and that's very specific here in terms of some of the criticisms from Republicans of this Democrat-led investigation. You said to me on this program in April in 2018 the following:\u00a0 TREY GOWDY (July 15, 2018): Well, our-- our private hearing was much more constructive than the public hearing. I mean public hearings are a circus, Margaret. I mean, that's why I don't like to do them. I don't do many of them. I mean there-- it's a freak show.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you still believe that?\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: One hundred percent.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So these hearings--\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: I-- I-- I have always said--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --should remain-- these depositions should remain private?\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: Well, you can't pick and choose which aspects of due process you're going to use. It's not just the privacy. I mean, the reason we respect executive branch investigations isn't because they are behind closed doors, it's because there are no leaks. I mean, John Durham-you have no idea what John Durham has been doing. You have no idea what Michael Horowitz is going to say in his Pfizer report. There were no leaks with Bob Mueller. You contrast that with the fact that Adam Schiff has had more press conferences this weekend than those three men have had in their lives. He uses an opening statement to give a parody. He lies about a whistleblower.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: So, yes, I prefer executive branch investigations because they are fact-centric, because you wait until the end to draw conclusions, and because there are no leaks. So I do understand the Republican frustration with the current investigation. My bias has always been towards investigations that wait until the end before they share their conclusions. It's just not fair to do it on an hour-by-hour basis. I-- I-- one other point, Margaret: there's a reason in courtrooms, the judge tells the jury, you can't even begin to make up your mind until the last witness has testified--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: --and the last piece of evidence has been introduced. I mean if it's good enough for the justice system, why should it not also be good enough for the political system?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in other words, the storming of the classified area by some Republicans was a bit of a political stunt and you think that what is being revealed behind closed doors should be heard out before judgments are made on whether or not the President should be impeached?\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: I think two things: I'm a rule follower. I threw a Republican out of a hearing because he was not a member of-- of the committee. I didn't take pictures on the House floor, even though, I was in the minority. I am a rule follower. So I think if you're going to have private investigations with unlimited time for questioning and cross examining witnesses, that's a good thing. What's not a good thing is to have selective leaks where you pick one sentence out of an eight-hour deposition, run to a bank of microphones and try to-- try to prejudice the outcome of the investigation. Again, Horowitz doesn't do it. Durham doesn't do it. Mueller didn't do it. All three of those investigations we have respect for.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking--\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: I don't--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --about Justice Department investigations versus the political process of impeachment?\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, Ma'am.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to the political process here with impeachment and those depositions behind closed doors and about forty-seven Republicans are permitted to be in there for those depositions alongside Democrats, who are the majority, of course. We heard something this week that was viewed as pretty significant from Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine. He was about the fourth U.S. official to substantiate in his detail, he said from notes, that \"President Trump's aid to Ukraine and his conversation with the President, all of this was predicated on the investigations of Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company Hunter Biden served on the board of,\" and \"alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.\" Those are two quotes. Does that sound appropriate to you?\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: Well, let's take them separately. Is it an impeachable offense to condition aid on cooperating with the 2016 election investigation? I mean are we going to remove a President from office if he conditioned aid on figuring out who tried to interfere in our 2016 election--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Congress gets to decide--\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: I don't think so.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --what an impeachable offense is. But conditioning sounds a lot--\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: They do?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --like quid pro quo.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: Well, you know, that means something for something. I need to know what both of those somethings is. If the something is we're not going to give you aid until you help us figure out who tried to interfere with-- with the levers of democracy in 2016. Margaret, I can tell you if-- if a Democrat did that, we'd be adding something to Mount Rushmore. I mean we spent two years as a country trying to figure out--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: --who tried to interfere with our elections. So, clearly, it can't be an impeachable offense. It can't be an impeachable offense to ask for the server because Jim Comey wanted the server, so--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're-- you're--\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: --I need to know--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. Just to--\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: --what's the something.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --to be clear on the server--\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: Sorry.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --you are talking about the Democratic National Committee's computer server. Are you saying it's hidden in Ukraine?\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: I have no idea.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: I have no clue--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That-- the President has said that.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: --part of the limitation--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it-- it-- it's a--\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: Well, I-- I--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --theory that's been debunked.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: Well, this is the theory that has not been debunked. Jim but-- Jim Comey wanted the server. I don't think it's an impeachable offense for Bill Barr to also want the server. I don't have any idea where it is, but I don't think it's an impeachable offense to say, if you know where it is, would you mind telling us? Keep in mind that is the server the Russians hacked to gain access to e-mails. There was a point--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: --in time where we all wanted to know about that. So, what is the statute of limitations on interfering with our 2016 election? I don't know. As for the rest of Taylor, I've read his-- his opening--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: --statement, Margaret, but-- but I-- I would need to follow up with questions.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: I would be-- I-- I'd need to also watch what other members ask--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: --and-- and-- and, significantly, what the cross-examination would have looked like before I can draw any conclusions.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Trey Gowdy, thank you for your time today.\u00a0 TREY GOWDY: Yes, Ma'am.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back on this busy day with Senator Amy Klobuchar.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by Minnesota senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar. Good morning to you, Senator.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minnesota/Democratic Presidential Candidate/@amyklobuchar): Good morning. Thanks for having me on, Margaret.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks for braving the rain today. I want to ask you, of course, about the news of the day. The death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, this was the takedown of a very, very dangerous terrorist. And so we have to take this moment to thank those that put themselves in danger. The decision was a good one and this is a guy that was responsible for the deaths of so many-- so many Americans, so many innocent people. But as Susan Rice just said a few minutes ago, this doesn't mean that ISIS isn't still there.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: We still have, of course, over a hundred of the ISIS fighters that the defense secretary has said got out recently of their confinement and then we have others that are in a prison, and it's unclear who is going to be guarding that prison. So there are problems not just in Syria, but all over the world and that's what concerns me overall about this President's decision making and about what he has done in terms of breaking down our alliances, leaving the Kurds--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: --who gave us intelligence for this operation, leaving them for slaughter.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you rightly thank the U.S. military and intelligence for this. President Trump signed off on this raid.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, he did.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is a political win for him--\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You are trying to run against him--\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --to become the next Commander-in-Chief.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yeah.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't this going to make it harder to run against him when he can say he is the guy who got Baghdadi?\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Look, I have in the past, for instance, when the President made the decision to respond to Assad's use of sarin gas, I commended him for that decision. But just because you make some decisions, and you must as a Commander-in-Chief and you must make those decisions for the security of this country, doesn't mean that his foreign policy overall has not been a disaster. The decision to get out of the Iranian agreement, the nuclear agreement, which has allowed Iran to now bust the caps to enrich uranium. The decision to get out of the Russian nuclear weapons agreement.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: The decision to get out of the climate change agreement at a time when our world is warming, sea levels are rising, and we're seeing floods and fires all over the world.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So that--\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Those were very bad decisions.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So unlike other Democratic candidates, would you pledge to keep a U.S. military presence in Syria?\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I would not have removed those one hundred fifty troops. I would not have done it. I would not have given in to Erdogan--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you keep them?\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: --when he called. Yeah, I would have kept them there.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So--\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: And I would have-- this would never have happened. But now this damage has been done. So the question is what do you do now? Well, you keep trying to use your leverage to do everything to defeat ISIS and you try to do all you can for humanitarian aid and you certainly try to use the leverage that we have remaining to help the Kurds.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, meaning you have some oversight there of the Justice Department. Do you think those ISIS leaders, who are responsible for the deaths of Americans, all should be extradited for prosecution here to the United States?\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yes. I think that we should go after those leaders. But the point of this is not really, exactly what we're going to do now. The question is what do we do going forward when the American people have a decision to make? Do they want to--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: --keep a President and that has been so divisive in this moment where this morning we are unified behind getting rid of terrorists, that's for sure, but every morning probably tomorrow and the next day he wakes up and he starts going after immigrants, going after people of color, dividing people and then not having people's back when it comes to bringing down pharmaceutical prices or--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: --doing something about infrastructure or doing something to help our farmers who his trade war has left devastated in so many parts of the country. So I think the American people can come together say, yes, we want to defeat a terrorist.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But then they look at what he does every single day to this country and they want new leadership.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You have criticized some of your fellow Democrats also running for the nomination for overpromising in terms of providing free services like free college education and the like. But you are now offering two-year college and technical schools.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yeah.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to pay for that and who gets hit with the tax?\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yeah.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: If there is one.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: So, I have always supported that. Those are the fastest rising degrees right now in terms of the number of jobs we're going to have. Seventy-four thousand openings for electricians. Nearly that many for plumbers, for medical tech people, for home care workers--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But what is the cost to that?\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: -- that is where this is. The cost of this-- my education plan is costs approximately five hundred billion dollars. And I would pay for it by taking the capital gains rate, which been a rip off for average Americans, and changing that to the personal income rate. I have shown everything, Margaret, how I am going to pay for it because I think we've got a President that has added up debt, trillions of dollars, hasn't shown. I want to make college more affordable, double the Pell Grants, and do this in a smart way instead of paying for rich kids to go to college, which is sadly--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if--\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: -- what my opponent's plans to.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So if you make about four hundred thousand dollars a year or so your taxes are going to go up, is that correct?\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: For people under my plan? Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Quickly on impeachment: you believe that the whistleblower should testify, is that correct?\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I think it would be good to have the whistleblower testify. I don't know that it is necessary to have the whistleblower testify, because we have people like Ambassador Taylor that have come forward with first-hand knowledge. The whistleblower was simply reporting on something--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: --that he had heard from others. I think what's most important, is to keep getting the testimony of people that were actually there on the scene. That Ambassador Taylor testimony was devastating. It showed that this was not just one phone call, that this had been a plan for a long time, for the President to put the interests of America behind his own personal interests to get dirt on an opponent. It's a pattern. He does it for his business. He does it for his partisan interests. He does it every single day.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I know we have to leave it there, but I want to thank you for braving the weather. But, also, I know you had to be somewhere for a campaign event and you stayed around to-- to talk to us--\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, this is an important day.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --on this important day.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: So, thank you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you.\u00a0 And we will be right back in a moment.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: For more now on the impact of al-Baghdadi's death on the war on terror, we are joined now by retired Navy Admiral Sandy Winnefeld. He is a former vice chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a CBS News military and Homeland Security analyst. Also with us is former acting director of the CIA and CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell. Gentlemen, thank you both for being here.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL (Former CIA Deputy Director/@MichaelJMorell/CBS News Senior National Security Contributor): Welcome.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: It was extraordinary to hear the President for about forty-five minutes share in detail, blow by blow almost, what this raid looked like. Mike, I want to know from you, what stood out and is it dangerous to have so much revealed?\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So let-- I'll let Sandy answer the operational military question, but, to me, this is a great day. We should be really thankful that Baghdadi is gone, and, clearly, the intelligence community-- community and the U.S. military did an amazing job and the President made exactly the right decision.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And the President thanked Gina Haspel, the CIA director.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Absolutely. And I think we'll learn more in the days ahead about what the intelligence was and-- and how we got it and-- and-- and thank even more people. Bothered me a little bit some of what the President did in-- in-- in providing detail about taking back to the United States pieces of Baghdadi's body. It bothered me a little bit hearing the President talk about that-- some of that Syrian oil being ours, right, because that's what inspires-- that's what inspires some extremists. You know the-- the-- the oil comments, Margaret, really validate at least it sounds to people like it validates forty to fifty years of conspiracy theories about what American foreign policy is all about, right, and it's not. So a great, great day, but I think the President could have handled the-- the press conference a little bit better.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Sandy--\u00a0 ADMIRAL JAMES WINNEFELD (Retired) (Former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff): And, Margaret, we do these operations all the time. The difference this one is, of course, the prominence of the target. And you're always worried about operational security. We rarely have a problem before the raid from people working in the White House or elsewhere, because they know what the stakes are. They don't want anybody to get hurt. But after the-- after the raid, there's usually a race to the microphone because people want others to know that they had a hand in it and that sort of thing--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: The Obama administration was harshly criticized for oversharing after the death of Bin Laden.\u00a0 JAMES WINNEFELD: And so you want to be very careful with that. And-- and there are operational details that we protect, sensitive techniques and that sort of thing. Notwithstanding what Michael just said, I think from the operational side, I didn't really see anything that the President said that was of con-- concern to me. There is a lot of other things he could have said that might have been problematic.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to play a sound bite from some of what he shared when he addressed the nation from the diplomatic room earlier today.\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We were in the compound for approximately two hours, and after the mission was accomplished, we took highly sensitive material and information from the raid, much having to do with ISIS--origins, future plans, things that we very much want.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike, what are you looking for in that trove?\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: You're first looking for current plots, right? Is there anything that they're plotting today against any Western target or any target in Iraq, in Syria that we need to move to defend against. That's the first thing you're looking for. The second thing you're looking for is how is ISIS thinking about where it is today and what are its strategic plans and intentions. This is the second thing you're looking for. And I think the third thing you're looking for, particularly with regard to Baghdadi, is how involved was he in the day-to-day operations.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: How-- how involved was he?\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So we don't really know.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: But I would say this, when we-- when we went in to get Bin Laden, we didn't think he was involved in the day-to-day operations. When we brought all those materials back out of Abbottabad and went through them, we learned he was heavily involved in day-to-day operations. So you really don't know until you get your hands on that material and-- and be able to look at it.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: It was notable the vice president indicated that there was some direct knowledge of events from Baghdadi.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That stood out to me.\u00a0 JAMES WINNEFELD: And, Margaret, this is-- may answer a question some of your viewers have and that is, well, if you know where he is, why don't you just bomb him and kill him? Instead, we put people at risk to go on the ground, first of all, because we like to capture him if we can, but also this is a real treasure trove. And it will tell you not only about what Michael said but their networks, how they get their finances, how they communicate with each other. It's all very important at both a strategic, operational, and tactical level to get that sensitive site exploitation.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Now the-- the President said these were U.S. special forces. David Martin reported it was led by Delta Force in particular, but the President thanked a number of different countries. He repeatedly thanked Russia. He thanked Turkey for allowing use of its airspace. He also said that there was some Kurdish help as well. Did his detail and who he thanked stand out to you? Was that sort of standard?\u00a0 JAMES WINNEFELD: Actually, one of the complexities of these operations is that they do involve other countries. For example, if you are going to rescue a hostage, and that hostage has somebody with them who's from another country, you want to consult with that country. There are overflight rights, there are basing rights, and a number of other consideration. So I think it was actually appropriate in the wake of the operation for him to-- to thank some of those people. Some of those are characters we don't necessarily like very much, so that was a little concerning, but it was well done I thought.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: The Kurdish thank you stood out to me because it suggested to me that that's perhaps where the intelligence came from.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You had on this program before said you were concerned about losing some of that intelligence that might be getting shared. The President also said in his remarks that he planned or wanted to release some video of those last few moments of Baghdadi's life that he repeatedly characterized, called him a dog, whimpering, crying, he wanted ISIS' followers to see him like that.\u00a0 JAMES WINNEFELD: Margaret, this is piling on.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you advice this?\u00a0 JAMES WINNEFELD: This is piling on. This-- one of-- the one part of the President's remarks that did bother me was this continual piling on of humiliation, a little bit of that is appropriate, but you're sending a signal to some of his followers around the world that could cause them to lash out possibly more harshly in the wake of this.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: You don't want a locker room kind of feel to this, right? And that was the one thing we worked really hard on after the Bin Laden raid, is don't make those kind of statements because it does inspire other people.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You said, specifically, body parts stood out to you in terms of how the President described how they were handled. Can you describe or explain what you mean by that in terms of some of how this will resonate?\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So I think it's all right-- I think it's all right to say-- I think it's all right to say that we used, you know, DNA matching to figure out that it was him. But to actually talk about body parts and actually bringing them back with us, right, so that we have them here with us I think is going too far.\u00a0 JAMES WINNEFELD: And one of the things, Margaret, that is-- this fight is all about is religious freedom. It's about respect for other religions. And if you look back to the Bin Laden raid, as much as we--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 JAMES WINNEFELD: --detested that man and as much harm as he did to our nation, we treated his body with respect--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0 JAMES WINNEFELD: --that is due under Islam--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 JAMES WINNEFELD: --and this--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 JAMES WINNEFELD: --was a little bit tough.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much--\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Thank you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --gentlemen, for your analysis.\u00a0 We will be right back.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: On this historic day, we also want to remember the families of ISIS victims, James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller and the thousands whose names we don't know.

JAMES MATTIS CORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELL PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tMr. Secretary, welcome to \"Intelligence Matters.\" It is great to have you on the show, and it is great to talk to you again. \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tYeah, good morning to you, Michael. It was a pleasure serving alongside you. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo, sir, you recently published a book on leadership. It's called Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead. It's a terrific book. It chronicles your career and the lessons about leadership that you learned along the way. And I want to ask you a number of questions about that. But before we do that, I want to ask you a couple of other things, get your reaction to a couple of things. The first is your reaction to what's happened in Northern  Syria in the last couple of weeks. How do you think about that? \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tWell, the Syria situation has always been one of the most complex that I'd dealt with. I'd never seen anything with so many different motivations, so many different disparate groups, many at odds with each other, from great powers to local terrorists. \tSo it is a very frustrating environment; it's a chaotic environment. But I think we have to fall back to first principles as we look at it. And is the threat coming out of there a threat to the United States? And I agree with those who have assessed it to be a direct and an indirect threat to our country. \tAnd so we're going to have to remain engaged in this. It's not an endless war, but it's certainly been a long one. And there are times when you just want to throw up your hands in dismay and say, \"Let's walk away.\" But the fact is we've not been hit in the \u00a0 mainland by foreign terrorists who have sworn to hit us since 9/11. And that's in no small part due to the campaign we've run. So I believe that we have to remain engaged in the region with our allies and partners and continue to stand up for our interests. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tAnd so, when you say, \"direct threat and indirect threat,\" what are you talking about? \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tWell, these are people that have sworn that they are going to attack, whether it be characterizing us as the great Satan, or simply America, or simply our values of democracy as being anti their view of the world. The idea that they're just going to go away, I think, is very na\u00efve. \tI've dealt with them, as you know, Michael, since 1979 in one form or another. And I would not in any way patronize this enemy. We've seen the attacks in Europe, in Brussels, in Paris. We've seen where they've gotten through. And this is a direct threat to  what we stand for, to our people, to the safety of the democracies. And we're going to have to band together with like-minded nations, because no nation on its own can deal with this. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tYeah. Sir, you made some jokes over the weekend at the Al Smith dinner about the president. And I take it to mean that you're not going to change your approach here to talking about partisan politics. Correct?\u00a0 \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tI believe that military officers, active or retired, need to carry on with the tradition handed down from George Washington's day to George Marshall's day where we defend this experiment in democracy, but those of us who especially are referred to as \"general\" for the rest of our lives, whether we like it or not, have to be very careful about entering into political assessments of elected leaders. I don't believe that's the military's role in a democracy. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tAnd do you think that those folks who do that somehow put the Department of Defense and the U.S. Military at some risk and raise questions about whether they're political or not? Because I have the same sense about intelligence officials who speak out, that people will say, \"Geez, I wonder if the currently serving folks are as partisan.\" \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tWell, I think, and you look back through history, and you look at Praetorian guards and the role the military eventually comes to be so authoritative in certain times in history about who will be the political leaders, we should be remembering that the reason we have civilian control of the military is to avoid that. \tAnd if active duty officers are looked at askance by the political leaders because they're concerned with how these officers will, once they get out of the military, or intelligence officers get out of the intelligence services, how they will characterize \u00a0 private discussions in the messy world of trying to put together policy to deal with the challenges we face, I don't think that's helpful to the governance of the country. \tAnd I think the military needs to stay strictly apolitical. And, by the way, Michael, this is not just about me. My predecessor in office, Ash Carter, Secretary Carter, who was President Obama's last Secretary of Defense, would studiously avoid making political assessments, even to the point of telling congressmen and congresswomen that he would not answer a certain question because it was political. \tSo this is not just about me. This is not just about this administration. This is about a more than 200-year-old tradition that we do not make political assessments. We defend this country. We don't tell the American people how to vote or how they should consider political leaders who've been basically invested with the authority of the  Constitution. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tDo you, though, sir, worry about the state of our politics, not talking about one party or the other? Do you worry about the state of our politics and the impact that it's having on national security? \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tI worry a great deal about it. I have fewer concerns about our adversaries destroying this country than our ability to. And let me put this in context. Right now, I think that we are so divided, we're so corrosive in how we address certain issues, that we've forgotten we need to be hard on the issues.\u00a0 \tWe certainly should have spirited intellectual discussions about issues, from health care to national security. But we don't have to be hard on each other. And we've turned this into a very corrosive debate that does not allow compromise. Yet, our whole government was set up with three co-equal branches of government and a bicameral  legislature, to boot. Without compromise, you cannot govern the country. \tSo I understand, in an election, it's about dividing the country, \"Vote for me, not for you. I'm smart; he's dumb. She's wrong; I'm right,\" however you want to characterize it. Sometimes it's not very civil. Okay, I got it. We're in a democracy. Gets pretty raucous, especially in election time. \tBut when elections are over, when we're done with the dividing, and we've voted, then we need to govern. And that takes unity. That takes compromise. And it's as if we're in a constant election cycle now -- vice an election, and then we roll up our sleeves when it's over, and we work together, and we govern the country for the betterment of future generations. \tIt's as if we've forgotten that, and now we characterize our adversaries as eternally wrong, eternally evil, and not to be compromised with. Our adversaries  have got to be cheering as far as weakening ourselves as a country. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tYeah. I'm wondering, sir, as a historian and as a lover of history that you are, if you've seen a period of time in the past, either in U.S. history or in the history of other countries, that's similar to what's happening here and in Europe and in other developed countries, and if that history is instructive for us today in any way as we try to work our way through this. I know that's a tough question. \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tNo, it's an excellent question, I think, Michael, because you just brought up that this is not unique to our democracy right now. I mean, we're all watching what's going on in the U.K. with Brexit, in France, in Germany. And we've got to look at whether or not history gives us analogous situations, not that it's a perfect roadmap, but it's the only thing we have to light the path ahead. \tAnd, certainly, if you look at the United States going into the Civil War, you understand why Abraham Lincoln, in 1839, when he was only 29 years old, and I think, in his first recorded speech, said that he was less worried about falling from an external enemy than an internal. \tHe said that not all the armies of Europe and Asia and Africa combined with all the money in their world, even if they had Bonaparte for their leader, could cross the ocean, invade our country, cross the Blue Ridge Mountains and take a drink out of the Ohio River. \tBasically, he said that the bigger threat was internal division and what happens when people stop listening to one another, when they no longer believe in the wisdom of having good discussions and listening to each other and coming up with good policy. Rather, they believe only that they are right and \u00a0 everyone else is wrong. \tAnd so, as we look at this, and we watch what happened to our country in the Civil War, or we watch how other countries have fallen, one point comes through. And that is nations with allies thrive, and nations without allies die. Well, that's even true on a domestic plane. \tIf presidents don't have allies in the opposing party-- and all governments need some sort of a counter balance; it's good to have parties in this country-- but if you can't eventually work together, if you can't make allies and reach across the aisle, then a compromise-based government, like ours is that requires compromise, simply cannot stand. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tRight. \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tAnd this was a fear of the Founding Fathers. And it was a fear of young Abraham Lincoln. And he watched this unfold \u00a0 before his very eyes. And he was thrust into the position of having to save the Union. So this is not something that I would dismiss lightly based on what I've read in history. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tOkay, Mr. Secretary, let's chat about the book, which, again, I think is terrific, and I hope people go out and buy it. Let me ask you, why did you write it? What is the audience that it's aimed at? And what do you hope folks will learn from it? \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tWell, a couple impulses got me to write it. One was one of my mentors of many years reminded me when I got out that I'd been very fortunate to be often in positions where I could see big developments as they were initiated and as we went through their cycle of planning and execution. \tAnd he said, \"You know, you learned a lot from your reading. Maybe you'd think about writing what you learned down so that others can learn from what you  experienced.\" And I wasn't really eager to do it. I didn't see myself as a writer. But, at one point, I think I got weak-kneed, and I said, \"Okay, I'll do it.\" And, boy, did I learn how much work goes into writing a book and looking at a blank piece of paper and trying to figure out what can you put down that might help others. \tAnd that's the audience that I had to think about. And, certainly, it was young military leaders, NCOs, non-commissioned officers, sergeants, and lieutenants, captains and majors, colonels and generals. I had been very fortunate-- it wasn't just merit-- I just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and eventually worked my way through tactical or direct leadership, and then more or less executive and indirect leadership where you have layers between you and the others, and then, of course, strategic leadership at the top levels. \tAnd I learned things at each level that were probably not unique to me; but by putting them in the circumstance I was in, I thought it would help others to learn. And the audience would be the military guys, but I've been somewhat surprised at the number of business people who are referring to the book now. \tAnd I think it has to do with the takeaways from the book. I mean, some things are as simple as what we would call \"Leadership 101.\" I don't think anything in the book is so unique to me that I discovered it. All I did was employ it as we must as leaders, each of us in our own way. And I think that the takeaways are, number one, make sure your people know you care about them. People want to be part of something bigger. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tYes, yes. \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tBut they can't feel like they're part of something bigger in that  organization if your concern is external. You've got to be really concerned about how they're doing, their hopes, their dreams, especially when it's something like the military, where they're going to put their lives on the line. \tAnother point, though, as I went up higher, I really grew to understand why the Marine Corps, except in joint operations, combined operations with other services or other countries, doesn't use \"command and control.\" They use the words \"command and feedback.\" The Marines teach you to set a very clear strategy, or very clear aim for what you're doing. \tYou clarify and confirm it with your troops. You make certain they understand why they're doing it, what you want them to do. And you set up good feedback loops and data display loops. You get out and about. You talk to everybody, make sure they're on the same page. \tBut once they feel their ownership of the mission, take your hands off the steering wheel, and let them guide. Let them use their initiative and aggressiveness to carry out what you've put a lot of thought into defining is the mission. And as you do this, you're setting a culture of unity, a culture of teamwork. \tAnd, that way, you take advantage of everyone feeling a sense of ownership, but you're there to make certain they're ready, they're prepared for it, they're given all the support they need. And that allows for an awful lot of advantage accruing to your side. Because opportunities in the marketplace, opportunities on the football playing field, opportunities on the battlefield, they open and close very rapidly. \tAnd if you don't have people who are well-trained in the basics and understand your intent, then they won't take  advantage of those opportunities, Michael. And I think that I get an awful lot of credit for things that subordinates use in their initiative and aggressiveness carried out. And that was simply because I told them what needed to be done and I made sure they understood it, I clarified and confirmed it with them, and then basically unleashed their initiative. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tSo this focus on people which certainly resonates with me, is it the same across all three categories of leadership that you talked about, direct, executive, and strategic? Is that focus in all three of those areas and you're just implementing it in different ways? \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tI think that's a very fair way to characterize it. On the direct leadership level, you're reminded that the president of the United States, with the consent of Congress, can declare you an officer in the military; but only your subordinates, your troops, can declare you a leader. \tAnd what they're doing is they're determining whether or not you have their best interests at heart, whether or not you know what you're doing and are capable. And they're the ones who declare you a leader. And you're a leader because the whole system recognizes you can't do this on your own. \tNo general wins a battle on his own. So you've got to bring others along. And that same lesson practiced differently at the indirect level means you spend more time writing out what you want your troops to do. When you go from leading a platoon of 40 sailors and Marines and the infantry to leading 40,000 troops, you've got to write it down. \tAnd then you've got to go around and make very clear and answer questions about what it is you want to do, so the youngest sailors and Marines know it and understand it. Because they will surprise you with just how much they can do to carry out your \u00a0 mission if they really feel ownership of it, if you've been out there and explained what is going on and why. \tBut when you get to strategic leadership, that's where you have to be able to work, for example, with political leaders, like you and I did, Michael, people who were elected to office based on the aspirations of our people. And, yet, in many cases, you and I had to bring the grim polarities, the grim realities, so to speak, into those discussions about, \"I know you want to work on health care and education, but this is an enemy that means what they say. And we're going to have to stop them. And we're going to have to work with allies to do it.\" \tAnd as you address those polarities of human aspirations and of grim realities of true adversaries, whether you're FDR or you're any other president in our history, you have a very tough time reconciling that. And so, as a military or intelligence officer, or even  diplomatic officer, rises in rank in the U.S., this is where you go into the very messy business of setting priorities and policies and strategies. \tAnd it's fraught with tension. So many of the lessons you learn at the direct leadership level you have to adapt. But the fundamental lesson is that trust is the coin of the realm, whether with your 40-man platoon or when you're a commander, like I was, of U.S. Central Command, and walking into rooms where you have discuss joint efforts with kings or prime ministers or sultans or emirs or presidents. \tAnd you apply the lessons you learned differently, but you always try to find the common ground. And I used George Washington's approach to leading a revolutionary army. And it was very methodical. He believed in showing respect to others. He would listen and learn from them. \tHe would listen with an intent of really learning what they needed. Then he would help them. And then he would lead. So listen, learn, help, lead. And that process, applied differently at the direct level, the executive level, and the strategic level, served me pretty well once I'd done my study of how he'd done his job as a leader of the army. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tOne of the things that struck me, and I did not know this about you, but you served as a Marine recruiter at a pretty tough time, right? It was just in the aftermath of Vietnam. And I wonder what your pitch was then to why someone should become a United States Marine, and if your pitch today would be the same or any different. Or how do you think about that?\u00a0 \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tYeah, following the Vietnam War and we got rid of the draft in the country, which had motivated many of us to sign up in the first place, we had to find a way to recruit a volunteer force. And the quality of  people we needed meant that we would be competing with the civilian marketplace, with those who wanted to go to college first rather than go into the military initially. \tAnd, eventually, we had to go to Xerox Corporation, that taught us to do what's called a \"needs assessment.\" And we would lay out all sorts of different colored tags, basically. And it had to do with, \"Would you like 30 days paid vacation? Do you want health care?\" In another case, we put down, \"physical fitness, pride of belonging to the best,\" things like that. \tBut the idea was to get to know the people, and try to draw in people who would be very willing to embrace the Marine ethos of an elite fighting force. I don't think that's changed over many years. Now, how we convey it, we do more social media today. But the fundamental message is we're looking for young men and women patriots who are willing to look  beyond the hot political rhetoric and put their lives on the line to protect this experiment that you and I call America. \tAnd that remains the same. Because the Marines are a very young force. They like most of their force to be in and out in four years. And what we want are young people who will return to civilian society as better citizens. And so, when you look at the reason why they come in and what we want to return to the American society, is a citizen steeped in an understanding of how precious this freedom we have is, how precious and worth defending freedom really is, then I don't think the message has changed much over the centuries. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tJust a couple more questions on leadership, sir. You've mentioned Abraham Lincoln. You've mentioned George Washington. Is there a leader in history that you particularly admire, given all the history that you've read? \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tWell, there's quite a few, yeah. And, I mean, obviously, in history, Scipio Africanus is a great leader. I very much enjoy studying Mandela and the way he brought South Africa out of apartheid and then helped heal the country. Our own Americans, you've mentioned several of them there. \tBut let me mention three others. My first platoon sergeant was a corporal named Wayne Johnson. That's the senior enlisted man, supposed to be a staff sergeant, but in the post-Vietnam era, a lot of our NCOs had gotten out. And Corporal Wayne Johnson, of course, was immediately nicknamed John Wayne by his fellow sailors and Marines. But here was a young man, immigrant from the British West Indies. And he was the one who taught me how to be a lieutenant, basically, and how to be tough, but be tough for your troops, not on your troops.\u00a0 \tHe was replaced by Corporal Manuel Rivera, also an immigrant, from  Mexico. And Corporal Rivera was a very, very authoritative leader, NCO. There was no nonsense to him. And, yet, late at night, if we'd had trouble with a Marine during the day, I could see him off standing with him, talking with him, and coaching him. And I saw the influence he had and how he exercised leadership.\u00a0 \tAnd my third leader I admired greatly, my third platoon sergeant came from Quebec, Remy LeBrun. And he was a sort of coaching leader who was constantly alongside the troops, teaching them to shoot better, teaching them to run faster, teaching them to get over obstacles faster, talking to them about their home life. \tHe was like a father figure; and, yet, he was just harder than petrified woodpecker lips. (LAUGHTER) They all knew the toughest guy in the platoon was their coach. And so I learned a great deal from these young guys when I was a 21-year-old second lieutenant as these corporals and sergeants  basically taught me my job as an officer. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tMr. Secretary, maybe we can finish up in the last ten minutes or so here by talking about some national security threats and challenges facing our nation. And maybe I'll just throw out some issues and get you to react to them in terms of the threat or challenge that they pose to us. And maybe I'll start with maybe the toughest long-term challenge, which is China. How do you think about that? \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tWell, China is coming back into its own. But it's good to remember that, in the 250-year history of our country, we have only had adversarial relations with China between about 1947 and 1972. Now, it's becoming adversarial right now, as China has adopted some worrying practices. \tThey're shredding trust in the South China Sea by militarizing islands that have never been militarized in our  recent history, \"recent\" being several hundred years. They are using massive debt that they're piling on other countries, debt that those countries are not able to accommodate. And we've seen them taking part of Sri Lanka's port as collateral, for example, in exchange. \tBut when we see this ideological fight going on, when we see what's happening in Hong Kong, and the way they're trying to impose their authoritarian state model over people who do not want that model, when we watch their state-run capitalism basically not playing by the rules that came out after World War II about how we would have fair trade, when we see the coercion and intimidation they're applying there, in the South China Sea, and ignoring the international rules-based order, for example, the tribunal decision on who owns one of the island areas there, in the South China Sea-- and it ruled in favor of the Philippines-- when we see the pernicious theft of all the valuable  intellectual property that's going on that's orchestrated even by the government, we're going to have to figure out how China and the United States are going to manage their differences. \tWe have two nuclear-armed super powers, and we cannot have a lack of understanding between us. So I think we need to have more philosophical discussions with China, not just talking about South China Sea or North Korea or Hong Kong, the specific issues. We need to move it up to a strategic discussion about how are we going to get along in this world. \tAnd I don't see that happening right now. But we're going to have to do so as we look for areas where we can collaborate and cooperate. But there are some things that we're simply not going to accept in terms of violating the international order and the rules of the road. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tWhat about Russia, the other big strategic nuclear power here? \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tYeah, we're going to have to deal with Putin and Putin's Russia. We made an attempt. You'll remember when we had Russian Marines and U.S. Marines training together in North Carolina for possible joint operations back in the 1990s. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tYes. \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tAnd those days are sadly over. Putin has chosen, in many ways, to try and destabilize countries along his periphery. He's changed borders in Georgia and the Ukraine using military force. He's mucked around in our elections and European elections. \tThe reason the murderous Assad is still in power in Syria is because Russia has been their ally. He would have been out by the Syrian people's efforts years ago without Russia's help. So we're going to have to deal with this reality. And it's best deals with, like most issues throughout your and my time in  government service, Michael, with a coalition, with allies. \tWe cannot deal with this and deter Russia effectively and authoritatively without having allies with us. And that means NATO is critical to America's security and to preventing war, preventing war, deterring war when we're up against someone like Putin, who is playing his very weak hand very, very well. So we're going to have to deal with the Russia that is, not the Russia we wanted. We wanted a better relationship. All of NATO wanted a better relationship. And, well, Putin has voted no. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tRight, he went in a different direction. \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tExactly. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tWhat about North Korea, sir? How do you think about North Korea? \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tWell, North Korea is probably the most urgent issue that we deal with \u00a0 right now. And the diplomacy has been, I think, tried with some success by the current administration. We don't have missiles arching up over the Japanese home islands right now. \tBut, at the same time, there has been no real progress on lessening the nuclear threat from North Korea or the missile program. They are both still in existence, and nothing has turned them back. So this, again, is going to require like-minded nations to work together to find diplomatic or economic ways of dealing with Korea that makes it in their best interest to abandon those programs that are so worrisome for many nations. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tAnd then there's the one that you and I spent so much time working on, Iran. \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tYeah. Well, Iran remains a very strong supporter of terrorism. They have not been hurt by America's counter-terror efforts, which have been focused on Al-Qaeda and \u00a0 Al-Qaeda-related associated movements. And I think that what we're seeing now with Iran is a country that is willing to forego what is in the best interests of their own people and basically work for what's in the best interests of the regime. \tBecause we do not have a problem with, I would say, the Iranian people. We have an issue with the Iranian regime. And that regime has been found to kill former prime ministers in Beirut to foment the ongoing conflict, and basically to keep the Houthis in Yemen well-supplied and on the crack of continued fighting, even as the U.N. tries to stop this with the Americans' help and a lot of other nations. We see what they're doing in Bahrain. We watch what they're doing in Syria. They even tried to kill the Saudi ambassador less than two miles from the White House a few years ago. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tYes, they did. \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tAnd we caught them red-handed. We caught them red-handed, and all we did about it was put their low-level courier in jail, when, in fact, this was an operation approved at the highest levels in Tehran. And so, if that's a country that would act like that, trying to kill an ambassador in Washington, D.C., with a car bomb, in Georgetown, you can imagine what they're like to live near. \tWhether you're Israel or our Arab partners, there's a lot of concern. And, again, like every one of the issues you've brought up, Michael, this has to be addressed by America working in concert with allies and partners. We cannot settle this on our own, nor should we try to settle this on our own. We have got to build alliances and partnerships, coalitions to deal with these challenges to national security. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tMr. Secretary, you've been amazing with sharing your time with us. Thank you. I just have one more question. Which  is, if you think about the capabilities that our country has to defend itself against these threats and challenges that are out there, you know, I think about military power, I think about strategic and tactical intelligence capabilities, I think about diplomacy, and I think about those alliances that you have mentioned a number of times, what's your assessment of the health of those capabilities that are so important to us protecting ourselves?\u00a0 \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tWell, the capabilities, certainly, we don't have the same overriding advantage that we once had technologically. As China rises, Russia puts money into their nuclear arsenal and all, you can see in some areas, including some new areas that you mentioned, hypersonics and all, that we're going to have to once again put a lot of effort into maintaining our technological edge. \tBut, as I look this more broadly, I would just say that we have to remember that America has two fundamental sources \u00a0 of power in this world. And one of them is the power of inspiration. And the other is the power of intimidation. And, certainly, we need our spies, our sentinels out there watching what's going on so we don't get caught flat-footed. \tIn fact, right now, we need to strengthen our intelligence services for this kind of world that we're in today, especially being that we've shrunk our military in the last 25 years. But we also have to remember that, at times, good exchange programs with foreign students to come to America and learn here may strengthen us as much as any military effort. \tIn other words, the example of America, if we can show that we can govern, if we can go back to compromising in Washington and coming up with good policies on everything from health care to defense to climate change, if we can come back to a common ground of unity, of governing with a sense of friendship  toward one another in America, a sense of respect for one another, that example will draw allies to us. \tBecause people want the kind of world that we can deliver. And America's a uniquely capable country in this regard. And I think, the more time we spend on coming back together as a people-- sure, have good, strong arguments about the various policies and the issues-- but when we're done with that, we come back together, and we are friendly toward one another, we can show the world how to solve problems and do so in a way that builds a sense of unity and a sense of peace and prosperity. And that's where I think we need to really focus right now. \t\tMICHAEL MORELL: \tWell, that's a great way to end, Mr. Secretary. Thank you so much for spending time with us today. \t\tGEN. JAMES MATTIS: \tOh, you're welcome, Michael. It's a pleasure to talk with you again. \t\t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - MARC POLYMEROPOULOS CORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELL PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON MICHAEL MORELL: Marc, welcome to Intelligence Matters. It is great to have you on the show. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Thank you very much. It's good to be here. MICHAEL MORELL: People need to know that you and I are friends and our families are friends. I think it's important for my listeners to know that. What it probably means for you, Marc, is that I probably need to be tougher on you than I am on most guests, so be prepared, pal. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Not a problem. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay. I actually want to start in a little bit different place than I had originally p lanned. I know that you have spent some time in the Middle East, and I know that you have spent some time actually working with the Kurds in Iraq, which are a little bit different than the Kurds in Syria. But I really, Marc, wanted to get your reaction, from someone who's actually been on the ground, have actually had to work with folks like the Kurds to advance American interests, I wanted to get your reaction to what's happened in the last couple days, and to particularly what's happening today with the Turks rolling into northern Syria. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Sure. You know, I think when, you know, I saw the news over the last several days of what the administration had decided, and then I think overnight, the Turkish incursion, you know, it's almost a punch to the gut, at least for myself, for two decades served really on the front lines, helping train these indigenous forces. It's on a personal level for me because this is not, you know, talking about kind of geopolitics. This is face-to-face with allies, whether they're in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Syria who really put all their faith in the US government, and even more particular in those of us who were on the ground training them or working with them. And so you know, I can see the faces of our Kurdish partners, our Syrian partners, even our Afghan partners as they see what, you know, is nothing other than a total betrayal. And I think this'll have a lot of ramifications into the future as well, because there will be other conflicts where we're gonna need our local partners. MICHAEL MORELL: And they're now gonna wonder whether they can trust us for the long term? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: That's right. Undoubtedly. And again, you know, I recall there was a great Kurdish leader (this is over 20 years ago), we were living up in the mountains in Kurdistan and I had given them our promises of future American support. And I think, you know, the Kurds are a special lot because they've been betrayed over the years by, you know, everyone from the Iranians, to the Israelis, to Saddam. But after my promises of a future, you know, democratic Iraq when we rid the country of Saddam, you know, he took me aside and he said, \"Look, you know, we're gonna do this for ourselves. We need your support but everything we do is not based on the American ideal; it really is gonna be based on just your promise of support.\" So I think, you know, even the Kurds who understood Realpolitik very well, you know, this is really a dark day, not only for the United States but for a lot of intelligence and special operations warriors who spent time on the front lines with these forces. MICHAEL MORELL: And I imagine, you know, going forward, whether you're in the intelligence community or whether you're in the military, and you're having conversations with indigenous forces somewhere else that we might want to support, that it's gonna be tough. It's gonna be tough to make the case, right, \"That we're gonna be with you for the long term, and you're gonna be able to count on the United States,\" right? It's gonna be tough to keep a straight face and say that. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: That's right. And you know, the Middle East is a small area, so everyone is gonna look back kind of on what's occurred over the last several hours and days, and this is really gonna hurt us into the future. Again, this is from the ground level; to me it was a punch in the gut. I think there's a lot of intelligence officers and special operations officers who are having some sleepless nights, because they're looking at the faces of the individuals that we have betrayed. MICHAEL MORELL: Marc, this is the first interview that you've done ever. You retired from the agency earlier this summer. You've done some writing. you've shared your thoughts with the public on several different issues. One of those is what we're gonna talk about at length, which is, you know, how does politics affect CIA, and is CIA political? So I really wanna get into that discussion. But this being your first interview, and the fact that you've written a handful of things, why did you decide to share your views publicly after a life in the clandestine service? MICHAEL MORELL: Sure. Well, you know, after 26 years really all spent, you know, in the shadows, I think I wanted to come and give context to the American people about the organization that I really so deeply believe in, that was not just my job but, you know, it was a calling, it was my passion. You know, I think the CIA has a soul, you know, it has a culture. And there's so much good that we do. So you know, quite simply, I just wanted to write and talk about it. MICHAEL MORELL: So Marc, before we get into the discussion of politics in CIA, let me ask you a few questions about your career. You started at the agency in 1993. How did you end up there? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Sure. Well, you know, I grew up in New Jersey just really a regular middle class kid, you know, listening to Bon Jovi and Springsteen, (LAUGH) and going to the Jersey Shore. I think you'd actually be surprised how many New Jerseyites are at CIA. I think former director John Brennan as well, is one-- MICHAEL MORELL: Yes. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: But really, two things led me to CIA. And you know, this is just, you know, kind of on a personal level. One was I read James Michener's book, Caravans, which was about a young foreign service officer in Afghanistan, and I was mesmerized by this, you know, Lawrence of Arabia type story. And then the second one, which was really memorable, was a trip my father, who was a college professor, he was teaching in Algeria. So my father and his best friend and I, when I was ten years old, we drove 1,000 miles through the Sahara Desert in Algeria in a Volkswagen minibus. And so I became completely hooked-- MICHAEL MORELL: Wow-- MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: --on the Middle East then. And after und ergrad and grad school at Cornell I was really hired into the only job I've ever had. MICHAEL MORELL: You know, this reminds me of a conversation I had with somebody who's undercover, but somebody you know well, somebody who was the head of the counterterrorism center when I was the deputy director. And he told me that one weekend he had gone to graduation for a relative of his, and how he went to this graduation and was talking with all the kids, and how disappointed he was. And I said, \"What do you mean?\" And he said, \"Well, I asked them about their overseas experience and they told me about London, and Rome, and Paris. And what I wanted to hear is somebody who had hiked their way across Africa.\" MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: That's right. MICHAEL MORELL: \"That's what I wanted to hear.\" So sounds like you got that right. So Marc, you started as an analyst, right? You did that for four years, then you switched to operations. What made you make that change? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: That's right. Well, so as -- MICHAEL MORELL: You started in my side of the agency-- MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: I did, I did. And it's a really interesting story, because actually so many of my first experiences and the analytic side shaped the operational side of my career later on. But you know, I started in 1993 on the Afghan desk, and interestingly we had begun tracking a young supporter of the worldwide Islamic terrorist movement, a man called Osama bin Laden. And I actually coauthored one of the first papers ever written on these Afghan war veterans. And then even in the third week of my analyst training, the third week when I was on the job at CIA, that's when Mir Aimal Kansi killed several of our colleagues outside the front gate. MICHAEL MORELL: January of '93. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: January of '93. And so you know, even as an analyst, you know, these were signs of what I would spend really the majority of my career on. But as for my analytic career, I think in 1995 after a TDY, a temporary duty assignment, on a trip to the Middle East I decided I wanted to switch tracks. And I came back and I talked to my group chief, someone who I think you know very well; he was John Brennan. And I went into his office and I said, \"I'd like to become a case officer.\" And very quickly, and in retrospect too quickly, (LAUGH) he agreed it would be a great idea to switch tracks. (LAUGHTER) Looking back that was clear maybe I was not the crack analyst that I thought I \u00a0 was. But off I went into the DO. And then much later on when John was the director and I was in a field management role in the Middle East I reminded him of this story and we laughed. And you know, in truth he kept me in the agency, so that was a good thing. And-- MICHAEL MORELL: You would've made a great analyst, (LAUGH) I'm absolutely certain of that. So Marc, what can you tell us in an unclassified setting here - we gotta keep reminding people of that - about the training program that operations officers go through? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Sure. You know, I think in a nutshell it's very close to the reality of work and life in the field. It is that good. It's a lot about time management, it's about testing yourself and your ability to operate alone. And it's not for everyone. You know, people do fail and that's okay. You know, there is a washout rate. MICHAEL MORELL: So it's not like five-year-old soccer, where everybody gets a trophy at the end? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: No, everyone does not get a trophy in the end. And look, (LAUGH) in the end you have to be able to master the core skills of a case officer, which is how to, you know, detect surveillance, how to handle agents with, you know, top-notch tradecraft. And then, of course, the core business of spotting, assessing, developing, and recruiting. I think I would often marvel even years later with real-world operations, and I look back and I would say that, you know, what I learned in my training was spot-on. MICHAEL MORELL: So Marc, what is it like to recruit another human being to spy for the United States? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Michael, that's a great question. I love that question because it goes to the heart of why I really loved the job as a case officer. Because you know, ultimately it's about, I think, the most basic of human personal relationships. I mean, I'd call it a romance, and then it's a marriage. You know, it's ultimately about getting close enough to another human being that you're able to assess their motivation to a point where you garner their agreement to betray their country, and that's an incredibly intimate relationship. And in the end you're looking at someone who says to you, \"I'm gonna put my life in your hands.\" You know, think about that as a responsibility of a young officer. There's probably no other job like that, you know, in the USG, or even anywhere. MICHAEL MORELL: So once they say yes, you really have two jobs, right? One is to acquire the intelligence that they have access to, and the other is to keep them safe. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: That's right. MICHAEL MORELL: And that's a huge responsibility that the agency takes extraordinary seriously. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: And you have that responsibility at a very young age. MICHAEL MORELL: And then the flipside is the importance of keeping our officers, our operations officers, our case officers who are interacting with these assets, safe. And you had an experience where somebody who worked for you was actually killed by someone that we thought was an asset. Can you talk about that a little bit? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: That's right. I think, you know, this was what every day you hoped and prayed would ne ver happen. You know, I'll never forget standing in front of several hundred officers at a station and announcing the death of our colleague. And you know, to many he was a great friend. You know, this was a truly awful experience, and I can still hear, you know, the howls of one officer when she heard the news. It was absolutely gut-wrenching. I can't even recall, frankly, what I said that day. I remember taking the initial phone call that our officer had been killed, and immediately calling an all-hands. Actually, I saw my wife at the embassy as well, and to this day she said she'd never seen such a look on my face. She knew something was wrong. And you know, I'll tell you, even today I have intense feelings of guilt for what occurred because, you know, ultimately I was in charge. And I've about a billion times gone through my mind how, you know, I personally failed. Years later when I received my promotion to the senior intelligence service ranks, my first thought was that I did not deserve that, as that I had lost someone under my command. Now you know, I obviously have intense feelings of what occurred, so you try to take these feelings and kind of impart this on to the next generation of agency leaders. Because in our work this unfortunately does happen, and you have to be prepared for it. I'll finish this with, you know, one day I was having dinner with the deputy Centcom commander, and I told him of my struggles, coming to terms with the death of one officer. And he responded that, you know, he really dealt with this on an industrial scale. MICHAEL MORELL: Sure, sure. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: And so that was really sobering, and you know, it's a tough business. MICHAEL MORELL: Marc, let's switch and talk about politics in the CIA. But I think in order to set the predicate for that I need to ask you a couple things. So as an operations officer you broadly did three things, right? You recruited spies, you built and maintained liaison relationships with foreign intelligence services, and you helped conduct covert action. Let's set the last one aside because we probably shouldn't talk about that. (LAUGH) MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: But talk for a minute about the importance of recruitment operations to national security. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Sure. Look, there's no substitute in my mind for, you know, what is in essence a human s py. So for a penetration of a terrorist group who could provide information on plots to attack Americans, to the penetration of a prime minister's office of a country who's negotiating a trade deal with us, or penetration of a hostile nuclear program. You know, these are operations that could inform us of the most detailed plans of our adversaries. It's obviously one element of the intelligence picture. There's signals intelligence as well, as we're listening on the communications of our allies. But you know, in my view - and I kinda go back to the bottom line in dealing with a human spy - these are someone who can provide us ground truth, who can maybe provide us documents, can answer our tasking. It's an interactive relationship, and that's really unmatched. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, it's that ability to go back and ask questions, right? Follow up. You know, \"What did you mean by that? What did you mean by this? Can you answer that question? Can you answer this question?\" that really, I think, sets it apart from the other collection systems, right? Those can't do that. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: But a human source can. When you were in the field running assets and then managing case officers who were running assets, did you see the impact of your work? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Oh, I mean, I think we can have extraordinary impact. So even in the later stages of my career when I had, you know, senior operational leadership positions in several of the mission centers, I would go back and I would kind of tell the following to people, that I would recall five or six times in my career where the front page stories in The Washington Post or New York Times were the results of our operational work. You know, of course no mention of CIA. But you know, that feeling that you were a part of history, that you know, perhaps you helped shape history, and I'm not exaggerating on that, that's unmatched. I can give a example of an impact that was, you know, not geopolitical in nature, more personal that was in South Asia where I was managing one of our bases. We were tracking a terrorist target, and this terrorist target had killed one of our officers several years prior, and this target was still continuing to plan operations against Americans. So we recruited agents on the ground and over months worked against this target where we finally had him on the X and we -- MICHAEL MORELL: You finally located him? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: We located him, and we called in an airstrike, and we killed the terrorist. And on the impact of that, you know, I'll say that later that night - this is from 10,000 miles away - we called our officer's widow who was all the way back in the United States, and she thanked us. And you know, that remains a really proud moment of my time in CIA, and to me it's certainly operational impact. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay, Marc, now talk about the importance to the United States of America, right, of CIA's relationships with foreign intelligence services. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Sure. And I think this is something that's not often really talked enough about in our line of business. But really, our foreign partnerships remain a cornerstone of our intelligence collection. You know, from our Five Eyes Alliance that's with the UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, to you know, our allies in the Balkans or the Middle East, you know, we've really built a worldwide web of allies, and we cooperate together against, you know, the hardest of targets. MICHAEL MORELL: So they give us intelligence? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: They do. And friendly services have, you know, taken down terrorist plots against Americans, have interdicted nuclear material. They've helped us catch spies in our midst, and provided us critical intelligence on our hard targets, like Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China. So they're indispensable. And as operational managers in the field and at headquarters, we spent a huge amount of time nurturing these relationships. And again, it goes back to what I talked about before in terms of recruitment operations. This is different, but there's an art to Liaison operations as well. Because again, it's all human contact, and it's personal relations, and it's just simply a critical part of the job. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay. So with that as background, now we're gonna get to the political discussion. And maybe the way to do this, Marc, is for me to lay out some of the narratives that are in the public domain about CIA. CIA in politics and the influence of politics on CIA. So I think the first narrative is that the agency has a political agenda, that the agency plays in domestic politics here in the United States, the it wants to influence politics here in the United States. In fact, Tucker Carlson, a Fox News commentator, accused CIA of wanting to remove President Trump from office, and that it was actually acting to do so. The whistleblower was an example of that, he said. What I want to ask you, Marc, is in your 26 years of service, did you ever see any evidence of this narrative? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: No. You know, first of all, the answer is a clear and unequivocal no. And you know, I see this in the press, and you asked previously why I wanted to speak out, and so you know, this is one of the reasons to address questions like this, because I think it's a utterly absurd accusation. And it actually makes me sad because it goes against the fundamental principle, or the fundamental premise of our role, which was to protect the American people. So to me that narrative is deeply insulting, but I suppose it does need to be addressed. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. In fact, somebody who I know, somebody who I grew up with actually called me after the Tucker Carlson thing and said, \"Does the CIA really do that?\" MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: So these narratives matter. So it matters that people who have worked there and have worked there recently, like you did, can speak out and say it's not true. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: It's not true at all. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay. So there's another narrative out there, right? Let me back up a minute. So this doesn't mean that agency officers don't have their own personal political views. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Of course. MICHAEL MORELL: Right, of course they do. Do people talk about them in the workplace? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: So you know, ordinarily, no. We're too busy. I mean, that's kind of, you know, what I tell people. And you know, when I (LAUGH) was at CIA we don't even have access to Twitter inside the building. I mean, perhaps the operations center does, but we didn't follow the tweets, we didn't follow what was happening. We're too busy in the end. But of course I have close friends in the agency, you know, a select few who I would socialize on the side, and do I know their politics maybe a little bit. But I can also tell you, if we named 20 CIA officers that I worked closely with, other than maybe some of my close friends, I have no idea who they even voted for. I think what we did pay attention to, and this is because it was part of our job, so for example, in a congressional election, you know, the oversight committee members may change. Well, that's a big deal to us because we have a lot of dealings with oversight. So that is of interest, who is now gonna be on the HPSCI or SSCI. But again, at the end of the day, talking politics in the workplace is not a prime job duty of an organization that is designed to protect America. MICHAEL MORELL: And to the extent that you might happen to know what somebody's personal political views are, did you ever see those views affect what that person did in the workplace or decisions that that person made about their responsibilities? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: No. Again, first of all, the answer is no. And it's again, a question I find, it's almost amazing that we have to address this. I mean, I look back personally, did I agree with every foreign policy decision that was made? Of course not. Yet I deployed to multiple war zones, you know, I carried out the best of my abilities my operational duties. You know, I joke with people, I have intelligence medals from operations in areas of the world in which I didn't personally view our policy was correct. It didn't matter at all. MICHAEL MORELL: So Marc, one of the other narratives that is out there is that because of the president's decisions, because of his behavior, because of his critique of our allies, because of his embracing some of our adversaries, and I could go on and on here, that he has personally made the job of agency officers harder. Did you see anything in either terms of recruitment operations or in terms of our relationships with foreign intelligence services - which is why I wanted to talk about those earlier - that would be evidence of that narrative? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: So look, I think this is actually a really useful narrative to ponder, and I've thought a lot about this. Because it would be very easy for us to say, you know, \"Yes, because of the president's unorthodox style, you know, he's a disruptor for the international world order.\" You know, the tweets sometimes insulting foreign leaders, et cetera. But really, upon close analysis, to me that just does not fly, and that's a really good thing. So in terms of recruitments, no. I mean, I don't think it has made our job of recruiting foreign assets more difficult. Because as I kind of considered what are the factors in which a foreign official would decide to spy for the United States, you know, these are all really personal motivations. Whether it's individual needs based on financial need for a sick relative, or education for their children, or maybe dissatisfaction in the workplace, they're a religious minority in a country where there is a glass ceiling, or maybe they've been passed over for a promotion. But none of these have to do with whether or not, you know, President Trump has made a tweet or has, you know, insulted another foreign leader, or disrupted the world order. I think, again, recruiting assets is a very personal decision for the agent to say yes. And so I don't think there has been an effect. In terms of Liaison, you know, this is where -- MICHAEL MORELL: Relationships with foreign intelligence services. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: I'm sorry. So yes, so Liaison is our, you know, well-established relationship with foreign services over the entire globe. And look, Liaison is very well-attuned to American politics, probably more so than we are. They're very smart. And so look, in my assignments, after the elections in 2016 I was obliged to spend really a significant amount of time with senior foreign intelligence service officials. You know, they were curiously assessing-- MICHAEL MORELL: Us. (LAUGH) MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: --us, and the new president, and his style. And you know, they were under some pressure from their masters as well. And they'd be asked at times, you know, maybe to brace us about something that the White House had put forward. But look, we've dealt with this very professionally, and I believe correctly by just we would note that we were all intelligence professionals, that it was best to ignore the politics, and then on our arena, which is, really building and even strengthening the bilateral ties between the respective services. And you know, I look back, there is tremendous historic precedence for this. So I think in one of CIA's finest hours in the Middle East was our link to the Jordanian Security Services. But this was years ago, this was the Jordanian then-king Hussein. If \u00a0 you recall after Saddam invaded Kuwait, the US and Jordan essentially severed bilateral ties. MICHAEL MORELL: The king supported the Iraqis. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: He did. But CIA maintained the ties to the Jordanians and was kind of the sole entity that was able to kind of rebuild the entire bilateral relationship. And look at today, you know, Jordan is one of our indispensable allies. So just to go back to the original question, no, I think our work with Liaison under this White House has flourished. You know, I will note, I think it's a question, if one asked, to senior FBI or Department of State officials, they may have a different answer. Those are organizations that I think have had a bit of a tougher time than we are. MICHAEL MORELL: So Marc, maybe one more thought just to u nderscore what you said about Liaison relationships, is in my experience they not only survive tough political times, but they become the bedrock on which you rebuild a political relationship down the road, which I think is exactly what happened with Jordan. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: So I think CIA's relationships with other countries is gonna be really important here going forward. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: That's right, I agree. MICHAEL MORELL: So one more narrative, Marc, that's out there. And that is that unlike the Bush and Obama administrations, this one, the Trump administration, particularly the president himself, has little interest in intelligence, is not paying attention, has little interest in what the agency has to say. Is that narrative accurate? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: No, I actually think it's not accurate at all. And I think, first of all, you have to separate, you know, the administration from the president himself. So you know, in my time under this current White House - and again, I retired in June of this year - there was a huge appetite for intelligence. The National Security Council, for example, were voracious consumers, the various national security advisors we've gone through. And I think, you know, a perfect example of this was the US government's response to the brazen Russian attempts to kill Sergei Skripal in the UK in March of 2018. There was a well-coordinated and really well-executed USG response led by the CIA, working through the White House. And it really was a textbook example of the administration turning to the CIA to really kind of put the screws in the Russians. So this was a shining moment, and that to me is not an example at all of an administration disinterested-- MICHAEL MORELL: If I remember correctly, the president didn't want to take action, right, and was ultimately talked into it by his senior advisors. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: You know, look, I cannot comment on President Trump himself, and I'm not a member nor was a part of the briefing team. That's a separate subject. But look, I'll note there is historic precedent for presidents to have a less than stellar desire for briefings. You know, there's a famous Washington vignette, if you recall. Many years ago during the Clinton administration there was a small plane that crashed on the White House lawn, and the joke at that time was that then DCIA James Woolsey was trying to get in to see President Clinton, who wasn't taking his PDB, his presidential daily brief. And Woolsey would tell that joke himself. So my point on that is let's not judge the administration, their interest in intelligence, you know, just by what we hear about only the president. MICHAEL MORELL: So in your experience over the last few years, secretary of state's interest in intelligence? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: That's correct. MICHAEL MORELL: High? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: You know, I think, that it probably was a bit different under Secretary of State Tillerson. He had a unique management style. MICHAEL MORELL: But Pompeo? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Pompeo for sure, who you know, got to know our building very well, and you know, was an avid consumer when he was our director -- MICHAEL MORELL: Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the joint chiefs? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Absolutely. Our counterparts at DOD were enormously interested, you know, primarily because of all the hotspots around the world. MICHAEL MORELL: Marc, with all of these narratives out there, right, CIA officers can't help to read about this stuff in the paper, right-- MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Sure. MICHAEL MORELL: How would you assess the morale at CIA, you know, given all the fluidity of all the po litics, and the way it's swirling around? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Sure. Look, you know, and as a senior leader when I left, you know, I was hyper attuned to this, because this is kind of, you know, the health of our organization. But my conclusion again, and this is despite kind of the political storm in Washington, morale was very high. There are young men and women who want to serve their country, really in a unique line of work. I think one of the key points that we stress, and which is true, is that the CIA today has sufficient resources to do our job and enjoys significant support on the Hill for our activities, and that's not always the case. So we have to really focus on that, and I think our officers know that. It's a place where, you know, diversity and inclusion is practiced, and this is really important. But you know, back to the political side of the question, you know, CIA officers are kind of \u00a0 always cranky. So I think morale is high but we're always cranky-- MICHAEL MORELL: Particularly analysts, if I remember correctly. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: And look, you know, (LAUGH) if you remember under President Obama, and you were of course there at the time, look, the National Security Council was a really bloated and at times stultifying entity, and we complained all the time about a lack of timely decision-making. So I would say morale is high and CIA officers remain, you know, appropriately cranky. MICHAEL MORELL: Marc, did you as a senior leader have to talk to your troops about all of this? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: So you know, I think it would be negligent if we did not, so the answer is yes. And so you know, in my last job I would meet and g reet every officer from every career track in our mission center, whether it be a support officer, operations officer, targeting officer, and analyst. MICHAEL MORELL: But you had all these people working for you-- in this new reorganization that John Brennan put in place? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: That's right. And in their orientations I would make sure and come, and kind of address, you know, that giant elephant in the room. And I would simply say to ignore the politics and just, you know, put your head down and get to work. And I think that really did work because at the end of the day I go back to the morale. People come to the agency, really, for the right reasons, and they looked at the front page. You know, my last job was running operations in Europe and Russia. If you can't get motivated every day to come to work after what the Russians did to us in 2016, you know, it's probably a wrong line of work for ya. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. So Marc, just a coupla more questions here. What are the things that you're gonna miss about-- MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Oh, sure-- MICHAEL MORELL: --goin' to work every day at the agency? MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: So you know, I look back on kind of several moments that I think about all the time, you know, and both, you know, in the field and at headquarters. But you know, I recall walking from my apartment in a Middle Eastern capital. It was a place we were under heavy scrutiny from a hostile intelligence service, leading this small group of men and women at a station, walking up to the embassy at night. And you know, you see the American flag under that spotlight, and that to me was inspiring not only for officers at the embassy and the station, but also many in the host country who believed in the American ideal. I still get goosebumps about those days. I talked about before my feelings of CIA being a family. When I was in Afghanistan my mom died, and I was serving on a frontline base along the Pak/Afghan border. And a return to the United States, to New Jersey, was going to take multiple helicopter flights and fixed-wing flights to make it home for the funeral. Our helicopter pilots, who are military veterans from the special operations community and probably the most accomplished on the planet, they flew me through terrible weather to get back home. And I remember being on the headset in the helicopter telling them to turn around. You know, we were in a narrow mountain pass and the weather was terrible, and I was worried about the safety of the air crew as well. And when we finally got to the base and we landed, you know, they said, \"Look, we did this for you. We know what happened to your mom.\" MICHAEL MORELL: Wow. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: And so to me, how do you not have incredible loyalty to an organization that has men and women like that? And CIA to me is a family. I think it has a soul, you know, it has a beating heart. I never had a boring day in 26 years. And so I was really lucky to be a part of that, so I'm sure I will certainly miss it. MICHAEL MORELL: Marc, thank you very much for joining us. MARC POLYMEROPOULOS: Thank you. * * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "Today, lawyers representing the whistleblower who ignited the impeachment inquiry say there is a second whistleblower now, who is familiar with the phone call between President Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine. That phone call came to light two weeks ago after a U.S. intelligence officer filed an official complaint alleging Mr. Trump solicited a foreign government to help his 2020 campaign. Late Friday, the White House received its first congressional subpoena for records. Also last week, members of Congress went home to hear from their constituents. We travelled with two members who are now facing some of the most consequential decisions of their careers. Their congressional districts are 1,700 miles and worlds apart. New Jersey's 11th Congressional District is white, suburban and wealthy. Texas' 23rd Congressional District is wide open and 70% Latino. The Texas district is represented by a Republican: Will Hurd.\u00a0 Will Hurd: Now, these are allegations that the whistleblower brought up. And we should be trying to understand what is true and what isn't. The representative for New Jersey's 11th District is a Democrat: Mikie Sherrill. Scott Pelley: Many Americans are saying, \"We just went through two years of this with the Mueller Report. And now we're gonna do this again?\" Mikie Sherrill: I think what I'm asking for from the American people is faith. Faith in our democratic values. Faith that we can do this, relatively quickly and get to the bottom of this, and protect our democracy. There was no 'bottom', last week, to the cascading events. Thursday, the president's former point-man on Ukraine, Ambassador Kurt Volker, provided text messages to Congress. Among them was a text Volker sent to his counterpart on President Zelensky's staff in preparation for the phone call. \"Heard from White House,\" Volker wrote, \"Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for a visit to Washington.\" This suggested Zelensky would be invited to the Oval Office if he agreed to investigate a rumor that Ukrainians helped Democrats in 2016 and were hiding a Democratic email server. There is no known evidence of this. Last Wednesday, Mr. Trump doubled down on what he said in the call. President Donald Trump: Believe it or not, I watch my words very carefully. There are those that think I'm a very stable genius. Okay? I watch my words very, very closely.\u00a0 The call with Zelensky came in July, days after Mr. Trump suspended military sales to Ukraine, which is fighting rebels backed by Russia. In the official record, President Zelensky asked for Javelin anti-tank missiles. President Trump replied, \"I would like you to do us a favor though.\" That's when he asked Zelensky to investigate the rumor about 2016.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: What do you make of that? Will Hurd: I wouldn't have handled the conversation that way\u00a0 Republican Will Hurd is on the committee leading the investigation. Will Hurd: It is behavior that I wouldn't have done. Scott Pelley: Is it improper? Will Hurd: Is it an impeachable offense? I don't think so. But that, in concert with some of the allegations made by the whistleblower, is why I think we should understand what actually happened and the lead up to that phone call-- in my opinion is more-- is more important to understand, motivations and intentions by all the actors involved. New Jersey Democrat Mikie Sherrill is a former Navy pilot, federal prosecutor, and military advisor on Russia. She opposed previous calls for an impeachment inquiry until the phone call.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: President Zelensky says we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes and President Trump's immediate response is \"I'd like you to do us a favor though.\"\u00a0 Mikie Sherrill: This is what's so critical. Those Javelins are pretty much what stands between-- Western Europe and Russian tank forces. To put that security aid at risk because he wants to not fulfill the duties of the President of the United States of America but to, instead, serve his own personal self-interest that, again, was the bright line. Representative Sherrill's New Jersey district lies across the Hudson from Manhattan. Last November, she became the first Democrat to win the seat in 34 years. Over coffee, we heard from her constituents; Republican Karen Arakelian; Democrat, Brett Wellman; and Kathy Abbott, who was a Republican member of a town council. Kathy Abbott: Well, I do think that a line was crossed. Now he's meddling in foreign policy without understanding policy and understanding that you cannot involve foreign governments in your reelection campaign. Scott Pelley: You've been a Republican how long? Kathy Abbott: About 25 years. Karen Arakelian: I disagree. I think this is something that has been being asked for since the day the man was elected. And they're just waiting and trying to find something, making many big things out of nothing. And this is another one. And I think the truth will come out. And I'm kinda glad that they're doing it because what we heard of the conversation is basically a conversation between two leaders of countries and they want to get to the bottom of what happened. Brett Wellman: Private conversations and leveraging the office of the Presidency of the United States and federal funds are two very different things.\u00a0 Karen Arakelian: Is that what you think happened? Brett Wellman: Yes! Karen Arakelian: I don't think that's what happened at all.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: What would you say to someone who says, \"Look, we're 13 months away from the election. Let the voters decide\"? Mikie Sherrill: When we are seeing the president already taking steps to undermine the 2020 elections, I'm not sure we have that luxury.\u00a0\u00a0Will Hurd's district stretches from San Antonio to El Paso. Hurd is the only black Republican in the House. A former CIA officer in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: Anybody talking to you about impeachment? Will Hurd: No, when you look at the calls or the emails that we get into the office from constituents it's no different. Gun violence is still an issue in my district. And still we have a crisis going on along our border.\u00a0 In San Antonio, we brought up impeachment with Democrats, Jennifer Falcon and Trish Mendoza, and Republicans, Andres Holliday and Stephen Pennington.\u00a0 Jennifer Falcon: I think we should have done it a long time ago. Trump has incited violence and is a misogynist and has really fueled the fire of racism in America.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: Andres, what do you see in the phone call? Andres Holliday: I see something that most likely happens on a day-to-day basis with leaders of nations. I mean all the time there's going to be conversations of \"How can we work together on things?\" Trish Mendoza: I read the transcripts like probably all of us have like a lot of people have and what I read was sounded like our president pressuring the head of a foreign government to do him a favor, a political favor.\u00a0 Stephen Pennington: We'll have to see what comes out. Because, I don't see anything that would rise to high crimes and misdemeanors, an impeachable offense. I just don't see it. \u00a0 President Donald Trump: And Biden is not the brightest person. All week, Mr. Trump worked to shift attention to his reelection rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump: If Biden is corrupt, if his son is corrupt, when his son takes out billions of dollars billions, when they do that, that's no good. Biden is the focus of a conspiracy theory for which no evidence has been publicly produced. In the Obama White House, Biden worked with the European Union to force out a Ukrainian prosecutor who was considered weak on corruption. At the time, Biden's son was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been investigated but not charged. There is the appearance of a conflict of interest, but Ukraine says neither Biden was suspected of anything illegal. Still, Mr. Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pushed a theory that Biden must have forced the prosecutor out to protect his son from something. On the call with Zelensky, Mr. Trump says, \"The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\" Mr. Trump was offering U.S. Attorney General William Barr to help in a foreign government investigating one of his reelection opponents. Barr denies being involved.\u00a0 President Donald Trump: China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with, uh, with Ukraine. Mr. Trump's surprising request to China, last week, for no stated reason, was an example of the president of the United States hurling indictments without facts. In a news conference with Finland's president, Reuters reporter Jeff Mason asked Mr. Trump what he wanted Zelensky to do in regard to the Bidens. President Donald Trump: Look, Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked. And you know it. His son walks out with millions of dollars. The kid knows nothing. You know it, and so do we. Go ahead. Ask a question now. Jeff Mason: The question, sir, was: What did you want President Zelensky to do about Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter? President Donald Trump: Are you talking to me? Jeff Mason: It was a just a follow-up of what I just asked you, sir. President Donald Trump: Listen. Listen. Are you ready? We have the President of Finland. Ask him a question. Jeff Mason: I have one for him. I just wanted to follow up on the one that I asked you, which was \u2014 President Donald Trump: Did you hear me? Jeff Mason: \u2014 what did you want him to \u2014 President Donald Trump: Did you hear me? Jeff Mason: Yes, sir. President Donald Trump: Ask him a question. Jeff Mason: I will, but \u2014 President Donald Trump: I've given you a long answer. Ask this gentleman a question. Don't be rude. Jeff Mason: No, sir. I don't want to be rude. I just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question that I asked you. President Donald Trump: I've answered everything. It's a whole hoax. And you know who's playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country. And I say, in many cases, the \"corrupt media\" \u2014 because you're corrupt. \u00a0 Among those text messages given to Congress, one seemed to clear the president's motives. The senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine complained, \"I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\" The U.S. ambassador to the European Union replied, \"The president has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo's of any kind.\" But that message was written days after the Ukraine story had broken in public. A CBS News poll shows 55% of voters support the investigation. Our restaurant poll found 100% agreement on how the political parties should proceed.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: You all believe that this should be top priority in Washington today and that the other things should wait? Brett Wellman: Absolutely. Kathy Abbott: Unfortunately, yes. Karen Arakelian: Let's get it done now at this point. It's happening. Let's do it as quickly as possible, 'cause there's a lot of really important issues that have to be addressed. Scott Pelley: These last two weeks have been pretty tough and I wonder if any of you think that the rhetoric is already way too overheated? Trish Mendoza: I think it's been overheated for a while. The temperature needs to be cooled down significantly so that people who are just regular citizens, voters like ourselves, can come together and actually have conversations about the way forward.\u00a0 Andres Holliday: I could \u2013 I could not agree with that-- that more. I think-- that-- Trish Mendoza: Well, there you go. There are not likely to be handshakes across the aisle of the house as the question of impeachment dominates the foreseeable future.\u00a0 Mikie Sherrill: Now that we've done it, I think we need to really make sure we're conveying to the American people how seriously we take this, how sober this is. This is not a happy time for us.\u00a0 Will Hurd: There are many people that look at the whistleblower complaint as an example of why there should be impeachment. And the other side wants to look at this as exoneration of what the administration is doing. What I want to do is understand the truth. Produced by Nicole Young and Henry Schuster.

            "article_content": "Kabul, Afghanistan \u2013 The groom whose weekend wedding here was obliterated by a suicide bombing that killed at least 63 people says he has \"lost hope.\" Both the bride and groom survived and, in an emotional interview with local broadcaster TOLOnews, the distraught groom said their lives were devastated within seconds. The British Broadcasting Corporation quotes Mirwais Elmi as telling TOLOnews he remembers smiling guests whose bodies wound up being carried out. \"My family, my bride are in shock, they cannot even speak. My bride keeps fainting. \"I've lost hope. I lost my brother, I lost my friends, I lost my relatives. I will never see happiness in my life again. \"I can't go to the funerals, I feel very weak. ... I know that this won't be the last suffering for Afghans, the suffering will continue,\" he said. According to the BBC, the bride's father told Afghan media 14 of his family members lost their lives in the late Saturday night attack. There were children among the dead and the attack wounded close to 200 other people. Fresh violence was reported Monday as a series of explosions struck the eastern city of Jalalabad. An Afghan official told CBS News' Ahmad Mukhtar at least 82 people were wounded, four of them critically and 23 of them children. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.\u00a0 Details have yet to emerge on Monday's blasts in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province, where both the Taliban and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are active.\u00a0 \u00a0 In Kabul, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's vowed Monday to \"eliminate\" all ISIS safe havens as the country went through a subdued Independence Day in the wake of the wedding attack. A local ISIS affiliate has claimed responsibility for that blast. Afghanistan was marking the 100th anniversary of its independence.\u00a0   Many outraged Afghans ask whether an approaching deal between the United States and the Taliban to end nearly 18 years of fighting - America's longest war - will bring peace to long-suffering civilians. The bomber detonated his explosives in the middle of a dancing crowd, and the IS affiliate later said he had targeted a gathering of minority Shiites, whom it views as apostates deserving of death. A sharply worded Taliban statement questioned why the U.S. failed to identify the attackers in advance.  Another Taliban statement, marking the independence day, said, \"Leave Afghanistan to the Afghans.\"  More than anything in its nearly year-long negotiations with the U.S., the Taliban want some 20,000 U.S. and allied forces to withdraw from the country. The U.S. for its part wants Taliban assurances that Afghanistan - which hosted al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before 9/11 - will not be a launching pad for global terror attacks.\u00a0 The U.S. envoy in talks with the Taliban, Zalmay Khalilzad, on Sunday said the peace process should be accelerated to help Afghanistan defeat the IS affiliate. That would include intra-Afghan talks on the country's future.  But Ghani on Monday asserted that the Taliban, whom the U.S. now hopes will help to curb the IS affiliate's rise, are just as much to blame for the wedding attack. His government is openly frustrated at being sidelined from the U.S. talks with the insurgent group, which regards the Afghan government as a U.S. puppet.  The Taliban \"have created the platform for terrorists\" with their own brutal assaults on schools, mosques and other public places over the years, the president said.\u00a0 More than 32,000 civilians in Afghanistan have been killed in the past decade, the United Nations said earlier this year. More children were killed last year - 927 - than in any other over the past decade by all actors, the U.N. said, including in operations against insurgent hideouts carried out international forces. \"We will take revenge for every civilian drop of blood,\" Ghani declared. \"Our struggle will continue against (ISIS), we will take revenge and will root them out.\" He urged the international community to join those efforts. He asserted that safe havens for militants are across the border in Pakistan, whose intelligence service has long been accused of supporting the Taliban. The ISIS affiliate's claim of the wedding attack said it was carried out by a Pakistani fighter seeking martyrdom.  Ghani called on people in Pakistan \"who very much want peace\" to help identify militant safe havens there.  Last month, after meeting with President Trump, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan insisted he will do his best to persuade the Taliban to open negotiations with the Afghan government to resolve the war.  Mr. Trump on Sunday told reporters he doesn't want Afghanistan to be a \"laboratory for terror.\" He was briefed on Friday on the progress of the U.S.-Taliban talks, of which few details have emerged.\u00a0 Some analysts have warned that Mr. Trump's eagerness to bring at least some troops home ahead of next year's U.S. election could be weakening the U.S. stance in the negotiations as the Taliban might see little need to make significant concessions.  In a message marking Afghanistan's independence and \"century of resilience,\" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the weekend wedding bombing \"an attack against humanity.\" It was one of many international expressions of condemnation pouring in following the attack.\u00a0",

I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION. As two hundred million Americans try to beat record heat this weekend emotions maybe hottest in Washington. As the feud between President Trump and the four Democrats known as The Squad gets even more divisive. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They call the people of our country and our country garbage. We're dealing with people that hate our country. ILHAN OMAR: We are going to continue to be a nightmare to this President because his policies are a nightmare to us. WOMAN: That's right. ILHAN OMAR: We are not deterred. CROWD (in unison): Send her back. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President's racist tweets have mobilized both sides. And Mister Trump's refusal to condemn racism chants among supporters caused concern even among Republicans. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Those are incredible people. Those are incredible patriots. But I'm unhappy when a congresswoman goes and says I'm going to be the President's nightmare. She's lucky to be where she is. Let me tell you. MARGARET BRENNAN: How and will the two parties make an effort to cool things down. Our Major Garrett sat down with Vice President Mike Pence. MIKE PENCE: I think that millions of Americans share-- share the President's frustration about sitting members of Congress engaging in that kind of reckless rhetoric. The President thought it was important to stand up to them. And-- and I'm glad he did it. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll also talk with Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney, a key member of the House leadership. Plus, 2020 Democratic contender Cory Booker weighs in. And we have a new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll that shows the shifts in the field of twenty-five. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff will join us to preview Bob Mueller's testimony to Congress this week. All that, and analysis on all the news is just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. President Trump is doubling down on his attacks against four Democratic members of Congress known as The Squad tweeting this morning that he does not believe, quote, \"they are capable of loving our country.\" In an interview at Cape Canaveral yesterday, CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett asked Vice President Pence about those \"Send her back\" chants from the President's supporters. (Begin VT) MAJOR GARRETT: Were those chants appropriate? CROWD (in unison): Send her back. Send her back.  MAJOR GARRETT: If you're unhappy with them, do you want to see them repeated? Is this part and parcel of the 2020 echo of the Trump campaign? MIKE PENCE: Well-- MAJOR GARRETT: It seems a simple question. MIKE PENCE: Well, no, Major. The President wasn't pleased about it. Neither was I. And the President's been very clear about that. But we're also not pleased about is the fact that there are four members of Congress who are engaging in the most outrageous statements. MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, but you know that this President's relationship with his supporters is as close as-- MIKE PENCE: And-- MAJOR GARRETT: --anyone has ever had in American politics. This could all go away with one simple word or a phrase or something. You have a chance to say it right now. MIKE PENCE: Well-- MAJOR GARRETT: Don't do it again-- MIKE PENCE: Major-- MAJOR GARRETT: --is that your message? MIKE PENCE: Major, the President was very clear. MAJOR GARRETT: Was he? MIKE PENCE: That he wasn't happy about it. And that if it happened again he-- he might-- he might-- he'd make an effort to speak out about it. MAJOR GARRETT: He will make an effort to speak out about it. MIKE PENCE: That's what he's already said. MAJOR GARRETT: Okay. MIKE PENCE: And I think that millions of Americans share-- share the President's frustration about sitting members of Congress engaging in that kind of reckless rhetoric, whether it be anti-Semitic rhetoric, whether it be referring to Border Patrol agents as running concentration camps and the President thought it was important to stand up to them. And-- and I'm glad he did it. MAJOR GARRETT: Can you be patriotic and oppose the President's reelection? MIKE PENCE: Of course. But what these members of Congress have been doing-- MAJOR GARRETT: Those are-- that's unpatriotic. MIKE PENCE: --referring to our country as garbage-- MAJOR GARRETT: That's unpatriotic. MIKE PENCE: --is-- it's unacceptable. MAJOR GARRETT: It's unpatriotic. MIKE PENCE: And President Trump is going to continue to stand up for America and call out that kind of rhetoric by those members. And it's time that Democratic leadership in Congress did the same. MAJOR GARRETT: But even as they say that they can stay. MIKE PENCE: Of course, they can stay. MAJOR GARRETT: Okay. MIKE PENCE: They're American citizens. MAJOR GARRETT: Okay. MIKE PENCE: But they-- they're speaking their mind. And this President has-- I think the President has spoken for millions of Americans who cherish our law enforcement community, who cherish support for Israel, who reject anti-Semitism. And every American on the left, right, center, Republican, Democrat, independent who in their heart of hearts would never say the kinds of things about this country, that these members of Congress are saying on a regular basis. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Major's full interview with the vice president will be available Tuesday on the Takeout podcast. Joining us now is the number three Republican in the House Wyoming's Liz Cheney. Good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY (R-Wyoming/@Liz_Cheney/GOP Conference Chairwoman): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the vice president say, \"next time the President might say something.\" Why doesn't the President as a matter of principle say unequivocally that non-white Americans are just as American as anyone else? Why doesn't he put this to rest? REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Well, I think you've heard him say that the chant was inappropriate. We've all said the chant was inappropriate. I think the news media-- MARGARET BRENNAN: No, he said they were patriotic-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --very patriotic. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: I think the news media really wants to make this about race. You just did it. This isn't about race. It's not about gender. It's not about religion. These members of the House of Representatives more, it's not just these four, it's also some of the candidates who are running for President on the Democratic side-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --fundamentally believe in policies that are dangerous for this nation. And as Republicans, we are going to fight against those even if the mainstream media accuses us of racism when we do that. This is about their support for-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is \"send her back\"-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: It is absolutely-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --patriotic? REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: It is absolutely wrong; it should not have happened. And we've all said it shouldn't have happened. I would really like to see the media as focused. MARGARET BRENNAN: And when the President says, \"go back\"-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: I would like to see the media as focused on the substance of what this wing of the Democratic Party is advocating because that is really dangerous for our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: You understand-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Socialism is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --the President-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --dangerous for our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: --tweeted about this this morning-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: I do. MARGARET BRENNAN: --right before we went to air. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: I do. That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President is-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: It is-- it is fundament-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --continuing this conversation. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: The President, this morning before we came on air, talked about the extent to which you know they love this nation. And I think that if you go back and you look at many of the things they have said. You saw the vice president say some of that this morning as well, talking about the nation as garbage, for example. But-- but-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But those are policies. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --I would-- I would, you know, again reiterate this election and these issues that we're talking about are fundamental to the future of this country. When you have members of Congress who are as anti-Semitic as-- as Ilhan Omar has been, when you have members of Congress who are advocating the, you know, complete elimination of the use of all fossil fuels, all air travel, the elimination of private insurance, the imposition of socialism on this country, we're not going to stand for that. We're not going to stand for policies that take freedom away from the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --American people. That's what this fight is about. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, what you're talking about there are policy differences. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not what the President was tweeting about this morning. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Listen, I think it's fundamentally-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And when he said, \"I don't believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our country.\" I know you disagree with their policies and their politics, you just made that clear. But there have been death threats against Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Margaret, that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: In April, there was an arrest-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Margaret, listen-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --because someone called-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Margaret-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --her office and said-- REP CHENEY: --there is no question-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --asked if she-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Listen-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and said he-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --there are a lot of secure-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --would put a bullet in-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Are you going to let me answer your question? MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm-- I'm asking the question-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: I-- I-- I got the question. MARGARET BRENNAN: --a bullet in her skull. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: There are-- there are-- fundamentally, this is-- this is a moment where we have to be very clear, and-- and it's really important for us to focus on-- and-- and I know you guys don't want to, you don't want to focus on the fact that there are substantive differences, you also don't want to focus on it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, I-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Wait, let me-- I let you ask me the question. This is about policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not what the President is talking about. He's not talking about policy. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: And it is-- this is-- that is not true. The President every single day talks about policy. Every single day-- MARGARET BRENNAN: \"Are they capable of loving our country\"-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Every single day, this President talks about the tremendous economic growth that we have seen since he's been in office, the tremendous job growth, the tremendous-- MARGARET BRENNAN: \"Capable of loving-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: decline in unemployment-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --our country\" has nothing to do-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: --with jobs. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: You are making-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you disagree with that sentiment? REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --my point. You are making my point for me right now. We are focused on-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you agreeing with the President or disagreeing with him? Because I'm not clear. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: The President has absolutely said that they should not have chanted \"Send her back.\" Our concern and our opposition to what these women are saying, and many other members of the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives, has to do with the fact that they are advocating policies that will destroy this nation and we will fight against it. And I think the news media, you included, ought to cover the substance. And I think it is outrageous for you to say the President doesn't talk about substance. Every single day, you can look at the evidence, you can look at the fact that this nation is stronger than-- than it has probably ever been. You can look at what the President's policies have done on economic growth. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: But you don't want to talk about that. So I do think that it would behoove you-- MARGARET BRENNAN: We would love to talk about that, and the President has talked to us about that. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: You have every opportunity, every single day, you have an opportunity-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The President this morning tweeted that they don't love their country. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: You've made that point, Margaret, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The rest of the world is also watching this, though. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Canada's prime minister said the comments made were \"hurtful, wrong, completely unacceptable.\" Germany's chancellor said these sentiments are in opposition to her impressions about the U.S. and she expressed solidarity in her words \"with the attacked women.\" The prime minister of the U.K. issued a statement condemning this, of New Zealand. These aren't members of the media, these are world leaders. Should Americans find the comments from the President acceptable? REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Margaret, listen, I know you want to continue to talk about this as though it had to do with race. I know you want to continue to talk about it, as though it had-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You think all those world leaders-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Margaret, I just let you-- I just let you-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --misunderstood everything? REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Look, I don't think the American people are going to look to foreign leaders to tell us who should lead the nation. They are not going to look to foreign leaders to tell us whether or not we should be a socialist country. Thank goodness, we won't do that. We depend upon those people who are elected. And I think that when you see the-- the Democratic members of Congress standing up and saying that they want to, you know, that-- that we have-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --concentration camps on our borders, that they want to provide free health care for illegal immigrants, that they want to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --end private health insurance, that they want to impose socialism on this country, they need to defend those policy positions and we are going to take every opportunity to make sure the American people, who are the ones that are going to make this choice-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --come November 2020, recognize the fundamental choice that we're all facing. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to you on Iran but I just do want to point out that there are two black elected Republicans who said that this was racially insensitive. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Margaret, we have many views-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And another Republican Mark Walker-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Margaret. MARAGRET BRENNAN: --said it was painful. So-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Margaret, we have all said that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --that's not the media REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Excuse me, but you-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But, on Iran--  REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Listen, you just continue to sort of put these little points out there and then move on. And every time you do it you are making the point I am making. As Republicans we are focused on substance. We are focused on policy and we will continue to do that no matter what the mainstream media attempts to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Unfortunately, now we don't have time to talk about Iran, but thank you very much-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Well you should have asked about Iran sooner because that's a policy issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: I would love to if the President tweets about it-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Great. MARGARET BRENNAN: --we certainly will cause I know you-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: He has tweeted about Iran. MARGARET BRENNAN: --have raised questions about it. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Actually he's tweeted about Iran quite a bit. Be good to cover all the President's tweets. MARGARET BRENNAN: I would love to. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Great. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Thank you  MARGARET BRENNAN: --but we have to go now to the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, who has been standing by. He joins us from Burbank this morning. Congressman, thank you for getting up early. You just heard Congresswoman Cheney there. When it comes to the issues that she says are about policy, not about race, not about politics, is that how you hear the comments-- comments from the President this morning? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D-California/@RepAdamSchiff/Intelligence Committee Chairman): No, absolutely not. I think, you know, tragically, the President has decided that racism is good politics. Racism is a good political strategy. There's a reason why he keeps returning to attacking these women of color and the rhetoric that he uses. The-- the crowd's ugly, racist chant didn't materialize-- materialize out of nothing. It came from the President's own tweet and words and incendiary rhetoric. This, of course, wasn't a one-off either. This was the same President who said they were good people on both sides of a neo-Nazi rally. This is who he is and he thinks it's a winning political strategy. And God help us if it is. I think it's a very-- it's a losing strategy. And I think we're going to see next year what a colossal losing strategy it is. And we're going to push back every time he engages in this kind of race-baiting racist rhetoric. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do Democrats need to push back more within their own party, though? As the President has said, there are members of it, four of them in particular who he is focusing on, whose language he has characterized as reckless, as anti-Semitic, he has said. Do Democrats need to do more to be more careful about their own language? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I don't think there's really any equivalence here. We're not, you know, inciting crowds to chant, \"Send them back.\" This is coming from the President. And, yes, we have a big and diverse caucus and the political views of our caucus are is reflective of the country as they are of our caucus. But that is not in any way equivalent to the kind of racist rhetoric coming out of the White House. So, look, I fully expect our members are going to be very aggressive out there. We have strong disagreements with this President-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --but we're focused on those disagreements when it comes to providing good paying jobs to people, issues like minimum wage, like trying to save access to health care while he wants to demonize four women of color and engage in this kind of bile. And, you know, it was such a tragedy last week, when we're celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of one of the greatest achievements in American history, in-- in the history, frankly, of humankind, the landing on the Moon-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --that we see one of the most tawdry moments in our history. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: The President engaging in this kind of behavior. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you-- because you this week will have a chance to ask questions of Robert Mueller, the special counsel, when he appears and answers questions about that four-hundred-page report he turned in. He's already said he's not going to go beyond those four-hundred-something pages. What is the purpose? What do you actually think you are going to learn? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, since most Americans, you know, in their busy lives haven't had the opportunity to read that report--and it's a pretty dry, prosecutorial work product--we want Bob Mueller to bring it to life, to talk about what's in that report. It's a pretty damning set of facts that involve a presidential campaign in a close race welcoming help from a hostile foreign power, not reporting it but eagerly embracing it, building it into their campaign strategy, lying about it to cover up, then obstructing an investigation into foreign interference again to try to cover up. That's a pretty damning set of facts that most American people are not familiar with and, of course, the President keeps on trying to deceive them about those facts. But who better to bring them to life than the man who did the investigation himself? We want the people to hear it directly from him, not filtered through Bill Barr, who had his own misleading characterization of it but from the man who did the work himself. MARGARET BRENNAN: Last year on this program, you said there was a very real prospect that on the day President Trump leaves office, that he would be indicted. The Justice Department, you said, would do that. This week the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York concluded its investigation into campaign finance and there were no charges there related to him. Does this prove your predictions wrong that this case is closed? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: No, not at all. I mean, it's been clear, you know, from Bob Mueller that he felt and the Justice Department feels bound by this Office of Legal Counsel opinion that you can't indict a sitting President. But he is a-- essentially, unindicted co-conspirator. He's been identified as an individual one, as the person who directed Michael Cohen to commit this fraudulent campaign scheme. And I assume that all this means, in terms of the Southern District of New York, is that the case will be reopened when he leaves office, providing the statute of limitations has not run, and the Justice Department will have to weigh whether to indict the former President. From my point of view, if the evidence supports that, he should be indicted. And it's certainly the view of the Justice Department's reflected in that indictment that Donald Trump was the one who coordinated and directed that illegal scheme. And why should Michael Cohen to go to jail, but the guy who did the direction and the coordination himself evade justice? He is not above the law. He may have a temporary reprieve while he occupies that office. But I think the Justice Department will have to seriously consider reopening the case if that's what it requires and indicting him when he leaves office. MARGARET BRENNAN: You alleged this week that the Attorney General, Bill Barr, intervened to stop this investigation or may have done that. Do you have any evidence to support that? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I haven't alleged that he did that. What I have said is that Congress ought to find out and make sure there was no intervention by Bill Barr or Main Justice to bring about, essentially, a political closure of that case. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Now, I don't know that that's the case but one of the concerns that I have had is when Bill Barr testified in the Senate, that he believes that the President could have made the Mueller investigation go away anytime he wanted if he thought it was unfair. It's logical to conclude he also feels the President can make any of these other cases go away if he deems them unfair-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --and-- and that is not our understanding, or anyone else's, of the law. The President is not above the law and we're going to do our oversight to make sure that none of these cases are made to go away to protect the President. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congressman, thank you very much. We'll be back in a minute with Senator Cory Booker. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the 2020 presidential campaign, and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, he joins us this morning from Los Angeles. Good morning to you. SENATOR CORY BOOKER (D-New Jersey/@CoryBooker/2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate): Good morning. Thank you for having me on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, you compared President Trump to George Wallace, the segregationist Democrat from Alabama. You said the President's own words were a disgusting display of racism and bigotry, are you accusing the President of being a racist? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: I'm-- I'm accusing him of being worse than that. He is somebody that is using race like a weapon to divide our country against itself. He's been using it since before he became President as a way to accelerate his gaining of political power. And the language he uses is actually language--tired old tropes that have been used by demagogues all throughout our country's history. From the know nothings who were fighting against Irish and German immigrants, literally, using some of the same language, to some of the same tactics that George Wallace was using for his own political power, literally, calling his opponents communist and the like. This President is, yet, another sad chapter, but what we have done all the time as Americans, black and white, from different backgrounds, we've always joined together and beaten those demagogues hate-- hate mongers and fear mongers and I think that's where Donald Trump will be relegated. This-- this election is not a referendum only on him, it's really a referendum on who we're going to be and who we're going to be to each other and I believe, have deep faith in this country's ability to come together and reject this type of politics, this isn't a partisan issue-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But to that point-- to that point, do you think there is any merit to the argument that Democrats need to-- to police their own ranks, that some of these progressive Democrats in the House have been reckless with some of their language? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: I mean if you're talking about the politics within our party that-- that's a lot different than someone who, literally, is calling for people, American citizens, to go home which is something that has been used as a racist trope. There's no equivalency here whatsoever. I don't care who says it. People who preach racism and bigotry for their own political power try to slice and divide this country against itself. That is something on a whole different moral plane than anything in the interdynamics of a political party. This is something that all of us and I-- I hear this from my Republican friends. This is awful, we need to reject it, we need to move beyond this as a country. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President has described this strategy though as-- as forcing Democrats like yourself to, essentially, embrace people on the more liberal side of the party who have said things that he has characterized as anti-Israel, sometimes anti-Semitic. Is this a strategy that is actually effective for the President because it's forcing Democrats like you to defend people you may or may not agree with? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Look, I will defend anybody Republican or Democrat who is attacked because of their color of their skin, because of their religion, because of their ethnicity. That's just who I am. I don't give a damn about the politics of it. Racism is racism. And to say nothing in-- in the face of it is to be complicit in that kind of language. So I don't care about politics. I care about my nation. This is not who we are. We are a place that has always-- I am, literally, sitting here as a United States senator because Republicans and Democrats stood up in the 1960s and fought for my family's housing rights-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CORY BOOKER: --and my equal rights. This is our-- this is the greatness of our country it's not what he is evidencing right now. And we have a moral obligation. MARGARET BRENNAN: But this-- SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Forget politics or political advantage to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But the politics-- SENATOR CORY BOOKER: --to reject it. MARGARET BRENNAN: --of race are also playing out in the Democratic debate stage. Certainly, you and Senator Harris have been critical of Joe Biden, the front-runner, for his past record when it comes to racial issues. So it-- this also seems to be a fault line that can be useful politically for Democrats as well. Do you think that needs to change? Is that the strategy for this next debate? Are you going to get more aggressive on that front? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Look, I'm running for President, not to use race as a strategy. I'm running for President because we have more African-Americans, for example, under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850, that there were real racial realities that we have to deal with, not because of black or white, but because of America. We're a nation where we swear oaths to the ideals of liberty and justice for all. And I know that this is a time where we talk about these things through a political lens but all of us in this country can-- can agree that it's wrong that there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or dealing drugs, but blacks are almost four times more likely to be arrested for that. And so, yeah, it is fair. The 1994 crime bill, which put mass incarceration on steroids, and, literally, that I worked to pass a bill through a divided Congress called the First Step Act to reverse things that were done in that 1994 crime bill. Yeah, I want people like Joe Biden, which he finally did, thank God, stand up and say, I was wrong, that bill did a lot of harm. So to me this isn't politics this is standing up and talking about our culture, who we're going to be, what's the soul of America. And-- and right now, we are in a difficult period where you see violent racial attacks on a rise. Since 9/11, the majority of our terrorist attacks have been right wing extremists, a majority of those have been white supremacist attacks, and now we have a President that's language is usually-- actually being used by white supremacists to justify their bigotry and hatred. So this-- there's a lot of more moral issues going on and it's not a left-right divide. It-- it's really, again, yet, another chapter that we've seen from the Know Nothings to McCarthyism to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CORY BOOKER: --to George Wallace and-- and Jim Crow. This is a moment in America, a moral moment, where we have to decide who we're going to be and are we going to confront the institutional racism and the racism being spewed from the most-- one of the most sacred offices in all of our land: the presidency of the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Booker, thank you for joining us. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you miss us on television FACE THE NATION can be seen on CBS All Access. Our network's digital subscription video on demand and live streaming service. Replays of FACE THE NATION also stream on our digital network, CBSN every Sunday at 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM Eastern. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but we'll be right back with our CBS News 2020 Battleground Tracker and our political panel. Don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We have some new polling on the 2020 campaign. But, first, we want to take a look at some results surveying Americans about the President's tweets saying that four House Democrats, quote, \"Go back\" to the countries from which they came. Joining us now are CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe and CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto. Good to have you both here. Anthony, this was explosive. It was dominating a week's worth of news headlines. What were voters telling you? ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections & Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, at top line level you could see what you might have expected, which is partisan splits on this. A majority said that they disliked the tweets; disliked what the President said. Democrats especially called the tweets racist and un-American, but Republicans said the media made too much of it. They thought the tweets were not racist. They thought the tweets were pro-American. And, you know, you could see some of the political wheels starting to turn, too. The four Democratic congresswoman referenced in the tweets are better known and unpopular among Republicans then they are among the country at large. So-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's interesting. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. You start to see maybe the President trying to rile up that base in advance of 2020. But I think if you pull back a second and then look at the context, too. In the poll, Americans told us that they feel like the country is divided along racial lines. And the-- the parties they think are almost taking sides in this. Democrats feeling that the Republicans and the President are trying to assert the-- the interest of white voters over minorities and Republicans feeling that the Democratic Party is trying to assert the interest of minorities over white voters. And so that split starts to define what we're headed into in the 2020 election and people say that they feel that the parties each represent very different views of what it means to be American. And that's kind of the context going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, is this the kind of rhetoric we're going to be hearing through this campaign? Should we just still ourselves? ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Very well could be. And it's the kind of thing that really presents a challenge to Democrats, who, clearly, want to be talking about other issues because they understand that's how the party won congressional control last year by sort of acknowledging the President, but focusing on what they would be for. But this was one of those weeks; this was one of those incidents that they simply couldn't ignore. This morning Joe Biden is out with a new video that once again amplifies his concerns about the President's rhetoric and how it could be dividing the country. Throughout the week you heard Democratic candidates out on the trail talking about it. But, interestingly, they start calling out the President a little bit for what he's doing here, and trying to remind voters that this-- there might be some other motives behind this. Amy Klobuchar, for example, repeatedly this past week kept saying he's doing this to distract you. He's doing this to change the subject and keep the focus on him instead of the issues we want to be talking to you, the voters about, whether that's health care, Social Security, the economy, whatever as a point about that. And-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm. ED O'KEEFE: --and it's one that I think Democrats will continue to make. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Let's get to where the race stands right now. Our CBS News Battleground Tracker focuses on the eighteen early Democratic caucus and primary contests starting with Iowa and up to and including Super Tuesday. In the aggregate of those early contest states, we're starting to see three distinct tiers. In the top one, former Vice President Joe Biden leads the field with twenty-five percent of voter support. Senator Elizabeth Warren has twenty percent. And behind her is Senator Kamala Harris with sixteen percent. Senator Bernie Sanders rounds out the top tier with fifteen percent support. Our second tier has Mayor Pete Buttigieg pulling at six percent, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke at four, and former HUD secretary Julian Castro at two percent. And in that third tier are all the rest of the candidates who are getting one percent of support in those first eighteen contests or last. Anthony, people are overwhelmed by the number of candidates. What do these tiers actually tell us? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, the way that you define tiers, in my mind, is you look at the candidates who are in position to get delegates because, ultimately, that's what this contest is about. They are trying to win delegates to that National Convention next summer. Well, you have to get at least fifteen percent in a state in order to get some delegates. So, that's where I think you see that top tier defined--all those candidates in position to get delegates across these early states. Now one of the things that's changed since last month when we talked to voters is that Joe Biden still leads, but it's a much tighter race now particularly in a number of these other states in Iowa, in New Hampshire. I would describe it as very fluid within that top tier. People are considering all of those candidates even if their first choice, at this point, remains Biden. MARGARET BRENNAN: And besides delegates and support, it's also about money. ED O'KEEFE: It is. It is. And our top tier actually reflects much of what the fundraising shows. With the exception of Pete Buttigieg who is the top money raiser this past quarter and is still in the mix. The important thing to keep in mind, too, first tier, second tier all of them got at least two percent. That matters because it qualifies them potentially for the September debate. You have to have at least four polls that show you getting at least two percent. So this is good news for anybody up to Julian Castro. It's terrible news for everybody else. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, what are we seeing in terms of how the candidates are starting to define themselves? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, start with this. The top issue for Democrats is health care. If there were top three issues, it would be heath care, health care, and health care. And that defines a split in the party in the sense that Joe Biden does better among Democrats who think that they are a little bit skeptical of a Medicare for All plan or they think if there is one that it should at least compete with private insurance. But the more Progressive candidates, the Warrens (sic), Harris, Sanders, all do a little bit better with voters who say either replace private insurance or asserting absolutely go with Medicare for All. And I think that the health care issue is starting to define something of a split there in the candidates. Yes, it cues to ideological lines as well where moderates, where Biden does better-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTHONY SALVANTO: --more Progressives and liberal voters, where the other candidates do better. But that's starting to where you start to see that split. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's cost not the type of coverage. ED O'KEEFE: Exactly. And-- and I think that's going to be one of the real defining aspects of this debate going forward. Especially, in those debates next week. And it's telling that you continue to hear someone like Joe Biden say, \"I'll fight anyone, Democrat or Republican, who wants to tear apart Obamacare,\" which is a signal to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris. \"You want to fight for Medicare for All, I'm going to fight you because the system we have is working. It just needs to be more affordable and expanded.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: And on the word \"fight,\" Anthony, you saw something really interesting here when it comes to perceptions of strength. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. We asked which candidate had been the most strong. And Kamala Harris came out on top. On that, we asked which candidate would fight a lot for people like you. And Elizabeth Warren, and some extent, Harris and Sanders also did better than Joe Biden. So you start to see this difference in what voters are perceiving is passion and enthusiasm. And you start to see that among people who are active on Twitter, active on social media. And that's the more engaged part, the more liberal part of the base. And that's perhaps to be expected, it's still early stage where you definitely see splits there, whereas Biden doing better with the moderates. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony and Ed, thanks very much. And all of you can see the full results of our CBS News Battleground Tracker, including state-specific polling on our website at cbsnews.com. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our political panel for some analysis. Lanhee Chen is a policy expert and fellow at the Hoover Institution, Rachael Bade covers Congress for The Washington Post, Jamelle Bouie is a CBS News political analyst and a columnist with The New York Times and Paula Reid is a White House correspondent here at CBS. Good to have all of you here. You heard health care, health care, health care. That's the main issue for all voters. That is not what anyone is talking about this week. Lanhee, we are talking about what the President continued to tweet about this morning--racism, The Squad, and that dispute. Why is the President continuing it? LANHEE CHEN (Hoover Institution/@lanheechen): Well, I mean, I think he believes, he feels it's part of an electoral strategy. And I think that the trumpification of the Republican Party is complete. And I think you're seeing that in terms of the degree to which he is able to consolidate Republican support and how few Republicans really came out this week and-- and took issue with the President's remarks. I think that demonstrates a degree to which he does consolidate that base. And going forward the question for the President is how does he continue to drive up that support amongst his base; and, potentially, expand his base not to independent voters, not to suburban women but to the kinds of people who would, you know, sort of enjoy the appeal, this sort of blatant appeal to race that the President's engaging in. And it's all about the 2020 election and it's all about expanding and consolidating that base. MARGARET BRENNAN: So race is front and center in 2020, Jamelle, and the Democratic candidates on the last debate stage made it racial politics front and center, as well, in the attacks on Joe Biden and his record. Is it dangerous to use this as a political tool? JAMELLE BOUIE (The New York Times/CBS News Political Analyst/@jbouie): I think it's important to distinguish between what we saw on the Democratic stage and what the President is doing. I think what we saw on the Democratic stage was an attempt among Democrats to sort of reckon with the legacy of their party's history, Joe Biden's history, specifically, but, largely, an attempt to win back certain voters by white suburbanites, non-white-- non-college white-- white workers by triangulating on issues like desegregation, on crime, on welfare and trying to move away from that as the party becomes more diverse, as the party relies even more on African-Americans and Latinos and Asian Americans versus what the President was doing is trying to summing up the same kind of fervent energies from the 2016 campaign to drive up support among his base. I think it's important to say that those kind of remarks are very unpopular with the public at large. The President saw his approval drop to a not a all-time low but close to it after Charlottesville. The remarks about football players kneeling were not popular. The Virginia gubernatorial election was practically a lifetime ago in 2017. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JAMELLE BOUIE: But the Republican candidate Ed-- Ed Gillespie suffered at the polls for leaning into those kinds of attacks. So while the President may believe it's effective the actual evidence on display is that it's probably not that effective for him. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it energizes people, Rachael, right? And it energizes the parties. And, yet, you did see some Republicans, as you say, Lanhee, not very vocally but indicate they weren't totally comfortable with this. RACHAEL BADE (The Washington Post/@rachaelmbade): Yes. Put-- put Trump aside for a second. You look at your traditional congressional Republicans. I mean, Liz Cheney in your interview, she might not have wanted to admit it and she was just sort of blaming the media but they really have a problem here. And they have been talking about it privately. It is one thing, and Republicans all agreed and Democrats would say they did have a strategy here to-- to single out these four women and talk about their policies and the fact that they support socialism or socialistic agendas of some sort. Independent voters don't like that and Republicans could really use that to their advantage. But what Trump did this week is he totally upended this tragedy by making it about race, by sending those racist tweets, the-- the chant that followed us, \"Send her back.\" That Republicans, they knew that that changed everything. And while they didn't come out publicly and say, \"Trump, you can't tweet like this,\" they confronted Mike Pence in a private meeting just a few days ago, Liz Cheney was in the room for that, where they said, \"You need to tell the President this is not good for us and this is going to hurt us.\" And so Pence relayed that to the President. And that's why he tried to put some space between himself and that chant that broke out at the rally, \"Send her back.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. RACHAEL BADE: \"Send her back.\" But we know the President. We know that sort of he returns to his gut instinct even when people try to pull him back from what he wants to do. So, you know, the question is how long is he going to try to separate himself from that? And, you know, will he do this again? MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this morning the President's tweet was, these individuals are incapable of loving this country. Paula, how is the White House handling this? PAULA REID (CBS News White House Correspondent/@PaulaReidCBS): Well, I-- I don't think anyone here really has a true incentive to tamp this down. Because both sides are getting the foil that they want ahead of 2020. Now, of course, there are some Republicans, particularly those in vulnerable districts, who do not want to be on the defensive, who do not want to be in a position to tamp this down. But even when the President backed off, and our reporting also reflects that the vice president, some of his family members went to him and asked him to distance himself from this even when he backed off, what did he do by doing that? He kept this in the news cycle. He kept the Squad v. Trump in the news cycle, in the dialogue. So to-- to-- to your point it doesn't appear that the White House in the long term will likely change this strategy. I don't expect to see the President actually tell any of his crowds to knock it off with the chanting. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jamelle, I want to ask you about some of the language the so-called Squad, these four freshmen House Democrats. Normally, someone who's very new to Washington like this wouldn't get so much attention-- JAMELLE BOUIE: Right, right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --from the most powerful man in the city. But the words that they have used. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez referring to Border Patrol detention centers as concentration camps. Republicans have said that it's disrespectful to Jews murdered in the Holocaust. Ayanna Pressley, the congresswoman from Massachusetts, she is being called a racist because she said when speaking about elected representatives, \"we don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice, we don't need black faces that don't want to be a black voice.\" What is happening here? You know, Republicans are calling that racist. And from Anthony Salvanto's polling, people are only hearing this on political-- through a political filter-- JAMELLE BOUIE: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and digesting it that way. JAMELLE BOUIE: I mean, I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But do Democrats really have a problem? JAMELLE BOUIE: So as far as how voters are hearing and I think part of the-- the larger issue here is that politics are so partisan and so divided along partisan lines that it's difficult to sort of for a lot of people to understand things in any sort of context other than the immediate partisan battle. And so in that-- in that sense if, say, Representative Pressley's remarks get traction that maybe a problem because no one's going to try to hear it in the context that I hear it which sort of there's-- there's an old proverb that's attributed to Zora Neale Hurston, not all skin folk are kin folk, which is the idea that not everyone who looks like you necessarily has your interest in mind. This is a very common thing, very common sentiment within black communities. And that's sort of what I hear from Pressley. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JAMELLE BOUIE: And it doesn't, like, strike my ears in a racist way. But in terms of the broader political context that's going to pop up and what's going to happen and what is happening is sort of, oh, well, she's talking about race. She's talking about what people ought to believe, which is sort of obviously racist, why is she not being criticized like Donald Trump. When there is-- there are very broad, very different, very broad context with-- for what's happening from both figures. And that's hard to communicate within the-- the very narrow world of partisan politics. RACHAEL BADE: This is another reason why Republicans were really frustrated when Trump tweeted last week because if you let the Democrats sort of have their in-fighting. You know, Republicans on the Hill have loved that. You mentioned this Pressley quote, specifically, I guarantee that would have dominated coverage on Capitol Hill for at least a week with congressional black caucus members who are really upset by that quote. But Trump instead has tweet united the Democratic Party. And this in-fighting that we have seen sort of spill out on Capitol Hill and really create a problem for Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That was all put in the background. But the Democrats do have an issue in that, you know, these four really are defining what people are reading in the news around the country. And Pelosi wants to keep the focus on health care. She doesn't want to talk about Medicare for All. She doesn't want to talk about socialism. That's not good for Democrats. But, again, Trump totally changed the narrative. LANHEE CHEN: I think-- I think that's the fundamental problem is that Democrats have a little bit of this power vacuum that comes, when you have a party-- JAMELLE BOUIE: Right. LANHEE CHEN: --that's out of power from the White House. And the question becomes a definitional one, which is who speaks for the Democratic Party? Well, the answer right now is The Squad. It is not Nancy Pelosi who is doing her best to hold together a disparate caucus. It is not, interestingly enough, the presidential candidates you would think in a presidential cycle would be one of those candidates, they're doing their thing. But the polling reflects that-- that the messaging and the policy dialogue is being dominated by these four people who are vastly unrepresentative of the kinds of voters Democrats need to win if they want to win this presidential election. So they have a real problem in my mind in this disconnect between who's speaking for the Democratic Party now and how Americans see Democrats and what they need to be to win that next presidential election. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break here. Congress is about to go on summer break. So I want to talk about what they actually might get done on the other side of this. We'll be back in a few moments. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with our political panel. This week in Washington, maybe must-see TV or maybe America forgot about that two-year long investigation, Paula Reid, led by the special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian election meddling in 2016. He will be forced in many ways to answer questions. This isn't an appearance he wanted to make. What do Democrats actually think they are going to hear from him and what is he prepared to say? PAULA REID: It was so interesting to hear Schiff saying he wants him to bring the Mueller report to life. I'm not sure what that-- what that equates to, the audio version of the Mueller report? But anyone who thinks that this is going to sizzle or be entertaining or really reveal new things about this investigation, sadly mistaken. As you said, this is a reluctant witness. Special counsel Robert Mueller is just not that into us, the media. He only engaged in about two instances in the entire course of his investigation. And he made it clear in his prepared remarks, he said, \"I hope this is the last time I have to talk about this.\" So in the course of the several hours where he will be answering questions he is likely to stick to his report, to not want to go beyond the confines of that report. One area, though, I think where Democrats could potentially make some progress is on Attorney General William Barr to clarify the discrepancy before-- between the former special counsel and the attorney general because that's not in the report itself. That all happened after Barr testified. He wasn't sure if Mueller agreed with his conclusions. But Mueller sent him a letter. He called him. So I do think there is the opportunity to maybe undermine the credibility of the attorney general. But Republicans also have a huge opportunity here to address the origins of this investigation. They don't even need Mueller to say anything. Just rereading those text messages between Lisa Page and-- and Peter Strzok undermines the cre-- credibility of not only this investigation but also the Clinton e-mail one. MARGARET BRENNAN: From the FBI-- PAULA REID: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --to refresh people's memories. Rachael, Jerry Nadler was on television, the House Judiciary chairman, saying that there is clear evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors. RACHAEL BADE: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: And talking about what he expects from Mueller. Those are clear words-- RACHAEL BADE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --as to what he has in mind. Is this all about laying groundwork for impeachment? RACHAEL BADE: For some Democrats, absolutely. And that's where-- there's actually division a going into this hearing about what do Democrats actually want to get out of this. I mean, the leadership, Speaker Nancy Pelosi who is against the idea of impeaching the President, they are hoping that Mueller comes in and sort of lays out some of these instances of potential obstruction of justice, and that people see that, it hurts Trump's poll numbers. And, you know only about three percent of Americans actually read the reports. So she's hoping that people learn and this hurts Trump in 2020. Now people like Jerry Nadler who-- he hasn't come out publicly for impeachment, but, privately, he has been pushing the leadership to start. And about ninety other Democrats in the House who have called for impeachment to begin. They want this to be sort of a watershed moment to see the number of Democrats who support impeachment actually grow and potentially even independents who are on the fence on this to come around to their side of thinking. Now there's a lot of skepticism that that is going to happen. But the fact that Jerry Nadler is going on TV and saying that he is thinking Mueller's going to lay out high crimes in misdemeanor shows that Nadler is getting closer to that point even as the Democratic leadership is not. MARGARET BRENNAN: Could this backfire, Jamelle? JAMELLE BOUIE: I don't know. I mean, I think it's-- I think it's unclear. We're kind of in unchartered territory here. We haven't had, you know, the-- the last impeachment controversy trial in the 90s was happening in a very different political context, but to much-- with a much more popular President, a growing economy that the President was getting credit for. And so in that, then impeachment did hurt the opposition party. But, here, the President is manifestly unpopular. The-- what he is accused of, these are-- I think there-- there is an appetite on some Republicans and the public willing to say that the President has-- has violated norms and standards here. And it's entirely possible that pursuing impeachment in this particular instance could end up worsening Trump's position versus backfiring against Democrats. But, again, I don't-- I think it's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JAMELLE BOUIE: --difficult to say because this is a unique situation. There aren't very many guides in the past for understanding what is going to happen going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Lanhee, this is one of the last things that happens before Congress goes on-- LANHEE CHEN: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --summer vacation. Policy wise, anything in the future? LANHEE CHEN: Well, we have the debt ceiling. And, you know, again, this is sort of like the Washington-- let's go up to the cliff every couple of years because we can't stand stability. Let's figure out a way to compromise economic growth and let's figure out a way to compromise everything that potentially is going right with the economy. So they-- they're going to have to figure out the debt ceiling. Some are saying it's going to be in the context of a larger budget deal. Now that budget deal potentially I think exposes fractures on the Republican side, right? Because you have some fiscal conservatives like the current White House chief of staff who believe that that fiscal responsibility element is extremely important. Some even suggest the President's there, too, that he might want to go there in a second term. And then you've got a lot of Republicans who say, forget fiscal responsibility, it's not popular. Nobody cares about it anymore. So why worry about it. So those divisions I think are going to be very real. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. LANHEE CHEN: And, clearly, it's to the benefit of the President to keep this situation put off until after the election. So there is huge incentive to get a deal done. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thanks to all of you. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, portions of which aired Sunday, June 30, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, thank you for joining us. North Korea continues to develop nuclear weapons.\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: They didn't make a serious diplomatic offer when President Trump last met with Kim Jong Un. Should he be meeting with him again? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: There's no downside to keep trying. They haven't exploded a bomb. They haven't tested any ICBMs in a quite a while. So, I would encourage the president to keep talking. But the point is to get irreversible, verifiable denuclearization of the peninsula. That's the goal. And if Trump thinks he can do this by continue to engage Kim Jong Un, let's give it a try. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about China. President Trump had a meeting with Xi Jinping at the G20 and he seemed to make a concession by no longer banning American companies from selling goods to Chinese tech firm Huawei, which the U.S. has said is a national security threat and could be used to spy. So, is the president taking them off the blacklist something he should be doing? SEN. GRAHAM: Well it's a lot of leverage because Huawei is a huge Chinese company, and it really is owned by the Chinese government, it's not a private sector company as we would know it. Microsoft came into my office trying to make sure that they could sell some technology to China that would not compromise our national security. So I don't know what he agreed to regarding exceptions to the ban. If they're minor exceptions, that's okay, but if we're selling Huawei major technology, that would be a mistake. So I don't know. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't worry that this is too much of a concession on national security grounds? SEN. GRAHAM: I don't know yet. It's clearly a concession. There's some type equipment we could sell to Huawei and other Chinese companies that would not hurt our national security. But there's a reason that Huawei has been on the- on the banned list. It is a Chinese company owned by the Chinese government deeply controlled by the military that could be used to hijack technology, data and- and steal trade secrets and other things. So, I don't know the nature of the exception. There'll be a lot of pushback if this is a major concession. If it's a minor concession, I think it's part of the overall deal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, we're speaking to you where you are, in Turkey, which is a NATO ally. We know President Trump did meet with President Erdogan-- SEN. GRAHAM: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --at the G20 as well, and he seems to have the impression that President Trump said there will not be U.S. sanctions if Turkey goes ahead and buys Russian made weapons systems.\u00a0 Is that the case? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I'm in Turkey and it's being reported in the Turkish media that President Erdogan is claiming that President Trump, in their discussions, told Turkey that if you activate the S-400, we'll find a way around sanctions. I doubt if that conversation occurred. It's impossible- under our law, if Turkey buys the- activates the S-400 missile battery they bought from the Russians, sanctions would be required under law. And we also, a couple of days ago, passed legislation banning the sale of the F-35 to Turkey if they activate the Russian S-400 missile battery. There's no way we're going to transfer to Turkey the F-35 technology and let them buy a Russian missile battery at the same time. It would compromise our platform. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're not saying sanctions are inevitable at this point. You see a way around them, some kind of compromise? SEN. GRAHAM: I hope so. Turkey's a strategic ally. They've helped us in Syria. They're a NATO ally, but they cannot have an S-400 Russian missile battery. President Trump's right that the last administration probably was too hard. They should have sold them the Patriot US missile battery to protect Turkish airspace. The way around this is to get the- Turkey to back off activating the S-400, replace it with a Patriot missile battery that is NATO compliant. I don't want a conflict with Turkey. They're a very important ally, particularly when it comes to Syria and the region. But under our law, there is no discretion. If they activate the S-400 Russian missile battery, they will be sanctioned under U.S. law and the F-35 technology cannot be transferred to Turkey. We need to find a way out of this dilemma. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sure you saw that video of Presidents Putin and Trump seeming to laugh when asked about election meddling. Did that concern you?\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. What concerns me is are we gonna be ready for their meddling next time. I've seen this administration up their game. In 2018, we had a midterm election without a whole lot of interference because we're- we're upping our game, so to speak. So it was clearly a joke. But the- the key to this is to continue to punish Russia so hard based on what they did in 2016 they will not do it again in 2020. And I can say this about the Trump Administration: they've level- leveled more sanctions against Russia than anybody. And one of the reasons Turkey can't buy the S-400 from Russia is because the law we passed. MARGARET BRENNAN: But last time you were on this program you said Russia did not learn its lesson. So when you see this joking about something so serious regarding an upcoming election, doesn't that counter everything-- SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in terms of a hard line the rest of the national security community is trying to send? SEN. GRAHAM: I'm not so sure rebuking Putin in- in front of a bunch of cameras does much good. What hurts him is when you hit him in the polit- pocketbook. His oligarch friends are having a hard time placing their money around the world. We put tremendous sanctions on the Russian economy, particularly in the energy area and it's biting Russia. So actions mean more than anything in this part of the world. So, I'm pleased with what the administration's done regarding Russia, and we need to send an unequivocal signal that if you try in 2020 what you did in 2016, the worst is yet to come regarding Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that President Trump embracing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman undermines the US credibility on human rights? SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I don't think it helps. I led the effort to sanction M.B.S., the Crown Prince. There is no doubt in my mind that he ordered the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, that he knew about it, that he's done things like that to other people and that he's been a disruptive force throughout the region. That his behavior is unacceptable, and while Saudi Arabia has been a strategic ally, I choose not to turn my back on a ally who chops a man up in a consulate, violating every international norm. So, I'm in a completely different place when it comes to MBS. The president has a different job than I do, but, I think a majority that Congress, Republicans and Democrats are not going to accept business as usual with Saudi Arabia as long as MBS is around.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been warning about Iran potentially restarting its nuclear program. Are you concerned that Israel would potentially carry out a strike that would draw the U.S. into a conflict?\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: The ball- the most likely war would be between Israel and Iran if the Iranians started to reprocess and enrich beginning July the 7th in a manner that would accelerate their path to a bomb. Israel cannot tolerate a nuclear armed Iran. The world should not tolerate a nuclear armed Iran. And I hope the president understands that if they begin enrichment on July the 7th, that he needs to get ready to send the strongest signal possible that this cannot be tolerated. I don't mind the Iranians having a nuclear power program. I don't mind the Arabs having a nuclear power program, but none of them should be able to make their own fuel, enrich or reprocess uranium. There are 50 nations that have nuclear power that do not enrich and reprocess. I would put Iran and the entire Arab world on that list. Nuclear power? Yes. A pathway to a bomb? No. And Israel cannot risk the consequences of a breakout by the Ayatollah- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: -- who has sworn to destroy the state of Israel. And when he says \"Death to Israel,\" I think he means it, and I believe people in Israel believe he means it.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But enriching, as you say, doesn't necessarily mean you're moving towards a bomb. Do you know what President Trump's red line is in terms of what Iran does with its nuclear program? SEN. GRAHAM: The reason the president got out of the JCPOA is that after 10 years there are no limits on the enrichment reprocessing capabilities of the Iranians. Again, there are 50 nations throughout the world that have nuclear power that don't make their own fuel. The way you make a bomb is you enrich and reprocess, going- but the difference between nuclear grade fuel and a bomb is a matter of months. So, what I think the president should do is offer the Iranians and the Arabs the same deal. One, two, three agreements for the entire region- Arab and Iranian region where you can have nuclear power you get your fuel from the Russians and the Chinese, the Iranians can and we'll provide it to the Arabs. That's the only good outcome I think. And I think anything less than that is going to lead to an Iranian breakout, and that puts Israel in a really bad box. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Here at home, I know you've been working with the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and some Democrats as well to try to find some compromise around asylum laws. The president said that he will go through with rounding up migrants after-- SEN. GRAHAM: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the July 4th holiday. What's happening? Do you see any legislative compromise? SEN. GRAHAM: Yes, I do. I spent about an hour with Speaker Pelosi and here's the compromise: we'll start turning the aid back on to Central America. Without investing in Central America, this problem never stops. It is in our national security interest to help the triangle- Northern Triangle nations with their economy, with their rule of law problems. But if you don't turn off the magnets that attract people, which is our asylum laws, if you don't reform them, they'll keep coming. All you have to do is to put one foot on the United States soil, if you're from Central America with a small child, you're not going to get deported. They're advertising all over Central America, \"Pay a coyote, pay a smuggler, get to America. If you bring a small child you're never going to go- be sent back.\" We need to change those laws and we also need to invest in Central America. To me that's the deal. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, on that question of children, it- it was that image of that El Salvadorean father who drowned along with his 2-year-old daughter that really captured-- SEN. GRAHAM: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --a lot of attention this week. That was his child. That was not a tool to exploit the asylum system.\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: By warning that asylum is going to get tougher-- SEN. GRAHAM: Can I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --and saying that the border might close, doesn't that incentivize people that take the risk in the first place? Doesn't that turn people towards trying to come to the United States, rather than dissuade them? SEN. GRAHAM: Good question. Here's what I think, and I don't know and it does break your heart to see that image and the thought that went into it. Here's what I think the father believed:\u00a0 \"If we can just make it across the Rio Grande, and I can put one foot in America, my child and myself are gonna be in America and we're not going to get sent back.\" I would like that asylum claim to be made in Mexico at a U.N. center so that this father doesn't have to risk him and his child drowning in the future. Asylum claims should be made in the home country or in a facility in Mexico because the reason he tried to go across the river- he was told by people in Central America, \"If you can put one foot on American soil, you're home free.\" And this is a tragic result of that policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to quickly ask you about your friend, Joe Biden. How do you think he performed in the Democratic debate this week? SEN. GRAHAM: He's got to up his game. But anybody that knows Joe Biden, there's not a racist bone in his body. That's not a clich\u00e8, that's reality. But the narrative is that maybe it's not his time and that he's not up to the task. I think you will esti- underestimate Joe Biden at your own peril. I watched the debate. The policy options being presented to the country by the leading contenders on the Democratic side are their biggest problem. Pretty liberal, pretty extreme. But when it comes to Joe Biden, I think the next debate, he's got to change the narrative. And one thing I'll say about Kamala Harris, and I said this before, she's got game. She is very talented, she's very smart and she'll be a force to be reckoned with. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, thank you very much for your time.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of CBS News Political Correspondent Ed O'Keefe's interview with Sen. Kamala Harris in Columbia, South Carolina. ED O'KEEFE: Let's start with Iran. The president apparently decided at the 11th hour to not attack because he thought it would be a disproportionate response. Should you Democrats be giving him credit for not having done that, because it would have been disproportionate? SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS: \u00a0I don't believe that anyone should receive credit for a crisis of their own making. And, there is no question in my mind that the current occupant of the White House, President Trump, put in place a series of events that led to that event. And- and we should take seriously what people who have been doing this work for a long time have told us, which is that the president's actions have been erratic and irresponsible. ED O'KEEFE: How would a president Harris fix the problem? SEN. HARRIS: Well frankly, I- I believe that we need to get back into the Iran nuclear deal. I- I- I would- I would strengthen it. I would include ballistic- ballistic missile testing. I think that we can strengthen what we do in terms of monitoring and verification, of- of progress. But there's no question that a- a- a lot of negotiation with a great deal of depth took place over a long period of time to reach that agreement, and it was- it was an agreement that was being complied with by all parties. And so under a Harris administration, we would attempt to get back into the agreement, and again, strengthening it, but understanding that we are in the best situation when we are working with our allies and are able to monitor Iran's activities, and- and do it in a way that requires full compliance with our standards. ED O'KEEFE: You're on the Senate Intelligence Committee.  SEN. HARRIS: Yes.  ED O'KEEFE: Where do you rank Iran in terms of threats to the United States? SEN. HARRIS: I am on the Senate Intelligence Committee. On a very consistent basis, I receive classified briefings about the threats to our nation's security. And I can tell you that we live in a dangerous world and that we have to take seriously any possible and potential threats to our nation. And on the list of- of potential threats, especially in terms of nuclear threat, North Korea is of course on that list, and Iran is on that list and there are others. But we have to conduct ourselves in a way that we are smart about what we do to have one and one goal only, which is ensuring that our nation is secure. And it cannot be the goal to- to express one's ego and to engage in gamesmanship without much serious regard to the consequence, and I think that's what we've seen in this president. ED O'KEEFE: So who's our greatest global foe? SEN. HARRIS: I would- I would present the question differently which is, what is our greatest political our- our- our national security threat? ED O'KEEFE: What? SEN. HARRIS: I would say that cybersecurity is one of the highest in terms of what should be a concern. Cybersecurity on a number of levels. We've seen what happens in terms of how we can face cybersecurity threats as it relates to Russia's interference in the election of the president of the United States remembering, of course, that our elections infrastructure has been designated as critical infrastructure for our nation. When we talk about it in terms of the energy grid, when we talk about it in terms of the vulnerability of our financial systems, all of which are vulnerable to attack. In fact, I have a bill, that is a bipartisan bill, with a Republican Senator, James Lankford from Oklahoma to- to- to- to secure and- and better secure our elections infrastructure. But the Republican leadership will not put it on the floor for a vote. And there are some indications it's because the president won't sign that bill. So, you know, I think that when we talk about the greatest threats to our national security there are ways that we can address them but instead, this president wants to focus on creating conflict where none exists. He wants to incite fear in the American public which is what he has done and when he continuously has talked about this multibillion dollar wall which, by the way, will not get built. And- and- and we need to do better and we can do better, which is why I'm running for president.  ED O'KEEFE: President- I'm going to do this once here and see if this helps. SEN. HARRIS: Poor guy.  ED O'KEEFE: I know it's fine, you're worth it. See, so, just remember this one day. SEN. HARRIS: Okay. ED O'KEEFE: The president is set to meet with Vladimir Putin at the G-20. Would you meet with him if you're president? SEN. HARRIS: It depends. I mean listen, I believe that we do have to have open lines of communication, and I will never foreclose that as- as- as a viable option. But let's be clear about this president's relationship with Russia, the press- the current president of the United States has taken the word of the Russian president over the word of the American intelligence community. The current president of the United States has taken then- on the issue of- of the election in 2016. The current president of the United States takes the word of a North Korean dictator over the word of the American intelligence community when it comes to an American student who was tortured and later died. The current president of the United States takes the word of a Saudi prince over the word of the American intelligence community when it comes to a journalist who was assassinated, a journalist who has an American credentials. So, I would not do that. I trust the intelligence community-- ED O'KEEFE: But you might have to meet with Putin.  SEN. HARRIS: --of the United States. But it would not be without an appropriate amount of one, reading the briefing book. Let's start there. Sadly that we even have to talk about that as being a requirement. It would not be without meeting with leaders in our Department of State. Me- meeting with our military leaders to determine what is the smartest and best course of action for the United States. These are not just about relationships that are based on some- some trust that are re- maybe previous relationship that that president has with the president of Russia it has to be based on what is in America's best interests not self-interest. ED O'KEEFE: Trump administration's on the verge of rounding up immigrant families across the country. If one of those families is watching or listening, what's your message to them right now? SEN. HARRIS: My message to them is that you are not alone and we stand with you. And there are those of us who will fight for you and your rights every day. My message to them is do not live in fear. You are not alone and America's values are such that we do not condone, as an American value, putting children in cages. America's values are not that we separate families and take children from their parents. And I would tell them that a new day is coming. We got to get beyond this election, but that we as a nation are better than this. Because I'm going to tell you, the re- reason I say all that is that I know how this is going to play out. And I know what's been happening since the beginning when this president was elected, which is these immigrant families have been further pushed into living underground to living in the shadows. That's not reflective of the civil society. ED O'KEEFE: If ICE comes looking for them, should they hide? Should they stay in the shadows? SEN. HARRIS: Listen, I'll tell you what they're going to do. I'll tell you what they're going to do because it's already happened. Children will not want to go to school out of fear that if they go to school, they will come home and their parents won't be there because they will have been picked up and deported. There will be children and parents will not send those children to the pediatrician for fear that if they walk into a hospital, they will be deported. What will happen is is a victim of rape, or child molestation, or fraud will not wave down a police officer in the middle of the street for fear that if they have that contact, they will be deported. These are the things that will happen. These are the things that will happen.  ED O'KEEFE: Those thousands in detention facilities along the border. If they're still there. You take office. What happens to them? SEN: HARRIS: Well first of all it's about understanding why they're there. And the majority of them are there because they have fled murder capitals of the world. And I think it's very important that when we think about this issue, we understand it in the context of real people and what they are experiencing. ED O'KEEFE: So how-- SEN. HARRIS: --And-- ED O'KEEFE: --how do you treat them once they're here? SEN. HARRIS: What you do is you give them the benefit of a process that we put in place a very long time ago anticipating that there will be people around the globe who will flee harm who will flee danger and arrive at our shores. And we put in place a process because we said as Americans we have strong arms. That will embrace those who are being hurt. So we put in place a process to hear their stories to determine the legitimacy of their stories and if their story is legitimate to give them a place of refuge and safety. And as president of the United States I will make sure that is a real process so that we can hear their claims and if they are deserving of protection, we will give it to 'em. ED O'KEEFE: But they wouldn't be released from those detention facilities the moment you take office. SEN. HARRIS: Well, no, listen, I- there has to be a process in place. But let's be clear, I mean we can get into the details of this part of what we had under the previous administration, which worked actually better than what's happening now, is we had a process where people would- would be released from custody with an order to return but they would go to these these family centers and actually it had a 90 something percent rate of return. So, let's again figure out what the goal is. Is the goal to try to put people in cages? Or is the goal to make sure that we have a process by which we make sure that those who deserve safety and refuge that they receive it and those who don't? If there are any who are trying to game the system then, they don't receive it. ED O'KEEFE: Let's talk about Joe Biden. SEN. HARRIS: Ok.  ED O'KEEFE: You've criticized him for praising his ability to work with people who had very different views. SEN. HARRIS: No, that wasn't my criticism.  ED O'KEEFE: What was your criticism? SEN. HARRIS: Because- I- I- I applaud any effort to work across party lines around common goals and common interests. And, in fact, I'm proud that two of my most significant legislative efforts and successes in the United States Senate are both bipartisan. So, I- I believe it is very important, it is critical for the health and for the well-being of our nation that we find common ground  ED O'KEEFE: What bothered you? SEN. HARRIS: Praising and coddling individuals who made it their life's work and built their reputation off of segregation of the races in the United States. That's a problem. I would not be a member of the United States Senate if those men that he praised had their way. I wouldn't.  ED O'KEEFE: And one of the things they did is, and he inferred this, is they might have called someone like him who was younger, son, they might've called a black man, boy. And that's been part of the issue for a lot of African-Americans-- SEN. HARRIS: --Of course it is, of course it is--. ED O'KEEFE: --we've talked to here and across the country, is that offensive to you? SEN. HARRIS: We cannot be ignorant of the history of race in this country. And certainly anyone who is a leader should not be. That is a very loaded term, loaded with a history that includes extreme racism, violence. Discrimination prejudice you name it. All of that it's a very loaded term. And I think it is very important that we all who. Who are leaders, or profess to be leaders that we choose our words carefully understanding the significance and the power of our word.  ED O'KEEFE: Can you recall a time in your past in the workplace where someone might have used that kind of patronizing or derogatory language with you? SEN. HARRIS: To call me boy?  ED O'KEEFE: Well not boy- not boy, maybe something else. SEN. HARRIS: Not in- not in- not in the not directly in the workplace. No not directly.  ED O'KEEFE: You said a few weeks ago, you were being asked this chatter about you being Biden's running mate and you said well he's perfectly qualified to be a running mate.  SEN. HARRIS: Yes he is. ED O'KEEFE: In light of these comments though, if you were looking at someone's record, would it disqualify him? SEN. HARRIS: I- I've got to win first, and then we can have this conversation. ED O'KEEFE: You- You have said that the House should start impeaching- impeachment proceedings-- SEN. HARRIS: --Yeah--  ED O'KEEFE: -- on the president. He says now his campaign manager told us that they think that will help him get reelected. Is that a risk democrats can afford? SEN. HARRIS: It is certainly a risk. I wouldn't doubt that. I don't doubt that. I think that there is, however, no question that if you've read the Muller report, which I have, it clearly outlines at least ten, one would argue eleven, counts of obstruction of justice and further, that Bob Mueller has told us, in many ways, I believe, that the only reason he did not return an indictment of Special Counsel is because of a Department of Justice memo that says the sitting president cannot be indicted. But if you also go on to read what's in these documents and including that memo, you will know that it leaves open explicitly the right of Congress and perhaps the duty, even, of Congress to act. And the way Congress then must act, is to take a look at this and open an inquiry into what exactly was the conduct and whether there should be accountability for that conduct. And so this, I believe, is a matter that is about fighting for the integrity of the system of our democracy which was designed, specifically with checks and balances, to ensure that there would not be an abuse of power.  ED O'KEEFE: But if it cost your party power? SEN. HARRIS: Well this is- this is the existential question. You're exactly right. You're right. This is the tension. This is the tension which is, do you stand to fight for these principles that were part of the- the spirit behind the design of our democracy, checks and balances, accountability? Or do you stand with strategy which is what is the ultimate goal and if it's saying that this guy should not be in office and if this could hurt the chances of winning an election, should you hold off? This is a tension and I think each person is going to have to make a decision about where they stand. I have chosen to stand with the position that I believe the- the proceedings should begin. ED O'KEEFE: You're gearing up for your first debate. We talked a little bit about this earlier.  SEN. HARRIS: Yes. Yeah.  ED O'KEEFE: How are you preparing? SEN. HARRIS: Well I'm here in South Carolina. I'm talking with folks and listening to them more than I'm talking I hope, and I'm getting a sense of what is on people's mind. You know my whole- the way that I think about issues frankly you know another a lot of people who talk about it in terms of what is your ideological perspective what is- is you know this intellectual kind of debate about what kind of Democrat are you. Well let me just tell you the way I think about the things that are my priorities are you know what I call, you know, my three o'clock in the morning agenda. What are the things that wake people up in the middle of the night? Because these are things that have been weighing on him and they just can't get to sleep. And those are the priorities I have and so it's through that lens that I think about issues like health care issues like what people need to get through the end of the month and be able to pay their bills which is why I'm proposing what has been considered one of the most significant middle class tax cuts in generations. It's the things that keep us up at night in terms of making sure that their kids are gonna be safe at school and not have to worry about a mass shooter. These are the issues that I think about based on, again, what I call my three o'clock in the morning agenda. And, so. ED O'KEEFE: But do you line up nine of your aides and say let's practice ten people on stage. SEN. HARRIS: Well I think we will do that. We haven't yet. So- but, you know I will be I'll be working on it. That's for sure.  ED O'KEEFE: What do you think is one of the biggest misconceptions about you? SEN. HARRIS: Huh. I'll tell you who I believe myself to be and who I am.  ED O'KEEFE: But there's got to be something you're hearing.  SEN. HARRIS: Well, you know, I mean I think that people are curious about my background as a prosecutor. And I think also though that we're clearing the record on that. You know, I'm a daughter of parents who were active in the civil rights movement. I experienced bias in terms of the criminal justice system growing up. It's not something I learned in school, it's not an intellectual point for me. And so when I made a decision to become a prosecutor was a very conscious decision and it was a decision that I made believing that what needs to be reformed can also be done from the system and be done inside where the decisions are being made. And I also decided to become a prosecutor because, frankly, I feel it I feel a very strong sense of responsibility to protect people and in particular protect the most vulnerable and voiceless. And so I'm proud of my record I'm proud of starting one of the first reentry initiatives in the country focused on low level drug offenders and getting them jobs and counselling and dismissing the charges against them so they could go on to live a productive life. I'm also proud of my record of having successfully prosecuted predators including rapists including murderers including the biggest banks of the United States around the foreclosure crisis including taking on pharmaceutical companies. So I think that if there's any question of the reason that I do what I do probably one of my strongest instincts and and reasons for doing a lot of what I've done in my life has been to protect people. ED O'KEEFE: You- you take your prosecutorial record against the push in your party for criminal justice reform. There's a lot of concern among, especially more liberal and younger parts of the party, you may not be the best person to do that given that you were implementing those tough on crime initiatives. As a prosecutor can they trust you to do that?  SEN. HARRIS: Well, here's the thing. When I became a prosecutor and when I was elected district attorney and also Attorney of General California I implemented some of the most significant reforms to date during those years that had been implemented. Like I said I- I created one of the first reentry initiatives. It became a model. It was designated as a model in the United States for what law enforcement should do to be as I call it, \"smart on crime.\" I was the first in the nation leading the State Department of Justice in California, which by the way is the second largest department of justice in the United States, to require my agents to wear body cameras. I created as attorney general the first in the nation implicit bias and procedural justice training for law enforcement knowing that that had to be addressed which is the implicit bias that exists in law enforcement and the potentially lethal outcomes that occur from that.  ED O'KEEFE: So the concerns are overblown?  SEN. HARRIS: The concerns are overblown, yes, no question. ED O'KEEFE: As we wrap up-- SEN. HARRIS: Yes.  ED O'KEEFE: You talked about 3 a.m., but let's talk about you for a second. Lying in bed at night, going to bed-- SEN. HARRIS: \u00a0Yeah.  ED O'KEEFE: What keeps you up?  SEN. HARRIS: What keeps me up is- I'll tell you what keeps me up. Issues like these kids in cages. What keeps me up is knowing that we could be on the potential of going to war because of the ego of the current President of the United States. What keeps me up is knowing that I've met with farmers in Iowa who've got soybeans rotting in bins because of a trade policy that has not been a- protecting- about protecting working people in America, but again has been about trade policy by tweet. These are the things that keep me up at night. What keeps me up at night is that the women of our nation, as it relates to their access to reproductive health care, that that is under attack and that poor women in America may be precluded from having access to the health care they need because they don't have money to travel to another state that recognizes the dignity of women and the- the right that they have to make decisions about their own bodies. These are the things that keep me up at night.  ED O'KEEFE: You want to keep going?  SEN. HARRIS: I could keep going.  ED O'KEEFE: You sure?  SEN. \u00a0HARRIS: What else you got? What else is over there on that list, Ed? Your voice is getting \u00a0better. ED O'KEEFE: It is, see, that's the thing. I could redo the whole thing. How long have you wanted to be president. SEN. HARRIS: A year and something?  ED O'KEEFE: When was the moment that you said I gotta- I gotta do this?  SEN. \u00a0HARRIS: I think- I- I'll tell you, I seriously- it was actually presented to me as something I should seriously consider and it was after the election in 2016. ED O'KEEFE: By who?  SEN. HARRIS: I'm not telling you. (laughs)  ED O'KEEFE: Somebody important?  SEN. HARRIS: Many people.  ED O'KEEFE: Yeah.  SEN. HARRIS: Many people, yeah. Yeah. But many people.  ED O'KEEFE: So the moment you get to Washington you're already thinking about it?  SEN. HARRIS: No, I wasn't because I actually dismissed it as- It wasn't- I mean it's not been- it has not been my life's aim. I- I'm not one of the however many candidates who- who were born thinking they'd be president of the United States.  ED O'KEEFE: Is it- is it weird hanging out with nineteen, twenty other people who- who want to be president? SEN. HARRIS: I- you know, I work with many of them-- ED O'KEEFE: I know.  SEN. HARRIS: --and I like and respect them. So it's, you know, last night was the first night we've all really been together and hanging out together as a- as a group and it's great. I mean we're having you know a- a very unique experience to run for president of the United States. And- and many of us are having the same experiences which is you know probably not sleeping enough, not eating as well as we should, not spending enough time with our families as much as we would like to. So there is a shared I think bond in terms of the experience we're having.  ED O'KEEFE: Did it get awkward in there, backstage? SEN. HARRIS: It didn't feel awkward. It didn't feel awkward. No.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "A year and a half ago, 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was serving food and drinks at a restaurant in downtown Manhattan. But then she defeated one of the most powerful politicians in the House in the Democratic primary and won herself a seat in Congress. Now, she's serving up questions for Cabinet Secretaries and CEOs during Congressional hearings and promoting policies that have been embraced by Democratic presidential candidates but also criticized within her own party. Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is, like Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic Socialist. She supports universal healthcare, tuition-free public college, and massive government investment to combat climate change. She's been described as an inspiring insurgent and as an ill-informed newcomer, as the future of the Democratic party and as a potential obstacle to its success. As we first reported in January, few rookie members of Congress have put such bold ideas on the national agenda -- and stirred up so much controversy before they were sworn in.\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: There are people that say that you don't understand how the game is played.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Mm-Hmm.  Anderson Cooper: Do you?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I think it's really great for people to keep thinking that. (LAUGHTER)  Anderson Cooper: You want folks to underestimate you?   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Absolutely. That's how I won my primary. (LAUGHTER)  Winning that primary shocked the Democratic establishment, and in November, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.  Just a few days later, as soon as she got to Washington, she paid a visit to climate change activists who were occupying her party leader Nancy Pelosi's office. She was the only newly elected member of Congress who decided to drop by during the sit-in, and she called on Pelosi to create a select committee on climate change without any members of Congress who accept money from the fossil fuel industry.  Anderson Cooper: Nancy Pelosi is incredibly powerful.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: She absolutely is. And\u2014   Anderson Cooper: And you're occupying her office.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Oh my goodness, I could have thrown up that morning. (LAUGH) I was so nervous. But\u2014 I had also sat down with\u2014  with Leader Pelosi beforehand and she told me her story. She came from activism. And I knew that she would absolutely understand how advocacy can change the needle on really important issues.   Ocasio-Cortez and her allies managed to get more than 40 members of Congress to support the climate committee.   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to create it, but it's not nearly what Ocasio-Cortez had in mind. Pelosi granted the committee limited powers and did not ban members who take money from the fossil fuel industry.  For Ocasio-Cortez, it was an early lesson in congressional politics. And another one came when she defied Pelosi and voted against the speaker's new House rules, but was not joined by many other progressive Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez told us she's determined to keep fighting for what's being called a \"Green New Deal\" \u2014  a highly ambitious, some would say \"unrealistic,\" proposal that would convert the entire U.S. Economy to renewable sources of energy in just 12 years, while guaranteeing every American a job at a fair wage.  Anderson Cooper: You're talking about zero carbon emissions\u2014 no use of fossil fuels within 12 years.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: That is the goal. It's ambitious. And... Anderson Cooper: How is that possible? Are you talking about everybody having to drive an electric car?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now. What is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent possible?   Anderson Cooper: This would require, though, raising taxes.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: There's an element where\u2014 yeah. There\u2014 people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.  Anderson Cooper: Do you have a specific on the tax rate?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: You know, it\u2014  you look at our tax rates back in the '60s and when you have a progressive tax rate system. Your tax rate, you know, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be ten percent or 15 percent, et cetera. But once you get to, like, the tippy tops\u2014  \u00a0on your 10 millionth dollar\u2014  sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more.  Anderson Cooper: What you are talking about, just big picture, is a radical agenda \u2014 compared to the way politics is done right now.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Well, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country. Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like Social Security.  Anderson Cooper: Do you call yourself a radical?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. You know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.   She doesn't seem to be viewed \u00a0as a radical by her constituents in \"New York 14\" \u2013 the racially diverse, liberal, and reliably Democratic congressional district that includes parts of Queens and the Bronx. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx. Her parents had met in Puerto Rico. Her father owned a small architectural business. \u00a0Her mother cleaned houses to help make ends meet. By the time she was ready for preschool, her parents had made a downpayment on a small house in the Westchester suburbs. It was 30 miles and a world away from her extended family still living in the bronx.  Anderson Cooper: What was it that\u2014 that brought your parents here?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Schools. Yeah. My\u2014my mom wanted to make sure that I had\u2014 a solid chance and a solid education.  Anderson Cooper: Did you feel like you were living in two different worlds? 'Cause you were spending a lot of time in the Bronx with your family\u2014   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah.  Anderson Cooper: \u2014and also here.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. And just growing up that way and with my cousins, who were all my age too, feeling like we all had kind of different opportunities, depending on where we were physically located.  She did well in school, and with the help of scholarships, loans and financial aid, attended Boston University. But in her sophomore year, her father died of cancer.   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: We were really working on the classic American dream. And overnight it was all taken away. My mom was back to cleaning homes and driving school buses to keep a roof over our heads.   She moved back to the Bronx after graduating college and spent the next few years working as a community organizer and advocate for children's literacy. In May of 2017, the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her boyfriend became her makeshift campaign headquarters as she launched a seemingly improbable run for Congress. She was working as a waitress and bartender at the time. Like many members of her generation, she says, she had student loans to pay and no health insurance.   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I really understood the frustration that working people had across the political spectrum. When anybody is saying, \"The economy is going great. We are at record levels.\" There's a frustration that says, \"Well, the economy's good for who?\"  Anderson Cooper: I mean unemployment is at record lows.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I don't think that that tells the whole story. When you can't provide for your kids working a full-time job, working two full-time jobs. When you can't have healthcare. That is not \u2014  that is not dignified.  She built a grass-roots coalition that took on the Democratic machine by going door to door arguing that she could represent the district better than a ten-term incumbent who spent most of his time in Washington.  Her victory made national news, and she soon had a higher media profile than many veteran lawmakers. Some saw in her primary victory a craving for change within the Democratic Party. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi drew a more limited conclusion:  Nancy Pelosi at press conference: They made a choice in one district, so let's not get yourself carried away   But President Trump rarely missed a chance to suggest that all Democrats were socialists who'd lead the country to ruin.   President Trump at rally in Nevada: Venezuela, Venezuela how does that sound? You like Venezuela?  Anderson Cooper: When people hear the word socialism, they think Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela. Is that what you have in mind?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Of course (LAUGH) not. What we have in mind\u2014 and what of my\u2014 and my policies most closely re\u2014 resemble what we see in the U.K., in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden. Anderson Cooper: How are you going to pay for all of this?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No one asks how we're gonna pay for this Space Force. No one asked how we paid for a $2 trillion tax cut. We only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, healthcare and education. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force. For all of these\u2014 ambitious policies.   Anderson Cooper: There are Democrats, obviously, who are worried about your affect on the party. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, said about left-leaning Democrats, \"If the next two years is just a race to offer increasingly unrealistic proposals, it'll be difficult for us to make a credible case we should be allowed to govern again.\"  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: What makes it unrealistic?  Anderson Cooper: How to pay for it.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: We pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations. And so for me, what's unrealistic is\u2014 is what we're living in right now.   Since the election, some conservative media outlets have focused on Ocasio-Cortez with an intensity unusual for a rookie member of Congress.  She's been accused of being dishonest about the true cost of her proposals and the tax burden they would impose on the middle class. She's also been criticized for making factual mistakes.  Anderson Cooper: One of the criticisms of you is that\u2014  that your math is fuzzy. The Washington Post recently awarded you four Pinocchios\u2014   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Oh my goodness\u2014   Anderson Cooper: \u2014for misstating some statistics about Pentagon spending?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: If people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, I would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees. I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.  Anderson Cooper: But being factually correct is important\u2014   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's absolutely important. And whenever I make a mistake. I say, \"Okay, this was clumsy.\" and then I restate what my point was. But it's\u2014  it's not the same thing as\u2014  as the president lying about immigrants. It's not the same thing, at all.  Anderson Cooper: You don't talk about President Trump very much.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No.  Anderson Cooper: Why?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No. Because I think he's a symptom of a problem.   Anderson Cooper: What do you mean?   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The president certainly didn't invent racism. But he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things.  Anderson Cooper: Do you believe President Trump is a racist?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. Yeah. No question.  Anderson Cooper: How can you say that?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: (CHUCKLE) When you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy. When you look at how he reacted to the Charlottesville incident, where neo-Nazis murdered a woman, versus how he manufactures crises like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it's\u2014 it's night and day.   In response, the deputy White House press secretary said, \"Cong. Ocasio-Cortez's sheer ignorance on the matter can't cover the fact that President Trump supported and passed historic criminal justice reform\u2026\" \u00a0and \"... has repeatedly condemned racism and bigotry in all forms.\"  One of the few things Ocasio-Cortez has in common with the president is an active and often combative presence on social media. When a conservative writer tweeted this photo of her, saying, \"That jacket and coat don't look like a girl who struggles,\" she called him out for what she said was \"misogyny.\"  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Would you be taking a creep shot of Steny Hoyer's behind and sharing it around? Why is there more comfort in doing that to me than there is in doing it to\u2014 any other member of Congress?  Eliminating the influence of corporate money in politics is another one of Ocasio-Cortez's signature issues. Most of her campaign funds came from small donations of $200 or less. She did accept some money from labor unions, but she refuses to take any contributions from corporate political action committees. She's angered some of her colleagues in the House by encouraging primary challenges of Democrats who accept corporate money or oppose progressive policies.  Anderson Cooper: These are politically dangerous tactics that you're using... Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah\u2014   Anderson Cooper: You've heard that?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah.   Anderson Cooper: Do you believe it?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's absolutely risky. it requires risk to try something new, but also we\u2014 we know so much of\u2014 of what we've tried in the past hasn't worked, either.  Since our story first aired, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez was given seats on two influential committees - Financial Services, and Oversight. Republicans have called her proposal for a Green New Deal unrealistic and potentially ruinous to the economy. But the leading Democratic Presidential candidates have said they support the idea, though they differ on some of the details.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana that aired Sunday, June 2, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, to Republican Senator John Kennedy who joins us this morning from New Orleans. Good morning to you, Senator. You heard this week as the country did from Rob- Robert Mueller who said in front of the cameras, \"If we had confidence the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so.\" Are you confident the president did not commit a crime? SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY: Here's what I heard Mr. Mueller say this week first, \"I quit. No m\u00e1s. I've done the best I can. If you're happy with it fine. If you're not happy with it call your priest or your minister or your psychiatrist, but I'm done and I don't want to testify. Look at my report.\" I look at his report and I see the following: number one, no collusion, so no indictment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well actually he said it wasn't about collusion-- SEN. KENNEDY: Number two on obstruction of justice-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --he said no conspiracy or evidence that amounted to ability to prosecute conspiracy. SEN. KENNEDY: That's what I was going to get to- that's what I was going to get to next, Margaret. On the obstruction of justice he said, \"I'm not saying the president did it. I'm not saying the president didn't do it. I am saying I'm not going to bring an indictment.\" You can- you- you can hear what you want to hear in the report. People obviously have strong feelings about this. I have never heard-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But I'm asking what you heard. \u00a0 SEN. KENNEDY: \u00a0I have never- I've heard- I heard-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you confident the president did not commit a crime? SEN. KENNEDY: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. You reference there that you think Bob Mueller is done. He said he prefers not to come back and testify. SEN. KENNEDY: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But then some of the people who support the president including his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have said that maybe he should. In fact Giuliani was quoted by The Daily Beast saying if they allow Congressman Meadows and Jordan and a few others out there, they'll eviscerate Robert Mueller. He would love to have him testify. Former White House attorney John Dowd said something similar. Are you swayed by that at all? Do you think Mueller should testify? SEN. KENNEDY: No, not at this juncture I don't think it'll do any good. If he wants to I wouldn't object but he clearly doesn't want to. And if you make him testify he's going to say, 'Read my report.' Look the next- the next step in this Margaret, my- my Democratic friends have got to make a decision on impeachment. Now, I think impeachment will be a Sisyphean task. It'll be tough going in the Senate. Impeachment polls right up there with skim milk among the American people. But- but my advice to my Democratic friends is if you want to do it, go hard or go home. You know if you want to do it go- go to Amazon online, buy a spine and do it. But go hard or go home if you're not going to do it then let us get back to work. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- SEN. KENNEDY: I hate to waste a year and a half. MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. But in terms of moving on from the Mueller Report, you have the attorney general say he's not ready to move on when it comes to the question of the origins of the counterintelligence probe itself which to be clear was opened after a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, had some contact with Russians discussing stolen information from Hillary Clinton. So do you support the attorney general's probe here into the origins of the investigation itself? SEN. KENNEDY: Yes. And let's look at the facts. Forget the spin. In the 2016 election, the FBI, maybe the CIA, and the Department of Justice decided to investigate both presidential candidates, Secretary Clinton and then- then nominee President Trump. Now that's pretty breathtaking. And arguably those investigations had an impact on the election. I don't know whether they did or did not. I don't know how you'd prove it, but that's a pretty serious step by the FBI and the Justice Department. I'd like to know why they did it. I do believe there were some people, small handful of people at those agencies that acted on their political beliefs, either for Trump or for Clinton, or against Trump or against Clinton. And I don't want to see it happen again. I don't see the harm in looking at the facts. And in fact I've asked the president to- to- to look- look for every document at the FBI and Justice Department pertaining to the 2016 election and the investigations, properly redact them, and let the American people see them. American people figure it out if you let them see the facts. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about another issue and that is the president's decision to put this 5 percent tariff on a broad range of Mexican products to punish that country for allowing migrants across the border. Chuck Grassley, fellow Republican senator, says this is a misuse of tariff authority and congressional intent. Are you a supporter of the president's decision to do this? SEN. KENNEDY: I think it was a mistake. I'm not saying we don't have a crisis at the border. We clearly do. I'm not saying it won't work. President Lopez Obrador has already indicated that he's willing to talk, but I worry about the long-term ramifications. We have a deal with Mexico on trade. It's called NAFTA. In fact we just shook hands on a new deal. It's called NAFTA, too. When you give your word, you stick to it. And I really worry about us negotiating trade deals with other countries and whether those countries will wonder, \"Well if we- if we make concessions and trade hard and we reach a deal, will America stick to it?\" Now having said all that I don't think the president's going to impose these tariffs. My experience with the president is he's a very smart man. I wouldn't call him risk averse. He's been known to play with fire but not live hand grenades. And if- if- if he slaps a 25 percent tariff on Mexico it's going to tank the American economy. And I think the president knows that and I don't think he'll do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kennedy, good morning to you. Thank you for joining us.",

            "article_content": "President Trump left his summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, Vietnam on Thursday without any deal to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. \"Sometimes you have to walk,\" Mr. Trump said, explaining that the two leaders were unable to reach any agreement.\u00a0 But Mr. Trump is far from the first U.S. president to leave a high-stakes international meeting empty handed. Here are three other major talks that ended in failure: Just before President Dwight D. Eisenhower was set to meet with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in for a four-power Paris summit between the U.S., France, Britain and the Soviet Union, an American U-2 spy plane was shot down by the Soviets on May 1, 1960. The Soviets were able to recover the plane and took the pilot prisoner in a major embarrassment for the U.S., which believed its Cold War rival didn't possess missiles capable of taking down a U-2.\u00a0 Khrushchev used the revelation that the U.S. had been spying in the region for some time to his advantage, forcing Eisenhower to say that he had approved the flights in the hopes to avoid \"another Pearl Harbor.\" The Soviets also imprisoned the American pilot, Francis Gary Powers, who admitted that he had been on a spy mission despite initial U.S. denials.\u00a0 Khrushchev entered the talks still enraged by the controversy, and insisted Eisenhower apologize for initiating the U-2 flight program and punish those involved in any espionage. The summit came to an abrupt end on May 16, 1960 when Eisenhower refused to apologize for the U-2 flights and Khrushchev refused to meet with the president. Similar to Mr. Trump's first summit with Kim, the first meeting in Geneva between Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev laid the groundwork for a future summit in Reykjavik, Iceland in October of 1986. The leaders had exchanged letters back and forth throughout the year prior, making it seem that efforts toward abolishing nuclear weapons were a real possibility.\u00a0 \"There were a number of things that thad been discussed and left open in Geneva, such as INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces), the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty, space arms and nuclear testing. The U.S. side was especially interested in strategic arms proposals for the U.S. negotiators in Geneva. Both the U.S. and USSR would like to see a world without nuclear missiles. This was a very important issue, and the world was interested in the possibility of achieving this,\" an official U.S. memorandum of conversation of the talks provided by the Atomic Heritage Foundation reads.\u00a0 Both countries appeared to be on the brink of an historic agreement to curb or even eliminate their ballistic missile stockpiles, but the talks fell apart when Reagan would not give up his goal of developing a nuclear defensive shield commonly referred to as \"Star Wars.\" Gorbachev had pressed Reagan on limiting development of the planned Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI, which could have allowed the U.S. to shoot down Soviet missiles for space.\u00a0 According to the transcript, \"If they could agree to ban research in space,\" Gorbachev would sign a treaty drastically reducing the Soviet nuclear arsenal in \"two minutes.\" The summit ended the next day without a firm agreement in hand and leaving both leaders feeling bitter toward one another.\u00a0 Reagan's Secretary of State George Shultz recalled later to CBS News that the president was mad as he left the summit, but that the two sides had still made major strides. \"They had seen the president's resolve, but we had seen their bottom line,\" said Shultz. \"We knew they were ready to cut strategic arms in half.\" While both leaders were disappointed by the lack of an agreement at the end of the meeting, Reykjavik set the stage for future talks. During the following year's Washington Summit, the two sides agreed to ban Intermediate Range Nuclear Missiles and reduce other strategic nuclear weapons, winding down the Cold War in the final years before the Soviet collapse.\u00a0 President Bill Clinton brought together Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat for intense rounds of negotiations at Camp David from July 11 to July 24, 2000 in the hopes of finally ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u00a0 By July 25, 2000, Clinton announced that the summit had failed in brokering an agreement between the Middle Eastern nations. Barak returned to Israel blaming Arafat for the failure, saying \"we did not succeed because we did not find a partner prepared to make decisions on all issues. We did not succeed because our Palestinian neighbors have not yet internalized the fact that in order to achieve peace, each side has to give up some of their dreams; to give, not only to demand.\" The Palestinian leadership, meanwhile, declared the summit a failure due to a lack of preparation by the U.S., personality clashes between Barak and Arafat, and Israel's negotiation tactics.\u00a0 \"Israelis and Palestinians are destined to live side by side, destined to have a common future. They have to decide what kind of future it will be. Though the differences that remain are deep, they have come a long way in the last seven years, and, notwithstanding the failure to reach an agreement, they made real headway in the last two weeks,\" Clinton said at the close of the summit.\u00a0 According to a trilateral statement on the summit released by the United Nations, while the three leaders were \"not able to bridge the gaps and reach an agreement, their negotiations were unprecedented in both scope and detail.\" At the close of the summit, both Israel and Palestine agreed to open-ended commitments, including a promise to \"continue their efforts to conclude an agreement on all permanent status issues as soon as possible.\" To this day, the Middle East peace process is still a puzzle that has been left unsolved. Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been spearheading the Trump administration's Middle East peace plan, which has not yet been revealed. According to the Associated Press, Kushner has said he plans to release details of the plan sometime after Israel's April 9th election.\u00a0 Kushner has said his plan will address all \"final status\" issues, including borders, and require compromises by all sides. The plan apparently makes no mention of the creation of a separate Palestinian state but would focus heavily on offering economic \"opportunities\" to the Palestinian people.\u00a0 While the latest stab at talks with North Korea appear to have fizzled out, William Hitchcock, a history professor at the University of Virginia, says if past presidents' efforts of summit diplomacy have shown us anything, it's that real diplomacy requires \"years of patient behind-the-scenes work\" and that nations' \"tangled problems\" can't be solved with a simple handshake and the stroke of a pen. \"President Trump wanted a quick solution to a complex problem: you give up nukes, we lift sanctions. But North Korea has learned that possessing nuclear weapons gives them immense prestige and leverage in the world so they're unlikely to give them up. What's needed is a long term framework to manage nuclear weapons, and that needs to be worked out over years, not at a single meeting,\" said Hitchcock.\u00a0 He suggested that despite Mr. Trump's failure to deliver a concrete deal this time around, the meeting was still \"very important.\" \"Eisenhower, Reagan and Clinton all endured disappointments at summits but their efforts were part of managing complex and dangerous relationships. Signaling a willingness to talk is vitally important even if the final deal is elusive. Trump should be given credit for breaking the ice.\" Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham that aired\u00a0Sunday, Feb. 17, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" We have a lot to get to today and we're going to begin with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. He joins us from Germany where he is attending the Munich Security Conference. Sir I want to get right to this conversation my colleague Scott Pelley had on \"60 Minutes\" with former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe where he described a conversation about the 25th Amendment-- the mechanism through which to push the president out of office- And he said it was brought up to him by the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. MCCABE: DISCUSSION OF THE 25TH AMENDMENT WAS WAS, WAS SIMPLY ROD RAISED THE ISSUE AND DISCUSSED IT WITH ME IN THE CONTEXT OF THINKING ABOUT HOW MANY OTHER CABINET OFFICIALS MIGHT SUPPORT SUCH AN EFFORT. PELLEY: ROSENSTEIN WAS ACTUALLY OPENLY TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS A MAJORITY OF THE CABINET WHO WOULD VOTE TO REMOVE THE PRESIDENT. MCCABE: THAT'S CORRECT. COUNTING VOTES OR POSSIBLE VOTES. PELLEY: WHAT SEEMED TO BE COURSING THROUGH THE MIND OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS GETTING RID OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. MCCABE: WELL-- PELLEY: --ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. MCCABE: I CAN'T CONFIRM THAT. BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS DEFINITELY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, ABOUT HIS CAPACITY AND ABOUT HIS INTENT AT THAT POINT IN TIME. PELLEY: HOW DID HE BRING UP THE IDEA OF THE 25TH AMENDMENT TO YOU? MCCABE: HONESTLY I DON'T REMEMBER. HE-- IT WAS JUST ANOTHER KIND OF TOPIC THAT HE JUMPED TO IN THE MIDST OF- OF- OF A WIDE RANGING CONVERSATION. PELLEY: SERIOUSLY? (LAUGH) JUST-- MCCABE: --YEAH-- PELLEY: --ANOTHER TOPIC? MCCABE: YEAH. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator that's a tremendous allegation to make. Have you ever asked Rod Rosenstein if in fact that conversation happened? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: While he's publicly denied it, but, the whole point of Congress existing is to provide oversight of the executive branch. So through good reporting by \"60 Minutes,\" there's an allegation by the acting FBI director at the time that the deputy attorney general was basically trying to do an administrative coup, take the president down to the twenty fifth amendment process. The deputy attorney general denies it. So I promise your viewers the following; that we will have a hearing about who's telling the truth, what actually happened. Mr. McCabe, you remember, was dismissed from the FBI for leaking information to the press. So you've got to remember the source here. MARGARET BRENNAN: There has been some parsing though of whether these were extended discussions versus conversations about the 25th Amendment. Do you know whether those conversations have taken place? SEN. GRAHAM: No but I think everybody in the country needs to know if it happened. It's stunning to me that one of the chief law enforcement officers of the land- the acting head of the FBI- would go on national television and say, oh by the way I remember a conversation with the deputy attorney general about trying to find if we could replace the president under the 25th Amendment. We're a democracy. People enforce the law- can't take it into their own hands. And was this an attempted bureaucratic coup? I don't know. I don't know who's telling the truth. I know Rosenstein vehemently denied it but we're going to get to the bottom of it. I do know there was a lot of monkey business about FISA warrants being issued against Carter Page, about dossiers coming from Russia that were unverified. Mr. Mueller is going to look at the Trump campaign as he should to see if they violated any laws during the 2016 election. And I'm going to do everything I can to get to the bottom of the Department of Justice FBI behavior toward President Trump and his campaign. MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but by even framing it as you just did there Senator, are you concerned that by investigating the investigators you are adding to some damage of the credibility of the FBI? SEN. GRAHAM:\u00a0 Quite the opposite. If it happened we need to clean it up. The FBI has gotten off track in the past. It's one of the greatest organizations in the world. The Hoover years have proven to be pretty dark periods for the FBI. The latter part of the Hoover days where politicians were being blackmailed. There is no organization beyond scrutiny. There is no organization that can't withstand scrutiny. And the FBI will come out stronger. But we've got to get to the bottom of it. What are people to think after they watch \"60 Minutes\" when they hear this accusation by the acting deputy- acting FBI director that the deputy attorney general encouraged him to try to find ways to count votes to replace the president? That can't go unaddressed. And it will be addressed. That's what oversight is all about. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you subpoena McCabe and Rosenstein to appear? SEN. GRAHAM: How can I not, if that's what it takes? I mean you're doing your job. The first amendment allows you to ask questions of the most powerful people in the country. I know he's selling a book, and we need to take with a grain of salt maybe what Mr. McCabe is telling us. But he went on national television and he made an accusation that floors me. You know, I can imagine if the shoe were on the other foot, this would- if we were talking about getting rid of President Clinton, it'd be front page news all over the world. Well we're going to find out what happened here and the only way I know to find out is to call the people in under oath and find out, through questioning, who's telling the truth because the underlying accusation is beyond stunning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to play another clip from that interview for you. SCOTT PELLEY: WHAT WAS IT SPECIFICALLY THAT CAUSED YOU TO LAUNCH THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION? ANDREW MCCABE: IT'S MANY OF THOSE SAME CONCERNS THAT CAUSED US TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT. AND THE IDEA IS IF THE PRESIDENT COMMITTED OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, FIRED THE DIRECTOR OF THE- OF THE FBI TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT, OR TO SHUT DOWN OUR INVESTIGATION OF RUSSIA'S MALIGN ACTIVITY, AND POSSIBLY IN SUPPORT OF HIS CAMPAIGN, AS A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATOR YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WOULD A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DO THAT? SO ALL THOSE SAME SORTS OF FACTS CAUSE US TO WONDER, IS THERE AN INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP, A CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS PRESIDENT AND OUR MOST FEARSOME ENEMY, THE GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA? MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, you voiced support for the Muller probe in the past. Listening to\u2014 SEN. GRAHAM: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: What McCabe just described there- a troubling pattern of behavior that he as a- a lifetime investigator saw as a troubling fact pattern, led him to open a counterintelligence investigation into the president of the United States. Can you understand why he came to that conclusion? SEN. GRAHAM: I can understand that the American people will get an answer to the question for Mr. Mueller. What I can't understand is why Mr. McCabe would meet with Page and Strzok to discuss their hatred for president- candidate Trump, talking about taking an insurance policy out in case the election went different than they want. So Mueller will tell us about what Trump did or didn't do. I'm going to tell the country about McCabe and the people at the Department of Justice and how they behaved. Did they take the law into their own hands? Did they abuse the FISA warrant process because they had a political agenda? Did their hatred of Trump go so far, that they abandoned their role of being law enforcement agents and become advocates for a political cause? We're going to get to the bottom of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you recognize there that McCabe is laying out the- the grounds of what he saw as an obstruction of justice attempt. SEN. GRAHAM: Mr. Mueller will look at that but I think McCabe, Strzok and Page had a political bias, a political agenda. And I find it odd that the dossier that we use to get the warrant against Carter Page, prepared by a foreign agent, paid for by the Democratic Party that they knew to be unreliable, was used on four separate occasions to get a warrant. And I want to know why Comey told the president, \"Here's the dossier. We've got it. We can't verify any of it. We want you to know about it.\" And that same document was used by the FBI and the Department of Justice under oath to tell the court, \"This is reliable information, gives us a warrant based on this document. I hope your viewers understand that the rule of law works both ways. Somebody has got to watch those who watch us and I intend to watch what McCabe and- and his crowd did during the 2016 election. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president just declared a national emergency in regard to getting the funds for his border wall. In terms of getting those funds though through this emergency action and there's about three point six billion of it that could come from military construction efforts, including construction of a middle school in Kentucky, housing for military families, improvements for bases like Camp Pendleton and Hanscom Air Force Base. Aren't you concerned that some of these projects that were part of legislation that you helped approve and Congress are now going to possibly be cut out? SEN. GRAHAM: Well the president will have to make a decision where to get the money. Let's just say for a moment that he took some money out of the military construction budget. I would say it's better for the middle school kids in Kentucky to have a secure border. We'll get them the school they need. But right now we've got a national emergency on our hands. Opioid addiction is going through the roof in this country. Thousands of Americans died last year and dying this year because we can't control the flow of drugs into this country and all of his coming across the border-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Through ports of entry according to the-- SEN. GRAHAM: So the dangers presented by a broken border to me. MARGARET BRENNAN: --to Customs and Border patrol though. But-- SEN. GRAHAM: Both. It's both. It's not just one. For every one we get, God knows how much we miss. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do- don't you think Congress has ceded too much power to the executive branch?\u00a0 Do you think that you need to more sharply define what constitutes a national emergency so that future presidents can't interpret it as they like? SEN. GRAHAM: Good question. I think that every member of Congress has watched three presidents send troops to the border. Bush, Obama, now Trump. Not one of us have complained about deploying forces to the border to secure the border. It's pretty hard for me to understand the legal difference between sending troops and having them build a barrier. What disappoints me is on President Obama's watch as a Republican, I voted for a 44 billion dollar border security package, 9 billion of which included barriers. 2006 all of us voted for the Secure Fre-Fence Act. And we're talking about steel barriers not a concrete wall. And unfortunately when it comes to Trump, the Congress is locked down and will not give him what we've given past presidents. So unfortunately, he's got to do it on his own and I support his decision to go that route. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well perhaps in the future we can talk about sharpening what constitutes an emergency. But before I let you go, you made a pitch from the stage-- SEN. GRAHAM: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --there at Munich for foreign troops to be committed to Syria alongside American forces. How many U.S. forces are needed to stay there and has President Trump actually made that commitment to you? SEN. GRAHAM: Well that's- thank you for asking Margaret. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been destroyed. It has been defeated. All the work is not yet done. Remnants of ISIS are lethal. We need a follow own presence post caliphate destruction. The good news we can do this with a fraction of American forces we've had in Syria in the past. The real good news is Europeans are willing to contribute because their cities have been attacked from Syria. The caliphate in Syria-- MARGARET BRENNAN: How many U.S. troops? SEN. GRAHAM:--has caused thousands of deaths inside of Europe. I think just a fraction, a couple of hundred, compared to twenty seven hundred would be enough to get Europeans to contribute to the stabilizing force to make sure ISIS doesn't come back like it did in Iraq, to make sure that Turkey and the Kurds don't go to war, to keep them apart, and to make sure Iran doesn't come in and take over when we leave. So I've never felt better about the outcome in Syria with a small contingent of Americans. A lot of Europeans will come in and help fill in the gap, a very small down payment to secure ISIS never comes back. We've gone from thousands of troops in Iraq and Syria down now to a couple of hundred in Syria. Congratulations, Mr. President. The job is not yet done but we've done a hell of a job destroying the caliphate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, thank you.",

            "article_content": "The 116th Congress was sworn into office this past week, even as the government remained in a partial shutdown. A record number of women have been elected to the House of Representatives. So far, one newcomer is getting most of the attention, from both the left and from the right. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is 29 years old. She'd never run for elective office before and was working as a waitress and bartender when she launched her campaign. She unseated one of the most powerful Democrats in the House in the primary.  Like Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez is a Democratic Socialist. She believes in universal healthcare, tuition-free public college, and massive government investment to combat climate change. She's been described as both an inspiring and idealistic insurgent, and as a na\u00efve and ill-informed newcomer \u2014   as the future of the Democratic party, and as a potential obstacle to its success. Few rookie members of Congress have put such bold ideas on the national agenda and stirred up so much controversy before they were sworn in.  Anderson Cooper: There are people that say that you don't understand how the game is played.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Mm-Hmm.  Anderson Cooper: Do you?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I think it's really great for people to keep thinking that. (LAUGHTER)  Anderson Cooper: You want folks to underestimate you?   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Absolutely. That's how I won my primary. (LAUGHTER)  Winning that primary shocked the Democratic establishment, and in November, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.  Just a few days later, as soon as she got to Washington, she paid a visit to climate change activists who were occupying her party leader Nancy Pelosi's office. She was the only newly elected member of Congress who decided to drop by during the sit-in, and she called on Pelosi to create a select committee on climate change without any members of Congress who accept money from the fossil fuel industry.  Anderson Cooper: Nancy Pelosi is incredibly powerful.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: She absolutely is. And\u2014   Anderson Cooper: And you're occupying her office.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Oh my goodness, I could have thrown up that morning. (LAUGH) I was so nervous. But\u2014 I kept kind of just coming back to the idea that what they're fighting for wasn't wrong. And I\u2014  I had also sat down with\u2014  with Leader Pelosi beforehand and she told me her story. She came from activism. And I knew that she would absolutely understand how advocacy can change the needle on really important issues.   Ocasio-Cortez and her allies managed to get more than 40 members of Congress to support the climate committee.   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to create it, but it's not nearly what Ocasio-Cortez had in mind. Pelosi granted the committee limited powers and did not ban members who take money from the fossil fuel industry.  For Ocasio-Cortez, it was an early lesson in congressional politics. And another one came when she defied Pelosi and voted against the speaker's new House rules, but was not joined by many other progressive Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez told us she's determined to keep fighting for what's being called a \"Green New Deal\" \u2014  a highly ambitious, some would say \"unrealistic,\" proposal that would convert the entire U.S. Economy to renewable sources of energy in just 12 years, while guaranteeing every American a job at a fair wage.  Anderson Cooper: You're talking about zero carbon emissions\u2014 no use of fossil fuels within 12 years.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: That is the goal. It's ambitious. And... Anderson Cooper: How is that possible? Are you talking about everybody having to drive an electric car?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now. What is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent possible?   Anderson Cooper: This would require, though, raising taxes.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: There's an element where\u2014 yeah. There\u2014 people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.  Anderson Cooper: Do you have a specific on the tax rate?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: You know, it\u2014  you look at our tax rates back in the '60s and when you have a progressive tax rate system. Your tax rate, you know, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be ten percent or 15 percent, et cetera. But once you get to, like, the tippy tops\u2014  \u00a0on your 10 millionth dollar\u2014  sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more.  Anderson Cooper: What you are talking about, just big picture, is a radical agenda \u2014 compared to the way politics is done right now.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Well, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country. Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like Social Security.  Anderson Cooper: Do you call yourself a radical?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. You know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.   She doesn't seem to be viewed \u00a0as a radical by her constituents in \"New York 14\" \u2013 the racially diverse, liberal, and reliably Democratic congressional district that includes parts of Queens and the Bronx. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx. Her parents had met in Puerto Rico. Her father owned a small architectural business. \u00a0Her mother cleaned houses to help make ends meet. By the time she was ready for preschool, her parents had made a downpayment on a small house in the Westchester suburbs. It was 30 miles and a world away from her extended family still living in the bronx.  Anderson Cooper: What was it that\u2014 that brought your parents here?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Schools. Yeah. My\u2014my mom wanted to make sure that I had\u2014 a solid chance and a solid education.  Anderson Cooper: Did you feel like you were living in two different worlds? 'Cause you were spending a lot of time in the Bronx with your family\u2014   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah.  Anderson Cooper: \u2014and also here.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. And just growing up that way and with my cousins, who were all my age too, feeling like we all had kind of different opportunities, depending on where we were physically located.  She did well in school, and with the help of scholarships, loans and financial aid, attended Boston University. But in her sophomore year, her father died of cancer.   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: We were really working on the classic American dream. And overnight it was all taken away. My mom was back to cleaning homes and driving school buses to keep a roof over our heads.   She moved back to the Bronx after graduating college and spent the next few years working as a community organizer and advocate for children's literacy. In May of 2017, the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her boyfriend became her makeshift campaign headquarters as she launched a seemingly improbable run for Congress. She was working as a waitress and bartender at the time. Like many members of her generation, she says, she had student loans to pay and no health insurance.   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I really understood the frustration that working people had across the political spectrum. When anybody is saying, \"The economy is going great. We are at record levels.\" There's a frustration that says, \"Well, the economy's good for who?\"  Anderson Cooper: I mean unemployment is at record lows.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I don't think that that tells the whole story. When you can't provide for your kids working a full-time job, working two full-time jobs. When you can't have healthcare. That is not \u2014  that is not dignified.  A group of Bernie Sanders supporters who now call themselves Justice Democrats encouraged Ocasio-Cortez to run for office and gave her training and support. She built a grass-roots coalition that took on the Democratic machine by going door to door arguing that she could represent the district better than a ten-term incumbent who spent most of his time in Washington.  Her victory made national news, and she soon had a higher media profile than many veteran lawmakers. Some saw in her primary victory a craving for change within the Democratic Party. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi drew a more limited conclusion:  Nancy Pelosi at press conference: They made a choice in one district, so let's not get yourself carried away   But President Trump rarely missed a chance to suggest that all Democrats were socialists who'd lead the country to ruin.   President Trump at rally in Nevada: Venezuela, Venezuela how does that sound? You like Venezuela?  Anderson Cooper: When people hear the word socialism, they think Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela. Is that what you have in mind?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Of course (LAUGH) not. What we have in mind\u2014 and what of my\u2014 and my policies most closely re\u2014 resemble what we see in the U.K., in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden. Anderson Cooper: How are you going to pay for all of this?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No one asks how we're gonna pay for this Space Force. No one asked how we paid for a $2 trillion tax cut. We only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, healthcare and education. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force. For all of these\u2014 ambitious policies.   Anderson Cooper: There are Democrats, obviously, who are worried about your affect on the party. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, said about left-leaning Democrats, \"If the next two years is just a race to offer increasingly unrealistic proposals, it'll be difficult for us to make a credible case we should be allowed to govern again.\"  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: What makes it unrealistic?  Anderson Cooper: How to pay for it.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: We pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations. And so for me, what's unrealistic is\u2014 is what we're living in right now.   Since the election, some conservative media outlets have focused on Ocasio-Cortez with an intensity unusual for a rookie member of Congress.  She's been accused of being dishonest about the true cost of her proposals and the tax burden they would impose on the middle class. She's also been criticized for making factual mistakes.  Anderson Cooper: One of the criticisms of you is that\u2014  that your math is fuzzy. The Washington Post recently awarded you four Pinocchios\u2014   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Oh my goodness\u2014   Anderson Cooper: \u2014for misstating some statistics about Pentagon spending?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: If people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, I would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees. I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.  Anderson Cooper: But being factually correct is important\u2014   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's absolutely important. And whenever I make a mistake. I say, \"Okay, this was clumsy.\" and then I restate what my point was. But it's\u2014  it's not the same thing as\u2014  as the president lying about immigrants. It's not the same thing, at all.  Anderson Cooper: You don't talk about President Trump very much.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No.  Anderson Cooper: Why?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No. Because I think he's a symptom of a problem.   Anderson Cooper: What do you mean?   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The president certainly didn't invent racism. But he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things.  Anderson Cooper: Do you believe President Trump is a racist?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. Yeah. No question.  Anderson Cooper: How can you say that?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: (CHUCKLE) When you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy. When you look at how he reacted to the Charlottesville incident, where neo-Nazis murdered a woman, versus how he manufactures crises like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it's\u2014 it's night and day.   In response, the deputy White House press secretary said, \"Cong. Ocasio-Cortez's sheer ignorance on the matter can't cover the fact that President Trump supported and passed historic criminal justice reform\u2026\" \u00a0and \"... has repeatedly condemned racism and bigotry in all forms.\"  One of the few things Ocasio-Cortez has in common with the president is an active and often combative presence on social media. When a conservative writer tweeted this photo of her, saying, \"That jacket and coat don't look like a girl who struggles,\" she called him out for what she said was \"misogyny.\"  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Would you be taking a creep shot of Steny Hoyer's behind and sharing it around? Why is there more comfort in doing that to me than there is in doing it to\u2014 any other member of Congress?  Eliminating the influence of corporate money in politics is another one of Ocasio-Cortez's signature issues. Most of her campaign funds came from small donations of $200 or less. She did accept some money from labor unions, but she refuses to take any contributions from corporate political action committees. She's angered some of her colleagues in the House by encouraging primary challenges of Democrats who accept corporate money or oppose progressive policies.  Anderson Cooper: These are politically dangerous tactics that you're using... Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah\u2014   Anderson Cooper: You've heard that?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah.   Anderson Cooper: Do you believe it?  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's absolutely risky. it requires risk to try something new, but also we\u2014 we know so much of\u2014 of what we've tried in the past hasn't worked, either.

            "article_content": "A member of the Republican National Committee, fearing primary challengers to President Trump in the wake of incoming GOP Sen. Mitt Romney's scathing op-ed, is urging fellow committee members to change the rules to thwart intra-party threats to Mr. Trump in 2020.\u00a0 In an email obtained by CBS News, Jevon O.A. Williams, the national committeeman for the Virgin Islands, urged fellow elected RNC members Tuesday night to push for an \"unprecedented\" rule change in the wake of the Romney op-ed's \"calculated political treachery.\" Williams wants to close \"loopholes\" in the nomination in a way that would make it tougher for even token challengers to Mr. Trump to enter the fray. The Washington Examiner first reported the letter. Specifically, Williams urged fellow RNC members to change Rule 40, which requires a candidate for the nomination to garner support from a majority of delegates in at least five states or territories in order to be placed on the nominating ballot at the Republican National Committee Convention. Williams also called for a resolution to declare Mr. Trump the presumptive nominee in 2020, calling for both of those moves to take place at an RNC winter meeting later this month.\u00a0 \"While President Trump would win re-nomination it wouldn't come quick and it wouldn't be inexpensive. Any contested re-nomination campaign\u2014even a forlorn hope\u2014would only help Democrats,\" Williams wrote. \"Accordingly, I am asking for your support to take the unprecedented step of amending the rules to close loopholes in the re-nomination campaign, including Rule 40.\" The email was sent to RNC members two hours after Romney, who has yet to be sworn into office, published an arresting op-ed in the Washington Post titled, \"The president shapes the public character of the nation. Trump's character falls short.\" Romney argued that Mr. Trump has failed to live up to the mantle of his office in the last two years, and America's standing on the international stage is worse off because of it. The op-ed offered a glimpse of how Romney, who has criticized Mr. Trump in the past, might maneuver being a Republican senator under a polarizing president.\u00a0 The op-ed prompted visceral responses from Mr. Trump's staunchest defenders \u2014 including Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the RNC who is Romney's niece and dropped her maiden name -- Romney -- reportedly to appease Mr. Trump. McDaniel, without naming her uncle, blasted the \"incoming Republican freshman senator\" for his criticism of the president.\u00a0 POTUS is attacked and obstructed by the MSM media and Democrats 24/7. For an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive. https://t.co/ArhI7Bi7bo Williams' proposal to thwart challenges to the incumbent president comes as some states also look to fend off challenges to him. CBS News' Caitlin Huey Burns has reported some of Mr. Trump's supporters in early states, including South Carolina and New Hampshire, are looking into allowing the Republican party to simply endorse him without holding primary contests.\u00a0 The Iowa caucuses are scheduled to take place in early February 2020.\u00a0 Here is the full text of the email sent to RNC members, as obtained by CBS News. Williams did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u00a0 Dear fellow RNC member, Merry Christmas (yes, it's still Christmas), happy New Year, and warmgreetings from where many of you probably want to be right now:America's Caribbean. Imagine my surprise when I read the junior senator-elect from Utah'sunprecedented rebuke of President Donald J. Trump in an op-ed on thepages of The Washington Post that ran before he was even sworn intooffice. I couldn't believe this was coming from our party's 2012nominee, who, despite differences in politics, still professes to be aRepublican. With Republicans like him who needs Democrats. Seriously. I swear that Republicans can be their own worst enemy.Democrats don't have to worry about the three-ring circus and civilwar that is engulfing their party's 2020 nomination campaign becauseso-called Republicans are forcing us to spend valuable time, money,and resources in re-nominating our president. Make no mistake. This was calculated political treachery. The op-ed,again before he even assumed office, was published the night of NewYear's Day. This was done to define the week's narrative in themainstream media and chattering class. It also only serves toundermine our party and its president by playing into the hands ofHouse Democrat Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democrat Leader ChuckSchumer as they seek to divide Republicans and distract attention awayfrom their refusal to protect our borders. As an immigrant, a combat veteran, a black American, a millennial, andas a member of the RNC, I wholeheartedly support and endorse PresidentTrump for re-nomination. That isn't to say I don't have mydisappointments. I do. Like many of you, I have been frustrated by theinability to get Republicans nominated to U.S. attorney, U.S. marshal,and District Court judgeships. But the record is clear and PresidentTrump's policies at home and abroad are getting results by putting thenational interest first and foremost. My friends, you know what's going to happen. Messrs. Romney, Flake, and Kasich will continue chasing their fantasyof being president, even if that means destroying our party anddenying President Trump re-election. Look, the political history is clear. No Republican president opposedfor re-nomination has ever won re-election. Unfortunately, loopholes in the rules governing the 2020 re-nominationcampaign are enabling these so-called Republicans to flirt with thepossibility of contested primaries and caucuses. While President Trump would win re-nomination it wouldn't come quickand it wouldn't be inexpensive. Any contested re-nominationcampaign\u2014even a forlorn hope\u2014would only help Democrats. Accordingly, I am asking for your support to take the unprecedentedstep of amending the rules to close loopholes in the re-nominationcampaign, including Rule 40. These rules, as I read them and has beenreported in the press, didn't take into account an incumbent presidentrunning for re-election. Beyond a rules amendment, I also ask for yoursupport of a resolution declaring the RNC's unanimous and unequivocalendorsement of President Trump for re-nomination. This resolutionwould also declare him the presumptive nominee in 2020. I intend forboth of these items to be acted upon at the winter meeting later thismonth, including, if necessary, by suspending the rules to take upthis business. The so-called Republicans seeking to defeat President Trump have usedour silence to advance their cause. It's time to make our voice heard: Our party, be it the RNC or thegrassroots in the 56 states, territories and District of Columbia, isunited behind President Trump. Yours always, Jevon O.A. Williams National Committeeman, Virgin Islands Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "2020 Democratic hopeful U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts on Thursday called on Attorney General William Barr to resign because \"it's the right thing to do.\"\u00a0 In an interview with CBSN's Elaine Quijano, Moulton accused Barr of lying to Congress and cited the Justice Department's refusal to cooperate with a House Judiciary Committee subpoena for the full, unredacted version of the Mueller report and underlying evidence.\u00a0 \"If there is one person who should be following the law of the land, it's the Attorney General,\" said Moulton.  Moulton is one of more than dozen Democratic candidates calling for Barr to resign.\u00a0 Democrats' calls for Barr's resignation have become a tool for President Trump's campaign team, which wrote in an email to supporters Wednesday \"patriotic Americans can't sit by and watch Democrats attack Attorney General Barr for doing his job.\"  Moulton downplayed questions that calls for resignation were playing into the hands of the Mr. Trump's re-election strategy. \"We need to call President Trump out when he is being fundamentally unpatriotic,\" he said. He added that his approach was based on \"principle.\" When he asked why he was the best candidate to challenge the president in the 2020 election, Moulton said he is \"taking him on these fundamental issues of the job, not just as president, but as commander-in-chief,\" with a focus on national security issues. \"We need to make it an issue because it is an issue of President's Trump's performance, and frankly, it should matter to all Americans,\" Moulton said. \"So when people tell me it's not the top issue in the poll, I say that's okay, leadership is about explaining to people why these issues are important.\"  One topic Moulton said he felt is a national security issue is the ongoing crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, something the Trump administration has declared as a humanitarian crisis. Moulton strongly condemned Mr. Trump's response to the border crisis. \"It's on the minds of a lot of American voters, but the president's response to it has been wrong in almost every way.\"  Moulton was critical of the administration's policy of separating families detained at the border, calling it \"absolutely disgusting,\" and saying, \"it couldn't be farther from American values.\"  He said Mr. Trump's proposal to construct a wall at the border would be ineffective in addressing issues of illegal drugs coming into the U.S. from Mexico.  \"We have drugs coming through the southern border,\" Moulton said. \"They're coming through the border ports of entry, that's where we should put more resources and security.\"  When asked about sending troops to the southern border in response to this issue, Moulton -- who served as a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps -- called it a \"political stunt.\"  \"The point is you have to use resources where they're needed,\" Moulton said. \"And this is not a proper use of American troops.\" Moulton said securing the southern border should be handled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, and if needed, government contractors could provide extra security.  Moulton pointed to his military service as a reason he believes he can be successful compared to other Democratic candidates. He said his campaign has started by reaching out to veterans and young voters, and will focus its early message on service, including holding community service events in early states.  \"Fundamentally, this should be a job about public service, and I think a lot of people forget that,\" Moulton said. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u00a0and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom are also seeking the Democratic nomination, also served in the military.\u00a0 Moulton is critical of other Democrats' support for \"Medicare for All,\" saying a \"single-payer system has real problems.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "New Delhi -- Seven people have been killed and 28 injured in two days of small arms fire and shelling between Indian and Pakistani forces. The renewed clashes have taken place along the de-facto border that divides the Kashmir region in half. Both of the nations claim rightful ownership of the entire area, and they've fought three wars over it already.  This week has seen the deadliest border escalation between the nuclear armed neighbors since they carried out airstrikes on each other's territory near the end of February.\u00a0 An intervention by the United States and other nations brought the two countries back from the brink of a possible full-scale war. \u00a0 Four Pakistanis and three Indians have been killed in the cross-border clashes since Monday morning. On Tuesday, three Pakistani soldiers were killed by gunfire from Indian forces. A statement by the Pakistan military said they were killed in the Rawalakot area of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. A Pakistani civilian was also killed in shooting on Monday, and five civilians were injured.\u00a0 On the Indian side, a 5-year-old girl, a woman, and a soldier of the Border Security Force (BSF) were killed on Monday. Eighteen other civilians and five soldiers were also injured.\u00a0 There were no immediate reports of casualties on the Indian side on Tuesday, but the exchange of fire was continuing in at least six areas along the unofficial border dividing Kashmir, known as the Line of Control (LoC).\u00a0 Government officials in one part of Indian Kashmir ordered all schools near the border to remain shut amid the violence. A ceasefire has been in place since 2003 along the border, but both sides' militaries regularly exchange fire and then accuse the other side of \"unprovoked ceasefire violations,\" usually followed by warnings of a \"retaliatory response.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 The cross fire incidents have increased since the February airstrikes, claiming dozens of lives and displacing scores of people from the border areas on both sides.\u00a0 The tension has escalated in recent weeks as India is just days away from a crucial national election in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a second term.\u00a0 National security issues have come to dominate the election campaign in a major shift from previous elections, in which political parties have generally focussed on development and employment issues.\u00a0",

Mr. Trump is demanding billions for his border wall.\u00a0 \"As long as it takes,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I mean look. I'm prepared \u2013 I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right. Again. I could've done nothing. I could've had a lot easier presidency by doing nothing. But I'm here, I want to do it right. But I'm not only talking here. I'm talking about Middle East problems, and other problems and North Korea problems.\" Mr. Trump told his Cabinet he thinks they can work with Democrats on border security, calling the border wall like a sieve and emphasizing the need for a wall. Mr Trump wouldn't say if he is open to taking less than the $5 billion he wants to build the border wall, but dismissed the $2.5 billion floated by his own vice president.\u00a0 \"No, not $2.5, no,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're asking for 5.6. And somebody said 2.5. No, look, this is national security we're talking about. You know just like we talk about the military, just like we're talking about Syria or Afghanistan or all these different places.\" Mr. Trump also claimed he essentially \"fired\" former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. That's after the White House repeatedly insisted Mattis retired. Mattis' resignation letter was intensely critical of the president's military approach, and Mattis said the president deserves a defense secretary who views the world like he does.\u00a0 Mr. Trump questioned what Mattis did for him.\u00a0 \"But what's he done for me?\" Mr. Trump asked. \"How has he done in Afghanistan? How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good. Not too good. I'm not happy with what he has done in Afghanistan, and I shouldn't be happy. But he was very and very thankful when I got him $700 billion. And the following year $716 billion. So I mean I wish him well. I hope he does well. But as you know President Obama fired him and essentially so did I. I want results.\" The president also aired his grievances about troop withdrawals in the Middle East, the border wall, and incoming Sen. Mitt Romney, who wrote an op-ed criticizing the president Tuesday night. Mr. Trump said he was \"surprised\" at Romney's op-ed, but hopes he's a \"team player.\"\u00a0 \"So I was surprised for Mitt Romney but i just hope he's going to be a team player, and if he's a team player, uh, that'll be great,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I will say this, if he fought really hard against President Obama like he does against me, he would have won the election. Does that make sense to you? If he fought the way he fights me, I'm telling you he would have won the election. But I think he's going to end up being a team player, I think he agrees with many of the things that we've done and many of the things that we have in mind and we'll see what happens.\" Later in the day, Mr. Trump will meet with top Republicans and top Democrats in a closed-press Situation Room meeting on border security and the shutdown. Mr. Trump is demanding funding for his border wall, funding Democrats say they won't give him. That meeting is set for 3 p.m. The dynamics in Washington are shifting quickly, with Democrats taking control of the House officially on Thursday.\u00a0 Earlier, the president lashed out at\u00a0Romney on Twitter\u00a0over the scathing op-ed that claimed the president has failed to live up to the mantle of his office and has weakened America on the world stage.\u00a0 \"Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake?  I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!\" the president tweeted Wednesday.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "London\u00a0\u2014 Britain's exit from the European Union seemed to be heading for another delay Wednesday as lawmakers in the lower house of Parliament passed a bill to prevent the U.K. from crashing out of the bloc without a divorce agreement. The bill will now go to the upper chamber, the House of Lords. If all the talk of political rebellions, possible elections, and shutting down parliament has your head spinning, you're not alone.  This is uncharted territory. Below are the basics of what is going on, and what could come next: Prompting a huge outcry, Prime Minister Boris Johnson managed to schedule a shutdown of Parliament from the end of this week. He denies it was his intention, but the effect was to reduce the number of working days lawmakers have before the current October 31 Brexit deadline to try to avert a divorce from the EU without a new trade and customs agreement in place: a so-called \"no-deal\" Brexit. Johnson insists he wants to strike a deal to split with the EU, but has promised to take the U.K. out of the bloc by the October 31 deadline, regardless. He says his best chance of negotiating a new deal with the European Union that a majority of Members of Parliament (MPs) can agree to is to leave the threat of walking away without one on the table.  But many MPs believe leaving the EU without a deal would spell economic disaster for Britain, and they want to do everything they can to ensure it doesn't happen. Late on Tuesday, a majority of them voted to seize control of Wednesday's parliamentary agenda so they could introduce a bill which, if passed in both houses, will force Johnson to ask the EU for a three-month extension to the deadline unless Parliament approves a new withdrawal agreement or votes to allow a \"no-deal\" divorce by October 19.  The bill \"means running up the white flag,\" Johnson said in Parliament on Tuesday. \"There are no circumstances in which I will ever accept anything like it.\" After the \"surrender bill\" passed in the House of Commons late Wednesday, Johnson laid a motion to trigger an election. Elections in the U.K. can be called by a prime minister anytime within a five-year window, but two-thirds of MPs have to approve it for the election to go ahead. Johnson doesn't have anything close to that kind of majority in Parliament. He would need support from the opposition, and most opposition politicians have said they won't back an election until the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is completely off the table. \u00a0 The draft agreement that Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, hashed out with EU negotiators was firmly rejected by the British Parliament on multiple occasions.  The major sticking point was a section known as the Irish \"backstop,\" which is aimed at keeping the land border between Ireland (an EU member) and Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.) open, regardless of what happens in future negotiations between Europe and Great Britain. That border has remained open, virtually invisible but for signs on the road, since the 1999 Good Friday peace agreement ended the bloody, decades-long sectarian conflict known as The Troubles. The \"backstop\" clause states that the entire U.K. would effectively remain within the EU customs union until a more permanent solution to cross-border movement is agreed. Hard-line \"Brexiteers\" refuse to accept the clause. They argue another solution might never be found, and that it would effectively leave the U.K. beholden to EU customs rules indefinitely.  European Union officials have been adamant up until now that they have not been presented with any workable alternatives to the \"backstop.\" There has been a growing sense of confusion and consternation among both the public and politicians in Britain, with protests erupting around the country over the last couple of weeks. \"My country is hurting and in great pain,\" CBS News contributor and veteran British radio host Simon Bates said.   Johnson expelled 21 MPs from the Conservative Party late Tuesday for breaking with his party line, including the grandson of Winston Churchill, Nicholas Soames. \"I'm very, truly sad that it should end this way,\" Soames said in a tearful speech. \"It is my most fervent hope that this house will rediscover the spirit of compromise, humility, and understanding that will enable us finally to push ahead with the vital work in the interest of the whole country.\" \"One day, the pain will pass,\" Bates said. \"We'll wake up in the morning, the sun will be shining and it will all be over. But not yet.\"  Haley Ott is a digital reporter/producer for CBS News based in London.",

            "article_content": "In 2019, CBS News polled thousands of people across the country asking about a wide range of topics including President Trump, the Russia investigation, the 2020 race for the presidency, climate change and even the national anthem. The CBS News Poll also asked the public to weigh in on some anniversaries marking seminal events in America's history.  Here's some of what we found:  2019 began where 2018 left off, with a federal government shutdown. Congress could not agree on a spending bill to fund the federal government so it was partially shut down. The issue at the center of the debate was money Mr. Trump wanted for a border wall. Seven in 10 Americans\u00a0didn't think the issue of a border wall was worth a government shutdown. Much of the partisan divisions we've seen in recent years persisted. Most Democrats didn't think wall funding was worth a shutdown, but Republicans \u2014 most of whom support a border wall \u2014 felt it was. Despite the shutdown, the public was feeling good about the economy \u2014 68% said it was in good shape.  Congress approved a short-term spending bill to reopen the government and, in February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency to appropriate money to build a border wall. Most in the president's own party supported this action, but 66% of the public overall opposed it.  The month began with talk of another possible summit between Mr. Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un (a summit did take place later in the month). Few Americans believed North Korea had reduced its nuclear program, and a majority didn't think another summit should happen. Republicans supported another summit, although most of them also felt North Korea had not changed its nuclear program since the last summit. From the international arena to the football arena, the controversy surrounding the NFL and the national anthem continued, dividing the public. Half said the league should require players to stand for the national anthem, but another half said the NFL should allow players to either stand or kneel during the anthem as they choose. Opinions differed little between football fans and non-fans, but there was a stark divide along racial and political lines: Most Republicans (86%) and whites (58%) said players should be required to stand, while most Democrats (76%) and African Americans (76%) felt they should be permitted to either stand or kneel. In March, Attorney General William Barr released a four-page letter to Congress highlighting the conclusions of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia investigation. Partisan splits that had long marked the investigation remained after the letter was released: Most Republicans said the report had cleared Mr. Trump, while most Democrats were unconvinced and thought Congress should continue to pursue the matter. A majority of the public (77%) supported the release of the full Mueller report. There was agreement across party lines on that.\u00a0 Have you ever fantasized about quitting your job? Most U.S. adults who work full time said they have: 56% have done so at least every once in a while, including 14% who said they fantasize about quitting their job all the time. If they did quit, travel tops the list as the thing people would most like to do with their free time, outranking spending more time with their friends and family.\u00a0 The CBS News Poll measures the public's views on legal marijuana at least once a year. And support for legal pot hit a new high in 2019, with\u00a065% of U.S. adults saying marijuana should be legal.\u00a0 For the first time in CBS News polling, a majority of Republicans (56%) favored legal marijuana. And while those ages 65 and over continued to be the least likely age group to support marijuana legalization, slightly more of them favored it (49%) than opposed it (45%) in this poll. \u00a0 Recent state laws restricting access to abortion had prompted speculation over whether the Supreme Court might revisit Roe v. Wade. Two-thirds of Americans said Roe v. Wade should be left in place, and most who hold that view said they would be disappointed or angry if the ruling were to be overturned.\u00a0 While most Republicans want stricter limits on abortion or to ban it outright, they were split over whether Roe v. Wade specifically ought to be overturned: 48% said it should be, but 45% said it should stay in place.\u00a0 \u00a0 A majority of Americans remained confident about the U.S. economy and most gave Mr. Trump's policies at least partial credit for good economic conditions. Two years after the launch of the Russia investigation, most Americans said they had heard enough about the Mueller report. And more than half said congressional Democrats should drop the Russia matter and move on to other issues. Most Democrats wanted Congress to keep investigating, however.\u00a0  On June 16,\u00a0CBS News released its first Battleground Tracker of the 2020 campaign. It looked at the Democratic race for president across the 18 states holding primaries and caucuses from Iowa through Super Tuesday. CBS News converted Democrats' vote choices into delegates \u2014 the count that will ultimately matter.  The belief that he could fare best against the president propelled Joe Biden to the top spot in both vote share and delegate estimate for the Democratic nomination. This June marked 50 years since the Stonewall uprising, the 1969 demonstrations by members of the gay community in New York City's Greenwich Village in support of gay rights. Most Americans said\u00a0they've seen progress in ending discrimination against gays and lesbians. Sixty-seven percent support legalized same-sex marriage, a record high in CBS News polls. Attitudes may have changed and progress made, but a majority said at least some gay and lesbian discrimination still exists, including 44% who said a lot remains. More \u2014 56% \u2014 said there is a lot of discrimination against people who are transgender. In July, the country celebrated the 50th anniversary of the historic moon landing. Most Americans said the moon landing was worth it and want the U.S. to go back. There is even greater support for sending astronauts to Mars. And some want to take a trip to the moon themselves \u2014 31% of Americans would like to. More are interested now than the 13% that was recorded by Gallup a few years before the first moon landing, when it hadn't yet been accomplished. Things got pretty heated this summer when the president fired off a tweet telling four congresswomen of color to \"go back\" to the countries they came from. Most Americans (59%) disagreed with what the president said in his tweets, but 40% of the country agreed with it, including eight in 10 Republicans. \u00a0 Three in four black Americans described the ideas expressed in the president's tweets as racist, while whites were divided. \u00a0 In August, the CBS News Poll measured the public's views on the president and the economy, trade policy and on their own finances.  More gave Mr. Trump positive ratings on his handling of the economy in general than on his trade policy with China.  There was some public skepticism about whether the president's approach to trade with China will be successful. Only a quarter believed it would be. By year's end, the administration announced the U.S. and China had reached an agreement on \"phase one\" of a trade deal.  Some once protested against the British over a tax on tea, but today, Americans have a preference for coffee. In a head to head matchup between the two hot beverages, 47% said they most often drink coffee, while 40% picked tea. While most men said they drank coffee more often, women have a preference for tea.  Health care is a top concern for most Americans and it will be a key issue in the 2020 race for president. Most favor some type of national health insurance plan, but they like their own health insurance and don't want private insurance to be replaced entirely with a public plan. Keeping costs down is a priority over making sure everyone has health care coverage. And many \u2014 more than four in 10 \u2014 find affording basic medical care a hardship. The CBS News Poll dove into the topic of mental health for a special broadcast of \"CBS This Morning\" called \"Stop the Stigma: A Conversation about Mental Health.\" Two in three Americans said mental illness is a very serious public health problem. It's also an issue that is personal for most: A majority have said they personally know someone who has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder.  Climate change is another pressing issue for the public. In a September poll, 56% of U.S. adults said action needs to be taken right now to address it. Opinions on climate change divide along partisan lines, with most Democrats saying humans contribute a lot to climate change and that people need to act now, and Republicans more skeptical about the degree to which humans are involved and the urgency of the issue. This poll on climate was released as part of Covering Climate Now, a collaboration of more than 250 news outlets around the world providing in-depth coverage of the climate story. Soon after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives would move ahead with a formal impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, the CBS News Poll\u00a0took its first measure on the matter. More than half of Americans approved of opening the inquiry, but there was more division over whether he actually deserved to be impeached over his actions regarding Ukraine. Views remained similarly divided throughout the impeachment process.  October's CBS News Battleground Tracker had some good news in it for Elizabeth Warren. She extended her aggregate lead across the 18 early primary and caucus states. Democratic voters viewed Warren as better able than Biden to handle any attacks from Mr. Trump in 2020.\u00a0 Warren and Bernie Sanders were more likely than Biden to be seen as someone who will \"fight\" a great deal for people like them. Biden still had the advantage on electability, which continues to be a top priority for Democratic voters.  On impeachment, most said the Trump administration should cooperate with the inquiry, although a majority of Republicans disagreed. Partisans became more hardened in their views on impeachment.  Democratic voters' first choice for the nomination across the 18 early primary and caucus states continued to swing back and forth between Biden and Warren (followed by Bernie Sanders), with neither breaking away. But it was Pete Buttigieg who\u00a0made gains in the states of Iowa and New Hampshire. His support in Iowa had tripled since September. And Warren, who was atop the list with Biden the month before, had dropped a bit. Some Democrats expressed concern that Sanders and Warren's policy stances could be too liberal for either of them to beat Mr. Trump in November 2020. Fewer said that about Buttigieg's and Biden's policy positions.  In November, with Election Day a year away, Democratic voters had not grown any more confident that their party's eventual nominee would beat the president. While most said they were at least somewhat confident, just 26% were very confident, a percentage that had barely budged since the summer. With the House set to vote on impeaching Mr. Trump, the public remained divided on whether he deserved impeachment. Hours of public hearings had not swayed public opinion very much.  If or when the matter heads to the Senate, the public is split on what should happen: 42% think the president should be convicted and removed from office, while the same percentage say the Senate should not convict him or not hold a trial at all. December's Battleground Tracker interviewed Democratic voters across the 14 states holding primaries on March 3, known as Super Tuesday. These are the states where one of the latest entrants into the race \u2013 former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2014 \u00a0is focusing his attention and his money. Bloomberg debuted in fifth place across the Super Tuesday states, getting 4% of the vote in the Battleground Tracker. Kamala Harris exited the race for president in early December, and her supporters in the Super Tuesday states moved primarily to Biden and Warren.  As 2019 comes to a close, the campaign has elicited mixed emotions from Democrats in these states: More of them said they feel nervous about it than optimistic.\u00a0 With 2019 soon behind us, many people are thinking about the year ahead. Forty-two percent of U.S. adults plan to make resolutions for 2020, although 56% do not. Continuing with a trend from last year, younger people are more likely than those who are older to say they'll make resolutions. Maybe it's because younger adults will have more time to contemplate resolutions. 70% of those under age 35 say it's very likely they will stay up until midnight on New Year's Eve; a figure that drops to 38% among those 65 years and older.\u00a0 Looking ahead, 2020 will be full of happenings on the political front, including the impeachment trial and the presidential election. Will the partisan divides we have seen in recent years remain? Who will be the Democratic nominee? What will we be talking about at this time next year? The CBS News polling team will continue to measure the views of the American public on the key issues and events that arise. Keep watching.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 House leaders on Monday unveiled a $1.4 trillion government-wide spending package that's carrying an unusually large load of unrelated provisions catching a ride on the last train out of Congress this year. A House vote is slated for Tuesday on the sprawling package, some 2,313 pages long, as lawmakers wrap up reams of unfinished work \u2014 and vote on impeaching President Trump. The legislation would forestall a government shutdown this weekend and give Mr. Trump steady funding for his U.S.-Mexico border fence. The year-end package is anchored by a $1.4 trillion spending measure that caps a difficult, months-long battle over spending priorities. Included in the package is a permanent repeal of some taxes implemented in the Affordable Care Act, including the so-called \"Cadillac\" tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance plans and a tax medical devices. The measure, a product of a divided Congress, also secures health care and pension benefits for roughly 100,000 retired coal miners, and increases the legal age to buy tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and vaping devices, from 18 to 21. The deficit tab for the package grew as well \u2014 almost $400 billion over 10 years to repeal the three so-called \"Obamacare\" taxes alone \u2014 with a companion package to extend several business-friendly tax breaks still under negotiation. The Obama-era taxes have previously been suspended on a piecemeal basis. The legislation is laced with provisions reflecting divided power in Washington. Republicans maintained the status quo on several abortion-related battles and on funding for Mr. Trump's border wall. Democrats controlling the House succeeded in winning a 3.1% raise for federal civilian employees and $25 million for gun violence research after more than two decades of gun lobby opposition. Other add-ons include a seven-year extension of the Export-Import Bank and a renewal of the government's terrorism risk insurance program. The spending package also extends the government's flood insurance program, as well as several visa programs for skilled and seasonal workers. Democrats in the House secured increased funding for early childhood education and a variety of other domestic programs. They also won higher Medicaid funding for the cash-poor government of Puerto Rico, which is struggling to recover from hurricane devastation and a resulting economic downturn. The measure would also provide $425 million for states to upgrade their election systems, and Democrats boosted the U.S. Census budget $1.4 billion above Mr. Trump's request. They won smaller increases for the Environmental Protection Agency, renewable energy programs and affordable housing. \"We are scaling up funding for priorities that will make our country safer and stronger and help hardworking families get ahead,\" said House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey of New York. The outcome in the latest chapter in the longstanding battle over Mr. Trump's border wall awards Mr. Trump with $1.4 billion for new barriers \u2014 equal to last year's appropriation \u2014 while preserving Mr. Trump's ability to use his budget powers to tap other accounts for several times that amount. That's a blow for liberal opponents of the wall but an acceptable trade-off for pragmatic-minded Democrats who wanted to gain $27 billion in increases for domestic programs and avert the threat of simply funding the government on autopilot. Because dozens of Democrats might vote against the border wall, Pelosi is pairing money for the Department of Homeland Security with the almost $700 billion Pentagon budget, which is guaranteed to win GOP votes to offset Democratic defections.",

            "article_content": "Des Moines \u2014 In 2012, the Democrats tapped San Antonio Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro, then 37, as the keynote speaker for the party's national convention. Nearly seven years later, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate told CBS News that being in the spotlight never fazed him.\u00a0 \"I never really felt as much pressure,\" Castro said before pausing to gather his thoughts. \"I think part of being young, when you're a rising star, is that you don't really feel that right away. You don't have much to lose.\"\u00a0 For Castro, the real pressure came when he served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the Obama administration. \"You feel pressure in service to the person you are serving, the president, and to the American people,\" he said. For all the attention lavished on him by the national Democratic Party in the Obama years, critics say Castro's resume is thin. Mayors don't have much power in San Antonio, which is mostly run by an appointed city manager, and HUD is not a typical launching pad for the presidency. The last cabinet secretary to win the presidency, in fact, was Herbert Hoover in 1928.\u00a0 When caucus goers bring up his lack of experience as he barnstorms across Iowa, Castro refers to his tenure at HUD as the most relevant time in his career. In Muscatine earlier this month, Castro responded to one caucus goer's question by talking about his \"federal executive experience.\"\u00a0 \"I actually have stronger experience than many of the other candidates that are running because I have direct executive experience,\" Castro told CBS News. \"That is what you are as the president.\" Going into this week's second Democratic primary debate, Castro says he doesn't want to be \"a flash in the pan candidate,\" and isn't looking for \"a huge spike in support in the summer of 2019.\" He told CBS News he wants to be \"in the right place at the right time\" as the election season speeds towards the Iowa Caucuses. \"You've got to fight your way to be number one,\" Castro said about winning support in a field with 24 other candidates. He told CBS News he felt that people liked his performance in the first debate and said if he has a similar showing Wednesday night, people will \"become more and more confident and convinced that I'm their candidate.\" Earlier this month, Castro said he received over $1.5 million in donations since the first debate. In the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll of Democrats in states with primaries and caucuses through Super Tuesday, 2% of respondents said Castro was their top choice to be the nominee, putting him in 7th place.\u00a0 In the first debate, the big moment for Castro came when he sparred with fellow Texan Beto O'Rourke over whether crossing the border illegally should be a criminal or civil offense. Castro, who believes illegal border crossings should be a civil offense, expects to face more questions about that issue on the stage Wednesday night, but he said it's \"fair for people to point out legitimate policy differences.\" \"I was happy that in the first debate the disagreement that I had with Congressman O'Rourke was a policy difference,\" Castro said. \"What we don't need to get into though is anything personal or a back and forth that is only noise and not really speaking to the differences people have.\" Castro stressed that Democrats want to have a secure border, and highlighted the planes, helicopters, fencing and security cameras currently present along the nearly 2,000 mile stretch from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. But since the issue of removing part of Section 1325 of the Nationality Act, which criminalizes illegal border crossings, came up at the last debate, he's remained adamant that changing the rule wouldn't benefit criminals.\u00a0 \"We have laws against human trafficking, laws against weapons trafficking, laws against drug trafficking,\" Castro said. \"People have asked, 'well if you take away 1325, is that going to encourage more people to come?' And the answer to that is 'no.' For 60-something years, we didn't enforce that section of the law and that's not what either deterred or didn't deter people from coming to the United States.\" On the campaign trail in Iowa, caucus goers have pushed Democratic candidates to be specific about their vision for health care and whether there is a role for private insurance. Castro says he supports a system that offers a public Medicare plan, but keeps private insurance.\u00a0 \"I see it more as a private option,\" Castro said. \"If your plan is solid and you're comfortable with it then you should be able to hold onto it.\" Castro also dismissed concerns that a system which includes both publicly administered healthcare and private insurance could create division if private insurance offers better care that some people cannot afford.\u00a0 \"We're going to have to create a system based on Medicare that is robust enough, strong enough, to provide very good healthcare,\" Castro said.\u00a0 Castro said that if he is elected he wants to accomplish something that Mr. Obama could not: closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center. He acknowledged the difficulty in doing so, saying it would take \"an education campaign\" about what that would look like and says \"work still needs to be done in Congress.\" And regarding America's longest war, Castro said he would like to see the U.S. withdraw from Afghanistan, but maintain a small force with a \"limited role.\" Another round of discussions between Trump Administration and the Taliban is expected this week, but peace talks have yet to include the Afghan government. Castro said the Taliban's role in a post-war Afghanistan needs to be addressed in negotiations.\u00a0 \"I think it's a matter of also ensuring that we stand up for our values like the role of women in their society,\" Castro said, adding, \"my hope is that those talks will include how we can ensure that there is stability there by addressing a number of issues that may not have been addressed as robustly in the past.\" When Castro takes the debate stage in Detroit Wednesday night, it will be his sixth day on the road. The father of two young children, Carina who is 10 and Cristi\u00e1n who is 4, says he tries to cap his time away from home at four or five days at a time.\u00a0 \"Especially with my son, who is 4. He misses me a lot and it is hard to be away from both of them and to be away from Erica,\" he said, referring to his wife.\u00a0 Castro said he tries to Facetime or call his family on the nights when he is away and spend a day or two at home in between trips.\u00a0 \"That's the hardest part of the whole thing,\" Castro said.

Amy Klobuchar, one of the two-dozen Democrats vying for the party's presidential nomination, denounced President Trump's campaign of brinkmanship with Mexico over rising migration from Central America, calling him \"threatener-in-chief.\" On \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, Klobuchar accused Mr. Trump of treating American farmers as if they were \"poker chips\" at \"one of his bankrupt casinos.\" For days, Mr. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods traveling across the southern border unless Mexico's government undertook more efforts to reduce migration from Central America, including tightening its border with Guatemala.\u00a0 On Friday, however, Mexican and U.S. diplomats reached an agreement in principle to stem the flow of families and unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala heading to the U.S.-Mexico border. Last month, the U.S. apprehended more than 133,00 people near the southwestern border \u2014 a 13-year high.\u00a0 Under the agreement, the Mexican government vowed to deploy National Guardsmen to the Guatemala-Mexico border, while the U.S. indicated it would expand the practice of returning non-Mexican migrants who claim asylum at American ports of entry back to Mexico to await their court hearing \u2014 a policy known as \"Remain in Mexico.\" Although Mr. Trump claimed on Twitter that Mexico also agreed to purchase \"large quantities\" of American agricultural goods as part of negotiations between both countries, the Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Martha B\u00e1rcena Coqui refused\u00a0to confirm on \"Face the Nation\" whether her government consented to such a deal.\u00a0 Klobuchar said the manner through the president forced the Mexican government to start negotiations to avoid the levies was \"wrong.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"I think that we should have a consistent strong trade policy that works for everyone in America,\" she said.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney\u00a0slammed President Trump's leadership, writing in an editorial in The Washington Post that \"the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\" Romney will be sworn in as the junior senator from Utah on Thursday. \"To a great degree, a presidency shapes the public character of the nation,\" Romney wrote. \"A president should unite us and inspire us to follow 'our better angels.' A president should demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity, and elevate the national discourse with comity and mutual respect. As a nation, we have been blessed with presidents who have called on the greatness of the American spirit. With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.\" Romney writes in the editorial that he hoped Mr. Trump \"would rise to the occasion\" after the election, and he writes that he approved of some of Mr. Trump's early appointees. But Romney calls the departures of White House chief of staff John Kelly and Defense Secretary James Mattis part of the \"deep descent\" of the presidency in December. Although Romney is critical of Mr. Trump in the editorial, he also writes that he will follow the leadership of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been aligned with Mr. Trump in the past. Romney also doesn't give any specifics on how he will oppose Mr. Trump while in Washington. The president responded to the scathing editorial on Wednesday morning.\u00a0 \"Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake?  I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, a constant critic of the president. Mr. Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, tweeted that Romney \"lacked the ability to save this nation ... Jealousy is a drink best served warm and Romney just proved it.\" The truth is @MittRomney lacked the ability to save this nation. @realDonaldTrump has saved it. Jealously is a drink best served warm and Romney just proved it. So sad, I wish everyone had the courage @realDonaldTrump had. https://t.co/mbxoTqbSX6 Romney sharply criticized Mr. Trump during the 2016 election but then met with him during the transition period before Mr. Trump took office. Romney also accepted Mr. Trump's endorsement in the 2018 election. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Romney reiterated that he was willing to work with the president when he agreed with him and criticize him when they disagree. \"It's important as I begin this new job to make it very clear where I stand,\" Romney said. However, he also expressed support for a border wall, one of Mr. Trump's biggest priorities. Mr. Trump is currently refusing to sign a government funding bill which does not provide sufficient money for the wall. \"I would vote for the border wall. I've made that part of my platform for many years,\" Romney said, adding that he was \"with the Republicans.\" Mr. Trump's approval rating has dropped the most in Utah compared to any other state, according to the Salt Lake Tribune in October. According to the newspaper, 58 percent of Utah residents disapprove of Mr. Trump and only 45 percent still back the president. \u00a0 Although Mr. Trump won Utah by 18 points, Romney won the deep-red state by 48 percentage points in 2012. In the 2016 election, anti-Trump Independent candidate Evan McMullin won more than 20 percent of the vote in the state.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Gaza City, Gaza Strip -- Tens of thousands of Palestinians rallied in the Gaza Strip Saturday to mark the first anniversary of their mass protests along the Israeli border, as the territory's Hamas leaders largely restrained the crowds ahead of a hoped-for cease-fire deal.\u00a0 Demonstrators largely kept their distance from the border, though small crowds of activists approached the perimeter fence and threw stones and explosives toward Israeli troops on the other side. The forces responded with tear gas and opened fire, killing two Palestinians and wounding 64.\u00a0 In many ways, Saturday is a test, CBS News' Seth Doane reported. The Israelis do not want to see violence escalate, particularly about a week before a key national election.\u00a0 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking his fourth consecutive term in April 9 elections, but is facing a serious challenge from a group of ex-army chiefs who have criticized what they say is his failed Gaza policy. In the final stretch of the campaign, Netanyahu needs to keep the Israel-Gaza frontier quiet, without seeming to make concessions to Hamas. Netanyahu took heavy criticism this week for what was seen as a soft response to renewed rocket fire out of Gaza.\u00a0 Hamas, meanwhile, faces growing unrest in Gaza as a result of worsening conditions after more than a decade of Israeli and Egyptian border closures. Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, is behind Saturday's protests, even bringing participants in by bus but also encouraging them to keep calm.\u00a0 Protesters are crying out against what they call the siege of Gaza. Israel has sealed off the narrow Gaza Strip due to security concerns, which affects nearly every aspect of life here, from food to electricity to the ability to freely come and go. About half of Gazans are unemployed. Egyptian negotiators have been in Gaza this week trying to broker a deal that would offer to Palestinians better electricity, expanded fishing zones, fuel for power stations and foreign financial aid. In exchange, Israel is demanding Saturday's protests be non-violent and that Palestinians stop firing rockets into Israel.\u00a0 Tensions increased this week after Palestinians fired a rocket into central Israel, striking a house and wounding seven. Israel pounded back with airstrikes.",

Lee won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay for\u00a0\"BlacKkKlansman,\" which he also directed. In his speech, he challenged Americans to mobilize for the 2020 presidential election. President Trump responded on Twitter, calling Lee's comments \"racist.\" When his name was called, Lee bounded to the stage in his purple suit \u2014 a tribute to Prince \u2014 wearing rings that said \"LOVE\" on one hand and \"HATE\" on the other. He read his speech from notes on a yellow paper. \"The 2020 presidential election is around the corner,\" Lee said at the end. \"Let's all mobilize. Let's all be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let's do the right thing!\"\u00a0 \"Do the right thing,\" of course, is a reference to Lee's Oscar-nominated 1989 film by that name about racial tensions boiling over in a Brooklyn neighborhood. Racial injustice is a recurring theme in Lee's films.\u00a0 Though he didn't mention President Trump by name, the implication was clear, and Mr. Trump did not appreciate it. The president posted on Twitter Monday: \"Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts,etc.) than almost any other Pres!\" Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts,etc.) than almost any other Pres! This was the only moment from the Oscars the president addressed on Twitter, despite several other people mentioning politics during the awards ceremony. While announcing the nominees for best foreign language film, Javier Bardem said in Spanish, \"There are no borders or walls that can restrain ingenuity and talent,\" a veiled reference to President Trump's proposed border wall.\u00a0 Another reference to the border wall came during the opening remarks by Maya Rudolph, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. \"Just a quick update, in case you're confused: There is no host tonight, there won't be a popular movie category, and Mexico is not paying for the wall,\" Rudolph quipped. While President Trump did not directly respond to anything said in other speeches, he did tweet about the border wall Monday morning, reiterating his claim that there is a national emergency at the border. We have a State of Emergency at our Southern Border. Border Patrol, our Military and local Law Enforcement are doing a great job, but without the Wall, which is now under major construction, you cannot have Border Security.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Representatives of National Assembly President Juan Guaid\u00f3, who has been recognized by the U.S. and more than four dozen countries as Venezuela's legitimate leader, believe the humanitarian aid being dispatched to the crisis-stricken South American nation will test the Venezuelan military's loyalty for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\u00a0 As shipping containers block the main highways near the border with neighboring Colombia, two of Guaid\u00f3's top diplomats told CBS News the nation's armed forces will soon face a critical choice: enforce Maduro's orders to stop international humanitarian assistance \u2014  or defect and allow the aid to reach a Venezuelan population grappling with widespread food and medicine shortages.\u00a0 \"This will be a key moment for the military to see which side they will be on,\" Carlos Vecchio, Guaid\u00f3's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News. \"If they will be with the Maduro regime, which is not going anywhere \u2026 or if they will stay with the Venezuelans who need that food and medicine.\" Along with\u00a0recognizing Guaid\u00f3\u00a0as Venezuela's interim president and issuing\u00a0sweeping sanctions\u00a0against the largest state-owned oil company, the Trump administration has pledged more than $20 million in humanitarian assistance to the Venezuelan people. Food, hygiene kits and emergency medical supplies shipped by different countries are being staged in the Colombian border town of C\u00facuta.\u00a0 But Maduro, who has managed to maintain a tight grip on Venezuela's armed forces, adamantly opposes assistance from nations that support Guaid\u00f3, who has called for Maduro's ouster and free elections. He has repeatedly accused the U.S. and its allies in the region of \"manufacturing\" a humanitarian crisis in his country and warned against American military intervention, which he has said would lead to a conflict worse than the Vietnam War.\u00a0 Last week, Maduro even launched an anti-aid campaign on social media and denounced the humanitarian assistance as a \"poison of humiliation.\"\u00a0 In an interview with CBS News partner network BBC News, Maduro called President Trump a white supremacist and accused the \"U.S. empire\" of waging a \"political war\" against Venezuela. He acknowledged that his country has \"problems,\" but the embattled leader said hunger was not one of them, casting the international aid efforts as a ploy to \"humiliate\" the Venezuelan people.\u00a0 \"This is part of that charade,\" Maduro said. \"That's why, with all dignity, we tell them we don't want their crumbs, their toxic food, their left-overs. We tell them 'no, Venezuela has dignity, Venezuela produces and works and our people do not to beg from anyone.'\" Gustavo Tarre, Guaid\u00f3's representative to the Organization of American States (OAS), said Maduro is reluctant to allow the foreign assistance into the country because it would make him and his regime look weak.\u00a0 \"It is an incredible thing that you have a president who has not created the conditions in order for the people to eat and to have the drugs they need when they're ill, but he doesn't accept the foreign aid,\" Tarre told CBS News \"An acceptation of a crisis is an acceptation of a failure of government.\" Tarre added that the critical moment will come if and when supplies start flowing across the border. High-ranking military officials will have to decide whether to follow orders or allow the desperately-needed supplies to enter the country. \"If they are the normal guards, I'm sure they won't open fire, but if they have the people motivated by the government, that's the risk,\" Tarre said. \"But we still think that if you have hundreds of thousands of people behind waiting for food \u2026 they are going to allow the trucks to pass.\" Oil-rich Venezuela was once considered one of Latin America's wealthiest nations. But under Maduro \u2014 who in 2013 replaced the late Hugo Chavez, another leftist firebrand accused of consolidating power \u2014 economic turmoil,\u00a0skyrocketing inflation, food and medicine shortages, mounting crime and government corruption have plunged the country deep into a socio-political crisis.\u00a0 To stifle discontent over the floundering economy, weakened further by international sanctions and plummeting oil production, Maduro has resorted to\u00a0political oppression and reportedly, even torture. Recent elections in the country have been denounced by United States and the international community as unfair and rigged.\u00a0 The dire situation has prompted more than 2.3 million Venezuelans to flee the country since 2014 \u2014 an exodus\u00a0Human Rights Watch\u00a0called \"the largest migration crisis of its kind in recent Latin American history.\" More than one million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia, hundreds of thousands to Peru, Ecuador and other countries in the region and more than 72,000 have come to the U.S. With many poor Venezuelans going hungry, Guaid\u00f3 is hoping the international humanitarian aid he has enthusiastically welcomed erodes pro-government loyalty in working-class neighborhoods, which have historically been bastions of support for Maduro's socialist agenda.\u00a0 The State Department's special representative to Venezuela Elliot Abrams said \"it's probably correct\" that the military \"could prevent international aid from reaching Venezuela.\" \"That would be a really tragic situation,\" he added. \"And we are hopeful that that won't happen.\" \u00a0 CBS News correspondent",

            "article_content": "Indiana Sen. Mike Braun thinks that the government shutdown has \"weeks to go, not months,\" because of the incentives for Republicans and Democrats to compromise. Braun, the Republican who defeated incumbent Democrat Joe Donnelly in the November midterm election, spoke with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast. \"It's going to get a lot more excruciating for each side to persist in a point of view that doesn't cure it,\" Braun said of the ongoing shutdown, which is on track to be the longest shutdown in American history if it continues through Saturday. President Trump is unwilling to sign any funding bills without money for a border wall, and congressional Democrats refuse to provide Mr. Trump's requested $5.7 billion for the wall. \"I'm thinking we've got weeks to go, not months...in that surely we will come together, give minimum border security to the president and to those of us who believe it needs to be done, and we get the government back going and get talking on some of the other issues,\" Braun said. Mr. Trump said in December that he was willing to allow the shutdown to continue for months or even years, or, as Mr. Trump said Wednesday, \"Whatever it takes,\" in reference to the duration. Braun is a supporter of Mr. Trump who often rallied with the president before the 2018 election. Braun said that he was willing to negotiate below the $5.7 billion for the wall at first, but that more funds for border security would be needed later. \"I think that that is such a small figure compared to the $25 billion that everybody was in on and agreeing here a few years ago,\" Braun said. \"I'm hoping we stick as close to the $5.7 (billion) as we can.\" Braun also did not address Mr. Trump's capacity to mislead and dissemble when giving public statements. \"Everybody has a style in terms of how they articulate and issue, and he uses the methodology that works for him,\" Braun said. \"I've never begrudged that because I was so happy that we were shaking the system.\" Braun also talked about the bill he is co-sponsoring with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin to deny members of Congress pay if they do not reach a timely budget agreement. He noted how federal workers were currently not receiving paychecks due to Congress and Mr. Trump's failure to fund portions of the government. \"Anything that comes along with not getting paid you should feel the consequences,\" Braun said.

            "article_content": "Cucuta, Colombia -- U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio visited a border staging point for U.S. aid to Venezuela on Sunday and warned soldiers loyal to socialist President Nicolas Maduro that it will be a \"crime against humanity\" if they block entry of the goods that are being channeled through Maduro's rivals. An enthusiastic throng of Venezuelan migrants, some chanting \"Rubio! Liberty,\" met the Florida Republican as he visited Cucuta and held a news conference in sight of a border bridge that has been flooded in recent months by people fleeing the hardships of Venezuela's hyperinflation and severe shortages of food and medicine. The U.S. has used military and civilian aircraft to fly in food and personal care aid in an effort meant to undermine Maduro and dramatize his government's inability to overcome shortages of food and medicine. The aid is supposed to be moved into Venezuela on Feb. 23 by supporters of congressional leader Juan Guaido, who is recognized by the U.S. and dozens of other countries as Venezuela's legitimate president. Maduro is using troops to block the aid from entering, saying it is not needed and is part of a U.S.-orchestrated attempt to overthrow him. Rubio warned Venezuelan soldiers that blocking aid would be an international \"crime against humanity.\" He said in Spanish that soldiers who keep aid shipments from entering would spend \"the rest of their lives hiding from justice.\" Those who renounce Maduro, however, have been promised amnesty by Guaido and the opposition-dominated congress, although few soldiers have accepted that promise. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that he believed there were obvious signs that Maduro was starting to understand that a majority of Venezuelans reject him as their leader. Pompeo spoke with reporters Friday in Reykjavik, Iceland following an exclusive Associated Press interview with Maduro, who said he was willing to meet President Donald Trump \u2014 any time or place. Pompeo said Maduro's request wasn't new, but it reflected the embattled leader's realization that\u00a0his crisis-riddled nation\u00a0rejects his \"model of governance.\" Maduro revealed to the AP that his government has had secret meetings with the U.S. to resolve the crisis. A State Department official did not deny to CBS News that these discussions had taken place.\u00a0 Rubio, who has been an influential voice in advocating U.S measures against Maduro, noted that about 50 nations have declared Guaido the constitutional president of Venezuela, based on arguments that Maduro's re-election last year was fraudulent, and consider other government-stacked institutions such as the supreme court to have no legal authority. While Russia, China, Turkey and a large number of Asian and African countries still back Maduro, Rubio dismissed them, saying in English: \"The countries that support Maduro do not surprise us. All of them are corrupt and none of them is a democracy and many of them are owed billions of dollars that they want to get paid by the corrupt regime.\" Rubio said the issue is \"a humanitarian crisis, of human beings who have nothing to do with politics.\" He said Venezuelans \"are being denied medicine, food and aid needed to live while those people who are at the head of that regime are living like multimillionaires.\" While Rubio was on the border in Colombia, a delegation of five members of the European Parliament was barred entry into Venezuela after arriving at Caracas' airport Sunday night. One of the visitors, Esteban Gonzalez Pons of Spain, said in a posted on social media that the group was invited by the National Assembly and was going to be the first foreign mission to meet with congress leader Juan Guaido, who the European Parliament and a majority of the European Union members recognize as Venezuela's rightful leader. \"It is not about not letting us in, but about not letting interim president Juan Guaido see any personality from outside Venezuela,\" Gonzalez Pons said. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said Maduro's government had sent word through diplomatic channels several days ago that the European lawmakers would not be allowed into the country to pursue \"conspiratorial\" purposes. \"The constitutional government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will not allow right-wing European extremists to disturb the peace and stability of the country with another one of their nasty interventions,\" Arreaza wrote on social media.",

            "article_content": "Caracas, Venezuela -- Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 said Tuesday that he will try to run caravans of badly needed food and medicine into Venezuela but won't start for nearly two weeks, a timeline that threatens to deflate momentum toward unseating entrenched President Nicolas Maduro. Surrounded by thousands of cheering supporters, Guaid\u00f3 set Feb. 23 as the date for bringing in the badly needed U.S. assistance that has been warehoused on the Colombian border since last week, but he provided few details. The 11-day wait was sure to be a disappointment for Venezuelans desperate for the supplies. More than 2 million people have fled the country's soaring hyperinflation and severe food and medical shortages over the last two years. The minimum wage, which most Venezuelans earn, amounts to less than $6 a month, and it is common to see people scouring garbage for food in the streets of Caracas. \"Right now, I'm going to give this order to the armed forces: Allow in the humanitarian aid. That's an order,\" Guaid\u00f3 told the mass of people gathered in Caracas. Despite the authoritative-sounding assertion, there has been little evidence that the allegiance of the security forces -- the country's key powerbrokers -- has swung behind Guaid\u00f3, a virtually unknown lawmaker until last month, when he took the helm of the National Assembly. Guaid\u00f3 provided few details on how the aid would be brought in from the Colombian border city of Cucuta, except to call for mobilizing caravans of Venezuelans -- a daring and potentially dangerous maneuver that could lead to more violent confrontation with the security forces. At least 40 people have already been killed in clashes since the 35-year-old lawmaker declared himself interim president Jan. 23. Jose Manuel Olivares, Guaid\u00f3's representative in helping lead the aid mission from Colombia, acknowledged the risk, saying he and other lawmakers plan to be at the front of the Feb. 23 push to get the aid in, even if it means risking their lives. \"We have never told people to do something we are not willing to do,\" he said. \"We're going to be there with people taking the risk.\" Representatives of Guaid\u00f3's shadow administration in Washington D.C. told CBS News this week that believe the humanitarian aid massed on the Venezuelan border will be a real test of the military's loyalty to Maduro. \u00a0 \"This will be a key moment for the military to see which side they will be on,\" Carlos Vecchio, Guaid\u00f3's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News. \"If they will be with the Maduro regime, which is not going anywhere \u2026 or if they will stay with the Venezuelans who need that food and medicine.\"\u00a0  Diego Moya-Ocampos, a Venezuela analyst with the London-based consulting firm IHS Global Insight, said Guaid\u00f3 has gained broad support beyond the middle classes and deep into Venezuela's slums, once a stronghold of the ruling socialist party. But that hasn't translated into support from the military and security forces, who Moya-Ocampos said continue to distrust the opposition and fear being held accountable for criminal activity and human rights violations if the regime changes, despite Guaid\u00f3's offer of amnesty. A Venezuelan National Guardsman risked his own safety last week to tell CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer that, along with many of the rank and file in Maduro's military, he was fed up with the Maduro regime and would happily back a change in loyalty to Guaid\u00f3.\u00a0 But the guardsman spoke to CBS News only on the condition that his identity be completely concealed, and said it would take one of the Guards' senior commanders defecting to the opposition, \"to lead\" the rest of the force, to convince him it was a safe move. So far, only one high-level military defection has been made public, so the rank and file -- quietly frustrated or not -- have continued to toe the regime line. \"The military has had more than one opportunity to withdraw support for Maduro,\" Moya-Ocampos said. \"It has consistently continued to back him.\" On the international stage, Guaid\u00f3 has won backing from nearly 60 countries, including the United States, which has pledged an initial $20 million in support and has already shipped emergency food and medicine. Canada says it will send $53 million in aid. Guaid\u00f3 told the crowd that thousands of volunteers he has recruited online would help organize the food and medical supplies and get them across from Colombia. He also announced a second collection point for aid to be brought in from Brazil. Maduro backers, meanwhile, gathered at a square in the capital, cheering and waving flags. They spoke out on state TV against intervention from what they called the \"U.S. empire,\" saying Maduro is Venezuela's rightful president. In an interview aired Tuesday with CBS News partner network BBC News, Maduro called President Trump a white supremacist and accused the \"U.S. empire\" of waging a \"political war\" against Venezuela. He acknowledged that his country has \"problems,\" but the embattled leader said hunger was not one of them, casting the international aid efforts as a ploy to \"humiliate\" the Venezuelan people. \"This is part of that charade,\" Maduro said. \"That's why, with all dignity, we tell them we don't want their crumbs, their toxic food, their left-overs. We tell them 'no, Venezuela has dignity, Venezuela produces and works and our people do not to beg from anyone.'\"\u00a0  Despite having the world's largest oil reserves, Venezuela is gripped by widespread malnutrition, disease and violence after 20 years of socialist rule launched by the late President Hugo Chavez. Critics accuse Maduro, Chavez's hand-picked successor, of unfairly winning an election last year for a second six-year term by banning his popular rivals from running and jailing others.  On Tuesday, protesters called on Maduro to relent, citing epidemic hunger and illnesses that can't be treated in Venezuela. \"Nicolas Maduro should put his hand on his heart and accept that aid,\" said Mayerly Prada, among a group of protesters on the Colombian side of the Tienditas International Bridge. \"It's help for many Venezuelans like my son.\" Prada, a 24-year-old mother of two, said she left her home in Venezuela last week after her 2-year-old son came down with a rash and he wasn't able to get treatment at home. She hoped to get medicine and return to Venezuela.",

            "article_content": "The House of Representatives is passing several government spending bills this week and garnering some Republican support, although these bills are likely to fail in the Senate. President Trump and congressional Democrats are currently at an impasse over the partial government shutdown, with Mr. Trump refusing to sign any legislation which does not provide funding for a border wall. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that he will not put any bills that won't get Mr. Trump's signature on the Senate floor. Nonetheless, the Democratic-majority House is plowing ahead with funding bills without wall funding. On Thursday, the House passed a financial services spending bill which would fund the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service, with eight Republicans joining Democrats to approve the bill. The House passed two more bills to fund the government last week, with the Transportation, HUD and Related Agencies appropriations bills passing with 12 Republican votes, and the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bills passing with 10 Republican votes. All Democrats voted to approve these bills. Eight House Republicans have voted for all three bills: Reps. John Katko and Elise Stefanik of New York, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington, Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan and Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon. Hurd and Katko represent districts which supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Fitzpatrick's district supported Mr. Trump by less than a percentage point in 2016, and Herrera Beutler and Upton's districts supported him by less than 10 points. Kinzinger, Walden and Stefanik's districts supported Mr. Trump overwhelmingly. Reps. Rodney Davis of Illinois and Chris Smith of New Jersey joined those eight in voting for the agriculture bill, and Reps. Peter King of New York and Steve Stivers of Ohio joined the others in voting for the transportation bill. Although Mr. Trump has claimed that Republicans are unified on keeping the government closed without a deal on a border wall, some senators are showing signs of dissent. \u00a0Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, posted a video to Twitter saying there is no need for the shutdown.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham, a Trump ally, said he doesn't know what the path forward here is.\u00a0 \"I have never been more depressed about moving forward than I am right now. I just don't see a pathway forward. Somebody has got to get some energy to fix this,\" Graham said.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Senate has voted to advance a $1.4 trillion government spending package in a last, bipartisan burst of legislating before bolting for the holidays from a Capitol that's toxic with impeachment. The vote in the Senate comes the day after the House voted to impeach President Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The first bill in the two-bill package, covering domestic programs, passed easily Thursday by a 71 to 23 vote, with a vote on a Pentagon and homeland security measure to come later in the day. The second bill passed with even more support, 81 to 11. The legislation gives Mr. Trump a victory on his U.S.-Mexico border fence and gives Democrats long-sought domestic spending increases and a repeal of Obama-era taxes on high-cost health insurance plans. It blends spending increases for both sides \u2014 reelection fodder for lawmakers throughout the Capitol \u2014 with tax and benefit add-ons that will add roughly $400 billion to the deficit over 10 years. The compromise bill would forestall a government shutdown this weekend, and the White House has announced Mr. Trump will sign it before Friday's midnight deadline.\u00a0 The split-their-differences legislation is towing an unusually large haul of unrelated provisions into law, prompting futile protest from fiscal conservatives. It implements a summertime spending deal that reversed unpopular and unworkable automatic spending cuts to defense and domestic programs \u2014 at a $2.2 trillion cost over the coming decade. \"These spending bills are a fiscal dumpster fire,\" said Senator Mike Lee, Republican from Utah. \"This is embarrassing.\" Key provisions include an expensive repeal of Obama-era taxes on high-cost health plans, help for retired coal miners, and an increase from 18 to 21 in the nationwide legal age to buy tobacco products muscled into the measure by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The almost 2,400-page package reflects the reality of divided government and the enduring strength of the Capitol's appropriations process, which allows members to go to bat for their states and congressional districts. McConnell emerged as a victor, winning the politically popular $6 billion pension rescue for about 100,000 retired coal miners, along with more parochial items like help for his state's legal hemp industry and $410 million to build a new veterans hospital in Louisville. The measure securing health care and pension benefits for retired coal miners was a provision championed by Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia. Mr. Trump has often touted his support for coal miners, making this a bipartisan provision. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was also a driving force, winning permanent repeal of a tax on high-cost \"Cadillac\" health insurance benefits that is unpopular with Democratic labor allies. Democrats have cheered several of their priorities in the mammoth legislation, including $25 million for gun violence research \u2014 the first time money has been provided for this kind of research in more than two decades \u2014 and $425 million for election security grants. McConnell, Pelosi and key deputies such as the veteran, pragmatic chairs of the Appropriations Committee have wrestled over the spending package for months, finally cutting a deal on Monday that gives Trump a steady stream of funding for his long-sought border wall. \"I would have preferred no funding for the wall,\" said top Appropriations Committee Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont. \"But the Republicans were clear. ... They stood with the president on the wall, as they seem to do time after time.\" The bill also offers business-friendly provisions on export financing, flood insurance and immigrant workers. A tax on medical devices and health insurance plans would also be repealed permanently. The core of the spending bill is formed by the 12 annual agency appropriations bills passed by Congress each year. It fills in the details of a bipartisan framework from July that delivered about $100 billion in agency spending increases over the coming two years instead of automatic spending cuts that would have sharply slashed the Pentagon and domestic agencies. The sprawling appropriations bill exceeds Mr. Trump's budget requests in virtually every domestic category save for Mr. Trump's request for $8 billion-plus for the U.S.-Mexico wall, which was cut back to $1.4 billion, equal to last year's appropriation \u2014 while preserving Trump's ability to use his budget powers to tap other accounts for several times that amount. That's a blow for liberal opponents of the wall but an acceptable trade-off for pragmatic-minded Democrats who wanted to gain $27 billion in increases for domestic programs. But the Democratic cave-in to Mr. Trump on the wall angered some Hispanic lawmakers \u2014 who lashed out at House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey rather than Pelosi. \"I told (Lowey) we don't appreciate that we're going to get thrown under the bus so she can pass this omnibus and she did exactly that,\" said Congressman Ruben Gallego. The trade-off for the wall money is Mr. Trump's signature on the broader package, which increases spending across the almost one-third of the budget that's passed by Congress each year. Popular bipartisan programs like health research, veterans medical care, NASA, sewer and water projects, and law enforcement grants to states and local governments would get increases, while the $738 billion Pentagon budget is a new record with increases for procurement of expensive weapons systems like the F-35 fighter. The increase in the tobacco purchasing age to 21 also applies to e-cigarettes and vaping devices. Aides familiar with the talks said Pelosi agreed to the tobacco legislation \u2014 supported by big tobacco interests like Altria \u2014 as she also won an arcane carve-out to help unionized carpenters with lower drug costs under their health plans. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But anti-smoking activists were irate at the so-called T-21 provision, saying it doesn't go far enough because it failed to ban flavored vaping products popular with teenagers. It also threatens to kill momentum for more stringent anti-vaping legislation backed by House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone who was one of only seven Democrats to oppose the domestic spending half of the two-bill package. Business groups also praised a seven-year extension of the charter of the Export-Import Bank, which helps finance transactions benefiting U.S. exporters, as well as a renewal of the government's terrorism risk insurance program. The financially troubled government flood insurance program would be extended through September, as would several visa programs for both skilled and seasonal workers. While Republicans touted defense hikes and Democrats reeled off numerous increases for domestic programs, most of the provisions of the spending bill enjoy bipartisan support, including increases for medical research, combating the opioid epidemic, Head Start and child care grants to states. Democrats also secured $425 million for states to upgrade their election systems, and they boosted the U.S. Census budget $1.4 billion above Trump's request. They won smaller increases for the Environmental Protection Agency, renewable energy programs and affordable housing. \"These bills accommodate countless Member priorities on both sides of the aisle,\" said GOP Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, who won many items for his home state of Alabama.",

            "article_content": "London\u00a0\u2014 Friday was meant to be the day Britain formally ceased to be a member of the European Union. But three years after the public referendum calling for the divorce, the two sides appeared no closer to agreeing\u00a0on an amicable separation. Even Britain has yet to figure out what it wants. British lawmakers have made it abundantly clear, however, what they don't want: the hard-won draft \"Brexit\" plan that Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with the EU. On Friday afternoon, Parliament rejected \u2014 for a third time \u2014 May's withdrawal deal, or at least the most elemental part of it: the legal withdrawal agreement. The vote leaves the U.K. closer to a possible \"crash out\" of the European Union on April 12 with no deal in place \u2014 risking a dramatic impact on the British economy. Or Britain could seek a much longer delay to the process from the EU. May's government stripped out all of the \"political agreement\" aspect of her draft deal to bring it to a vote on Friday because she has been forbidden by the legislature from bringing the exact same deal back for a third vote. But it wasn't just that she needed to present an altered plan for a vote; she also knew the devil was in the details.  Nobody really knows for sure. Lawmakers will gather again on Monday to hold another series of votes on a range of alternative plans to May's. But they tried that just days ago and not one of the eight options put forward gained majority backing from lawmakers. As CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips reported from Parliament on Friday, there is no clear path to Brexit. \"I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this house,\" May herself noted immediately after losing the vote. But she vowed to \"continue to press the case for an orderly Brexit.\" Calls were made quickly, however, for May to step down, and the prospect of a new general election was also rising. There are still huge differences of opinion in London over key aspects of how any divorce should work, most notably how to keep goods and people flowing smoothly across the border between Northern Ireland (part of Britain) and Ireland (an independent nation and EU member). The small frontier is the only land border between the U.K. and the EU, and it has essentially been an invisible line for decades, since peace was restored after years of sectarian violence on the island; \"The Troubles.\" On Wednesday, May even offered to resign the premiership if lawmakers backed her deal, but the concession didn't work. She lost by 58 votes. The Prime Minister may now seek another, longer extension to Britain's exit from the EU, but it isn't clear if May will be allowed to remain in power long enough to continue driving the process \u2014 not that a new general election would bring any near-term certainty to the Brexit fiasco. There were also mounting calls after Friday's vote for an outright revocation of the \"Article 50\" measure that the U.K. filed under EU law, officially putting the Brexit process in motion. Some Members of Parliament want Article 50 revoked to give the British legislature more time to find a consensus plan. Others want it revoked to simply stop the process, and possibly not resume it. EU leaders said right after the vote that it had made a \"no-deal\" Brexit even more likely, and they reissued their call for Britain's lawmakers to decide on and then tell the other 27 members states what they want. \"The risk of a no-deal Brexit is very real,\" Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists right after the vote in London. \"One of the two routes to an orderly Brexit seems now to be closed. This leaves only the other route, which is for the British to make clear what they want before April 12.\" Poland's prime minister said before the vote that the European Union was open to further extending Britain's departure from the bloc. Premier Mateusz Morawiecki told reporters, after talks with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, that if May's bid in the House of Commons failed, the EU was \"open to extending the departure process\" on a motion from London, by \"six or nine or 12 months, these options are available.\" But they only want to do that if it looks like such a delay will yield progress at breaking the deadlock in London. In a statement released on Friday, the European Commission said: \"As per the European Council (Article 50) decision on 22 March, the period provided for in Article 50(3) is extended to 12 April. It will be for the UK to indicate the way forward before that date, for consideration by the European Council. A \"no-deal\" scenario on 12 April is now a likely scenario.\" Many Brexit backers in Britain, including in May's own Conservative Party, would be loathe to see the process dragged out much longer, fearing it could lead to death-by-delay of the mandate given by the public in the 2016 referendum. Retired charity worker Mandy Childs, one of a band of hard-core Brexit supporters who walked across England to London under the slogan \"Leave Means Leave,\" said she felt \"heartbroken.\" \"We were told over a 100 times by a British prime minister that we would be leaving on the 29th of March, 2019,\" she said. \"To do that, promise the British people that and then say 'Actually, no, we need to just put it back' \u2014  absolute betrayal. And how dare she?\" Opinion polls have shown that since the referendum, as the complexities of the divorce have become apparent and the \"Vote Leave\" campaign has come under mounting criticism for its tactics during the run-up to the public vote, the tide has likely turned, and a thin majority now appears to be against leaving the EU at all. Indeed hundreds of people did join the \"March to Leave\" rally that trooped through central London on Friday, but the numbers were dwarfed by a huge demonstration in the British capital over the weekend, demanding a second public vote, with many rejecting any Brexit at all.",

            "article_content": "Jerusalem -- The Israeli military lifted protective restrictions on residents in southern Israel on Monday, while Gaza's ruling Hamas militant group reported a cease-fire deal had been reached to end the deadliest fighting between the two sides since a 2014 war. That could mean a wider conflict neither side seems to want has been averted, at least for now.  The escalation had killed 23 on the Gaza side, both militants and civilians, while on the Israeli side four civilians were killed from incoming fire.  The Islamic Jihad militant group, which Israel accused of instigating the latest violence, confirmed that a \"mutual and concurrent\" truce had been brokered by Egypt. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said Egyptian mediators, along with officials from Qatar and the U.N., helped reach the deal. He said Hamas could still use \"different pressuring tools\" to pressure Israel into easing a crippling blockade of Gaza it has enforced along with Egypt. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pointedly noted that \"the campaign is not over, and it requires patience and judgment.\"  The intense fighting over the past two days came to a halt in the early morning hours and residents on both sides went back to their daily routines. The Israeli military said that as of 7 a.m., \"all protective restrictions in the home front will be lifted.\"  Schools and roads had been closed, and residents had been encouraged to remain indoors and near bomb shelters as intense rocket fire pounded the area, threatening to devolve into all-out war.  Israel and Hamas are bitter enemies and have fought three wars and numerous smaller battles since the Islamic militant group seized Gaza in 2007.  In the latest fighting, which erupted over the weekend, Palestinian militants fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, while the Israeli military responded with airstrikes on some 350 militant targets inside Gaza, including weapons storage, attack tunnels and rocket launching and production facilities. It also deployed tanks and infantry forces to the Gaza frontier, and put another brigade on standby. A Hamas commander involved in transferring Iranian funds to the group was killed in an airstrike, in an apparent return to Israel's policy of \"targeting killing\" of militant leaders.  Palestinian medical officials reported 23 deaths, including at least nine militants as well as two pregnant women and two babies. The four Israeli civilians killed were the first Israeli fatalities from rocket attacks since the 50-day war in 2014. One was killed when his vehicle was hit by a Kornet anti-tank missile near the Gaza border.  Egyptian mediators had been working with the U.N. to broker a cease-fire. Under past Egyptian-brokered deals, Israel has agreed to ease its joint blockade of Gaza with Egypt in exchange for a halt to rocket fire.  The latest fighting broke out after Palestinian militants accused Israel of not honoring an earlier cease-fire deal from March, and opened fire on soldiers on the Israeli side of the Gaza border.  The terms of the latest deal were not known, but recent cease-fires have been short-lived.  In weary communities in southern Israel, there was criticism that the latest round of fighting had ended without tangible results - and no hope that it would not recur soon.  \"When we have the upper hand, we need once and for all to finish the terror because this will repeat itself and will not stop,\" said Jacque Mendel, a resident of the coastal city of Ashdod, where a man was killed in his car by a rocket Sunday night.  Despite its fierce response, Israel appears to have little appetite for another prolonged conflict. Later this week, the country marks Memorial Day, one of the most solemn days of the year, followed by the festive Independence Day. Next week, Israel is to host the popular Eurovision song contest and the backdrop of fighting would have likely overshadowed the occasions and deterred foreign tourists.  Netanyahu, who recently secured re-election in part thanks to the votes of the rocket-battered residents along the Gaza Strip frontier, has traditionally been cautious in his handling of Gaza, for fear of sparking an open-ended war with no clear endgame. But he is under pressure from the same electorate to end its anguish and his perspective coalition partners appear to favor a more hard-line agenda on Gaza.  Even within his own ruling Likud Party, Netanyahu faced unusual criticism for not going further to quash Gaza militants.  Likud lawmaker Gideon Saar wrote on Twitter that the reported cease-fire was not an achievement for Israel. \"The timeframes between these violent attacks on Israel and its citizens are getting shorter and the terror groups in Gaza are getting stronger between them,\" he wrote.  Benny Gantz, Israel's emerging opposition leader, also criticized Netanyahu, saying that ending the current round amounted to \"another surrender to the extortion of Hamas and the terror organizations.\"  In Gaza, a year of Hamas-led protests along the Israeli frontier against the blockade that has ravaged the economy has yielded no tangible benefits. In March, Hamas faced several days of street protests over the dire conditions.  Still, Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh said late Sunday that the militant group was \"not interested in a new war,\" and the start on Monday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan likely lessened motivation for battle.  Signs of normal life slowly returned to Gaza, with banks opening after three days; schools are to reopen on Tuesday.  In the northern Gaza Strip, residents searched for a man and his wife missing among the rubble of an apartment building. The upper two floors of the five-story structure in the Sheikh Zayed residential complex was hit by an Israeli airstrike and four Palestinians - a 12-year-old boy, an infant and her parents - were killed.",

            "article_content": "Jerusalem \u2014\u00a0Cross-border fighting between Israel and Gaza's ruling Hamas group appeared to be winding down Friday amid reports of an Egyptian-brokered truce and Israeli media saying a misfire was believed to be responsible for the rare Gaza rocket attack on Tel Aviv that triggered the exchange. The two rockets had struck late Thursday, taking Israel's military by surprise. Overnight, Israeli warplanes hit some 100 Hamas targets in Gaza. The army said targets included an office complex in Gaza City used to plan and command Hamas militant activities, an underground complex that served as Hamas' main rocket-manufacturing site and a center used for Hamas drone development. In Gaza, health officials reported that four people were wounded, including a husband and wife in the southern town of Rafah. There were no further details. The office building struck by Israel had been used by Hamas' office of prisoner affairs. On Friday, Israeli media quoted defense officials as saying a preliminary investigation indicated the rockets were fired by mistake. It was not immediately clear if it was a technical malfunction or human error. The Haaretz daily quoted the officials as saying the rockets were fired during maintenance work. The Israeli military had no immediate comment. Also Friday, a Hamas official said an agreement to restore calm has been reached. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because Hamas has yet to announce the deal, said Egypt led meditation efforts \"that have apparently paid off.\" The sudden outbreak of violence came at a sensitive time for both sides. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the midst of a tight re-election battle. A tough response would draw international criticism and domestic accusations that he is acting out of political motivations ahead of the April 9 vote. But a restrained response will draw criticism from his fellow hard-line rivals. Hamas, meanwhile, is coping with its own domestic troubles. Israel and Egypt have maintained a crippling blockade on Gaza since Hamas took over the territory in 2007. The blockade, along with sanctions by the rival Palestinian Authority and Hamas' own mismanagement have fueled an economic crisis that has driven unemployment over 50 percent. Shortly before the rocket attack, Hamas police on Thursday violently broke up a rare protest by demonstrators angry about the dire living conditions in Gaza. The crackdown triggered heavy criticism on social media. The organizers of a weekly protest along the Israeli border canceled the demonstration in the wake of the escalation. The fighting came as Egyptian mediators were trying to extend a cease-fire between the bitter enemies, which last fought a war in 2014. The Egyptians left Gaza late Thursday. Hamas, which typically claims responsibility for its military actions, denied involvement in the rocket attack on Tel Aviv and even said it had undermined its interests. Israel's military had said earlier Friday that it holds Hamas responsible for all attacks coming from Gaza. The late-night attack Thursday on Tel Aviv, Israel's densely populated commercial and cultural capital, marked the first time the city had been hit since the 2014 war. Following the first Israeli airstrikes, several additional rounds of rocket fire were launched into Israel. The military said several rockets were intercepted by its air defense systems, and there were no reports of injuries. The initial blasts from the Israeli airstrikes in southern Gaza were so powerful that smoke could be seen in Gaza City, 15 miles to the north. The Israeli warplanes could be heard roaring through the skies above Gaza City. Israel and Hamas are bitter enemies and have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized power in Gaza in 2007. Smaller flare-ups have occurred sporadically since Israel and Hamas fought the war in 2014. Despite its denial, Hamas is one of the only groups in Gaza with the means to strike Tel Aviv. A smaller militant group, the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad, also possesses a large arsenal of rockets, though it too denied involvement.",

            "article_content": "Britain's Parliament voted Wednesday against a no-deal Brexit, which would have allowed the nation to leave the European Union without an agreement on how to handle it on the current deadline of March 29. Prime Minister Theresa May said Parliament will vote Thursday on whether to delay Brexit past March 29. May said there was a \"clear majority\" against a no-deal Brexit but the \"legal default\" was that Britain would leave without a deal on March 29 if no deal is reached, BBC News reports. Leaving the EU without a deal would likely be chaotic and cause major disruptions not just in the U.K. but across the remaining 27 EU member countries.\u00a0 On Thursday, Parliament will be asked if they want to delay Brexit until June 30. But that is only if MPs back May's deal by March 20.\u00a0 The lawmakers' 321-278 vote Wednesday has political but not legal force, and does not entirely rule out a chaotic no-deal departure for Britain. But it might ease jitters spreading across the EU after lawmakers resoundingly rejected May's divorce deal on Tuesday.\u00a0 Speaking with a raspy voice after weeks of relentless pressure, May hinted that she plans to make a third attempt to get lawmakers to support her Brexit deal, which they have already rejected twice.\u00a0 She said Parliament faced a \"fundamental choice\" \u2014 a \"short, technical extension\" if lawmakers approve a divorce deal with the EU in the next week, or a much longer delay to Brexit if they don't.  The EU warned that voting against no-deal Brexit wasn't enough to stop it. By law, Britain will leave the EU on March 29, with or without a deal, unless it cancels Brexit or secures a delay.  \"There are only two ways to leave the EU: with or without a deal,\" a European Commission official said. \"The EU is prepared for both. To take no deal off the table, it is not enough to vote against no deal \u2014 you have to agree to a deal.\"  The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the unresolved situation.  Earlier, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier warned that \"the risk of a no-deal has never been higher.\"  As Britain teeters ever closer to the edge of the Brexit cliff, lawmakers are trying to seize control from the divided and squabbling government, although it's far from clear if they can agree on a way forward. There are competing factions that support May's deal, a \"softer\" deal that would keep close ties with the EU, a no-deal Brexit, or even a new referendum on Britain's EU membership. Parliament likely will agree to delay Brexit, but it would need EU approval. The bloc - openly exasperated by Britain's continuing Brexit crisis - warned that the U.K. would need to present a strong reason for any extension.\u00a0 \"I am against every extension \u2014 whether an extension of one day, one week, even 24 hours \u2014 if it's not based on a clear opinion of the House of Commons for something,\" said the European Parliament's chief Brexit official, Guy Verhofstadt. \"Please make up your minds in London, because this uncertainty cannot continue.\"  The bloc is also reluctant to consider a delay that goes beyond elections to the European Parliament in late May, because it would mean Britain would have to participate in the polls even as it prepares to leave.  Both Britain and the EU have ramped up planning for a no-deal Brexit, which would rip up decades of rules for travel and trade between Britain and the bloc. Economists say it could cause huge upheaval, with customs checks causing gridlock at U.K. ports, new tariffs triggering sudden price increases and red tape for everyone from truckers to tourists.  The U.K. government announced its plans for the Irish border in the event of a no-deal Brexit, saying it wouldn't impose new checks, duties or controls on goods coming from EU member Ireland into Northern Ireland. It also said it wouldn't slap tariffs on 87 percent of goods coming into Britain from the EU \u2014 though there would be new levies on imports of some items including meat and cars.  The tariffs, intended to be temporary, wouldn't apply to goods crossing from Ireland to Northern Ireland, raising fears the plan would spark a rise in smuggling.  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said under the proposals, \"Northern Ireland will become a backdoor to the European single market and I think that in a matter of months that will lead to the need for checks at Northern Ireland's ports.\"  \"I don't think the U.K.'s proposals will be workable for very long,\" he said during a visit to Washington.  In Irish border communities and U.K. ports, no-deal anxiety was mounting.  \"Potentially it is going to be a nightmare,\" said Michael Eddy, a district councilor who lives in the aptly named town of Deal, a few miles from the major Channel port of Dover on England's south coast.  He says local authorities have modeled potential disruptions and believe that even \"a two-minute delay for every truck going through the port of Dover\" would lead to a 50-mile (80-kilometer) traffic jam.  \"What then happens with local people wanting to go about their business, wanting to get to hospitals, wanting to get their kids to school, all of that kind of stuff?\" he said.  The European Parliament approved measures Wednesday to ameliorate the immediate hardships of a no-deal Brexit. It backed emergency plans to provide continuity for everything from air, port and road traffic to foreign students to the fishing industry.  The U.K. Parliament has twice rejected the withdrawal agreement that May spent two years negotiating with the EU, and the bloc insists there will be no more talks.  German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned British lawmakers that \"whoever rejects the (Brexit) agreement plays with the welfare of their citizens and the economy in a reckless way.\"  Yet May has not given up on a third attempt to get her deal through Parliament again.  U.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond said he was \"confident that we will do a deal\" in the next few weeks.  Many Britons wish they could share his optimism.  \"I think that a bit of unity would be helpful now,\" said Katharine Beaugie, an artist in Dover. \"It would be much better if we could have found some sort of decision.\"",

Mr. Trump and Pence placed a wreath at the memorial. The president's motorcade spent barely six minutes at the memorial, according to the White House press pool. The temperature was only roughly 17 degrees during Mr. Trump's visit, with a wind chill that made it feel like 1 degree. But Mr. Trump did not directly mention King in his brief greeting to the press.\u00a0 Mr. Trump told reporters it's a \"great\" and \"beautiful\" day, ignoring questions about the ongoing partial government shutdown.\u00a0 The visit was not on Mr. Trump's public White House schedule, and the White House kept the trip quiet until Mr. Trump arrived. In between tweets touting economic growth and blaming Democrats for the shutdown, Mr. Trump remembered the civil rights leader's life in a tweet Monday morning.\u00a0 \"Today we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. for standing up for the self-evident truth Americans hold so dear, that no matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth, we are all created equal by God,\" Mr. Trump tweeted, reiterating remarks he gave last year to remember King.\u00a0 He tweeted about his brief visit later in the day.\u00a0 Today, it was my great honor to visit the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial with @VP Mike Pence, in honor of #MLKDay pic.twitter.com/YsDEA3kygd Mr. Trump has no events on his public schedule for the rest of the day, as he asks Democrats to come to the table to work on ending the shutdown and securing the southern border. On Saturday, the president announced a temporary fix for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients in exchange for wall funding, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called that offer a \"non-starter.\" Democrats want stronger and more permanent protections for immigrants who came to the country as children with their parents. Monday marks the 31st day of the partial shutdown, as hundreds of thousands of federal workers go without paychecks. Mr. Trump did acknowledge their sacrifice in a tweet Monday morning.\u00a0 \"To all of the great people who are working so hard for your Country and not getting paid I say, THANK YOU - YOU ARE GREAT PATRIOTS!\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"We must now work together, after decades of abuse, to finally fix the Humanitarian, Criminal & Drug Crisis at our Border. WE WILL WIN BIG!\" Meanwhile, Democrats with an eye on the 2020 presidential election are participating in MLK Day events up and down the East Coast. Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, Kristen Gillibrand, among others, are remembering King at high-profile events with African-American leaders.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic fundraising nonprofit ActBlue announced small donors gave $420 million using their technology in the first half of the year. With the election still more than a year away, 3.3 million people donated to nearly 9,000 Democratic campaigns and progressive organizations, the organization said. The average donation was $32.\u00a0 In the second quarter of the year alone, donors gave $246 million.\u00a0 \"Small-dollar  donors are already showing that they will be a force in races up and down the ballot this cycle. These numbers show that there is incredible energy among the grassroots already, and we're still more than a year out from Election Day,\" said ActBlue Executive  Director Erin Hill in a statement.\u00a0 \"We're  seeing millions of donors, record-breaking totals every quarter, and a rapidly-growing small-dollar army that is ready to help Democrats take back everything from school boards to the White House next year.\"\u00a0 ActBlue  said it raised $170 million more in the first half of 2019 than it did by the same stage in the 2018 midterm election cycle. As of July 2017, it had only raised $249 million from grassroots donors. The  3.3 million donors giving in the first half of this year is also on track to break records. ActBlue said 4.9 million donors gave using their technology over the entire course of the 2018 election cycle.\u00a0 ActBlue's  cash haul was aided by a surge in donations towards the end of the fundraising period. Over one million donors gave in the last ten days of the second quarter. The largest number of contributions came on June 30th, with 390,000 donations.\u00a0 Despite it being a presidential year, ActBlue users gave twice as much money in the first half of the year to win and protect state legislative seats as they did at this point in the 2018 cycle. Of donors who have given to both a presidential candidate  and another candidate or group, more than half gave their first contribution of the year to the non-presidential candidate or organization before going on to donate in the presidential race. ActBlue also saw three times as much money given to local candidates  and groups as it did in the last election cycle. Apart  from giving to Democratic candidates, people are also donating to help causes and push back against Trump administration policies. According to ActBlue, small-dollar donors raised $1.3 million in the second quarter for groups helping parents and children separated at the border. And many donors are making a habit of contributing to Democratic causes, with 40% of them giving repeatedly in the first half of the year. More than $77 million of the total money raised came from reoccurring contributions.\u00a0 In  June, President Trump and the Republican National Committee celebrated the launch of WinRed, which is seen as the GOP equivalent of ActBlue. This week, Mr. Trump, his committees and the RNC revealed that they raised $123 million in the second quarter of 2019. CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

            "article_content": "Representative Mac Thornberry announced Monday that this would be his last term in office, making him the sixth House Republican from the Texas delegation to forego re-election in 2020. In a statement, Thornberry said he believed \"it was a time for a change.\" The congressman has been representing the state's 13th district near the panhandle since 1995, and was re-elected with more than 80 percent of the vote in 2018.\u00a0 \"With over a year to go, I will continue to represent the people of the 13th District to the best of my ability. Our nation faces many difficult challenges, and none of us can relax our efforts to meet and overcome them, whether at home or around the world,\" Thornberry said in a released statement.\u00a0 His announcement brings the count of GOP House members not returning for another term to 19. A total of 13 have had \"pure retirements,\" including Thornberry, while three have resigned and four have announced they'd be seeking other office in 2020. Chris Collins, an embattled congressman from Upstate New York, became the third Republican to resign from the House on Monday.\u00a0 By comparison, there are four House Democrats nationwide who have announced they will retire or seek another office in 2020, not counting the two Democratic members of the House who are running for president.\u00a0 Retiring lawmakers have given different reasons for not seeking re-election, ranging from family commitments to chairmanship limits. Thornberry himself has reached his limit on the House Armed Services Committee, where he served two terms as chairman before Democrats won the House last year. He was the first Texan to hold the position. Thornberry is third GOP House member from the Armed Services committee to announce retirement, joining Mike Conaway of Texas and Rob Bishop of Utah. As the top Republican member of the committee, Thornberry has been a fierce advocate for increased military spending and helped secure a larger defense budget under President Trump. He has also criticized how the Trump administration and Democrats in the House are handling national security issues.\u00a0 Thornberry voted not to terminate Mr. Trump's emergency declaration at the border, but said he did not support repurposing military money to build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico in an interview with CBS News Chief Washington Correspondent Major Garrett for \"The Takeout\" podcast.\u00a0 \"I am not for taking away money from that effort to fund anything else,\" Thornberry said.\u00a0 When Mr. Trump declared victory in the fight against ISIS, Thornberry and Adam Smith, the Democratic chairman of the Armed Services committee, released a statement criticizing plans to remove U.S. forces from Syria.\u00a0 \"We are concerned that it would be a strategic error to remove U.S. forces precipitously from Syria without regard to the impact it might have on our ability to consolidate our military gains against ISIS, ensure the safety of our partners, including the Kurds and other Syrian Democratic Forces, and uphold regional stability against malign actors such as Russia and Iran,\" they wrote.\u00a0 Democrats have sounded optimistic about flipping Texas in 2020 despite the state's Republican lean. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been touting the \"Texodus,\" or the string of GOP House members from Texas retiring, as a sign that the state is becoming more competitive. Of the six retirees from Texas, Representatives Will Hurd, Kenny Marchant and Pete Olson each won by less than 5 percent in 2018. Hurd, who won re-election by just over 925 votes, said at the Texas Tribune Festival over the weekend, \"Texas is a jump-ball. Texas is purple.\" Texas Democratic Party Executive Director Manny Garcia said in a statement, \"A quarter of the Texas House Republican Delegation has now retired\u2014 a staggering amount for the largest Republican delegation in Texas.\" \"Texas is the biggest battleground state. Republicans know it and Texas Democrats damn sure know it.\" However, Thornberry's district has been historically Republican in presidential election years. President Barack Obama won just over 18 percent of the district in 2012, and Hillary Clinton won just 17 percent in 2016. Texas itself hasn't been won by a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976.\u00a0 One of the longest-serving representatives from Texas, Thornberry previously served in the State Department during President Ronald Reagan's administration. He began his Congressional career by defeating Democrat incumbent Bill Sarpalius by 11 points in 1994.\u00a0 \"When I first announced that I was running for Congress on Veterans' Day 1993, I quoted the great minister, Dr. Peter Marshall, who said, 'A different world cannot be built by indifferent people,'\" he said in a statement. \"In January 2021, I will no longer have the honor of representing the people of the 13th District of Texas, but I will never be indifferent to the responsibility each of us has to serve and protect our beloved nation.\" Correction: An earlier version of this story said Congressman Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, has not yet indicated whether he will run for re-election if his presidential campaign is unsuccessful. He is running for his House seat and the presidency simultaneously.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

The rally comes two weeks ahead of Louisiana's governor's election, and one night after both Republicans and Democrats notched major wins in state races.\u00a0 Mr. Trump, who won the state of Louisiana in 2016 with 58% of the vote, opened the rally by calling Edwards a \"radical liberal Democrat\" who \"has not done the job.\" He warned voters that \"with John Bel Edwards, you will soon have a sanctuary city in your midst,\" and claimed that Edwards is backed by pro-abortion lobbyists \u2014 even though it is well-documented that Edwards is anti-abortion rights.\u00a0 Mr. Trump also paid special attention to auto insurance rates, which he said were higher in Louisiana than in any other state. \u00a0 \"Your car insurance is the highest in the world, your taxes are horrible,\" he said. \u00a0 In contrast, Mr. Trump described Republican candidate Eddie Rispone as someone who \"will cut your taxes and regulations, cut your car insurance in half\u2026 and turn this state into a giant magnet for great-paying jobs.\"\u00a0 Rispone is \"rough on crime, strong on borders, and he'll work with ICE and border patrol to get violent criminals off the streets,\" Mr. Trump said, and \"will defend your values from an all out assault from the extreme left.\" Rispone, a millionaire construction magnate and prominent GOP donor making his first bid for public office, often paints himself as a Trump-like outsider who wouldn't be a \"politically correct\" governor. He contrasts his image with Edwards by frequently associating him with the establishment and pointing out that he was a superdelegate for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Edwards, however, is socially conservative on some key issues, including abortion. He was part of a wave of governors this year who signed a bill to ban abortions after six weeks. Louisiana \u2014 which could become the first state without legal abortion access, depending on the outcome of a Supreme Court case \u2014 has the highest percentage of people who believe all forms of abortion should be illegal. Edwards initially held a slight advantage in the race \u2014 but the outcome has become a toss-up since Edwards fell shy of the 50% he needed to avoid the November runoff. Mr. Trump brought a number of guests on stage, including Rispone and both of Louisiana's GOP senators, John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy.\u00a0 \"Unless you're happy with crappy, I want you to vote Eddie Rispone for governor,\" Kennedy said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump also welcomed Phil Robertson and Willie Robertson from the show \"Duck Dynasty,\" a show the president said he recently watched and found \"a lot of wisdom there.\" A&E put Phil Robertson on \"hiatus\" in 2013 after he made racist and homophobic comments to GQ and the show was canceled outright in 2016.\u00a0 He also attacked his regular rally targets, including the \"horrible, disgusting\" Washington Post, the \"unhinged extremist\" Democrats, and the \"deranged, delusional, destructive and hyper-partisan\" impeachment inquiry.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's visit comes on the heels of Election Day in Kentucky and Mississippi \u2014 the only other states with a governor's race this year. Louisiana's election isn't until Saturday, November 16, but early voting already started, and Mr. Trump urged his supporters to cast their ballots now. He will return to the state next Thursday to campaign again for Rispone.\u00a0 Mr. Trump did not mention incumbent Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin's apparent loss to Democrat Andy Beshear on Tuesday, despite the last-minute appearances from the president and vice president to get out the vote. Although Beshear has declared victory, Bevin refused to concede, and on Wednesday requested a formal recanvassing.\u00a0 Democrats also took control of both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly \u2014 and with Governor Ralph Northam, Democrats now have full control over Virginia government for the first time since the early 1990s. But Republicans did win the governor's race in Mississippi, as well as a number of down-ballot elections in both Mississippi and Kentucky.\u00a0 \"A great evening last night in Kentucky and Mississippi for the Republican Party with 13 BIG WINS, including a Governorship in Mississippi,\" Trump tweeted Wednesday. \"Congratulations to everyone!\"\u00a0 Eleanor Watson and Sara Cook contributed reporting.\u00a0 Victoria Albert is a Sr. News Editor at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 believes Democratic candidates vying to challenge President Trump in the 2020 presidential election need to make issues affecting the island and its approximately 3.2 million U.S. citizens central to their campaigns. \"It's not just a matter of having lip service and saying, 'Yes, we want equality for the people of Puerto Rico,' but what are you actually going to do about it?\" Rosell\u00f3 told CBS News during a wide-ranging interview in Washington on Friday. The 39-year-old governor of the U.S. territory, who has supported both Democrats and Republicans in congressional elections on the mainland, said he will back the eventual Democratic presidential nominee. He said contenders in the crowded primary field, the most diverse in U.S. history, should have a broad agenda that addresses Puerto Rico's most pressing challenges, including ongoing recovery efforts from the devastation of Hurricane Mar\u00eda\u00a0and\u00a0a prolonged debt crisis. Rossell\u00f3 noted that two Democrats seeking the nomination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, visited the island shortly after launching their campaigns. The governor said stumping in Puerto Rico should become routine practice for all presidential hopefuls, and he expects all the Democrats who have declared their candidacies to visit the island soon.\u00a0 \"I think it showcases that Puerto Rico has risen from a seven-page issue to a top-level issue in general discussion of policy and politics in the United States,\" he said.\u00a0 Although he said he still needs to evaluate the platforms of different campaigns on climate change, health care, recovery efforts and Puerto Rican self-determination before endorsing any candidate, Rossell\u00f3 stressed the policy differences between the Democratic contenders and the president are \"stark.\" In a thinly veiled rebuke of Mr. Trump and his policies, the governor said voters will be able to choose between two completely distinct options next November.\u00a0 \"It's an election to see if we want to open ourselves to the world and invite diversity, or we want to close, shut ourselves out and have a more exclusive and divisive separated world view from the rest of the nation,\" he said. In the aftermath of Hurricane Mar\u00eda, which crippled the island's fragile electrical grid and led to the deaths of thousands of people, Rossell\u00f3 said he had several conversations with the president, whose post-storm visit to Puerto Rico gained notoriety for a controversial incident in which he tossed rolls of paper towels to hurricane survivors. But the governor said he no longer has a working relationship with Mr. Trump. In fact, he said he recently has requested several one-on-one meetings to discuss recovery efforts with the president, to no avail.\u00a0 \"We've sort of have lost that connection,\" Rossell\u00f3 added.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has repeatedly clashed with Rossell\u00f3 and other Puerto Rican officials over federal assistance to the U.S. territory. His administration's handling of recovery efforts in the aftermath of Mar\u00eda and Irma have been sharply criticized by some local residents and leaders. Recently, Rossell\u00f3 has denounced the White House for considering diverting disaster relief funds to finance the president's long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and opposing $600 million in food assistance funding, which the White House called \"excessive and unnecessary.\"\u00a0 \"It is concerning to hear that at one point, on the table, was a consideration of taking recovery funds from Puerto Rico to use them to build a wall,\" Rossell\u00f3 said. \"That is very worrisome. That is very concerning. And I hope that that sort of mindset shifts away, because otherwise, what we're seeing towards the future is continuous conflict.\" Rossell\u00f3, a former stem-cell researcher, added that another important policy disagreement with the White House is over climate change, which he said disproportionately affects Puerto Rico because of its location in the middle of the Caribbean.\u00a0 \"[Climate change] is big for me, because we're on an island,\" he said. \"Puerto Rico is [the] third jurisdiction that was most affected by climate change in the world. And now, we stand on a position to become the model for resiliency in the future.\" He condemned the president for not believing in human-induced climate change and its broad implications on the environment, stressing the urgent need to undertake concerted steps to mitigate it. Mr. Trump has called climate change a \"hoax,\" but scientists \u2014 including those working for his administration \u2014 have\u00a0repeatedly rebuffed him\u00a0for downplaying the assessment by the scientific community that the planet's\u00a0changing climate\u00a0is causing irreparable environmental damage. \"As a scientist, I can tell you: it's very real. And as a Puerto Rican that lives in the island and sees the coastline diminishing, that sees how an island, Palominito, which was there three years ago is no longer there,\" he said. \"These things are having a real effect.\" Although Rossell\u00f3 said he agrees with the grievances many of his constituents have against the Trump administration, he noted that Puerto Rico has been treated in an \"inferior fashion\" by Washington for decades \u2014 long before Mr. Trump was sworn in. For Rossell\u00f3, the only way to end what he believes is the federal government's unfair treatment of Puerto Rico is for the island to become the nation's 51st state.\u00a0 In the past seven years, the Puerto Rican government has held two referendums on the status of the island. In both cases, voters chose statehood, but because any change in status requires congressional approval, the results were symbolic.\u00a0 For Rossell\u00f3, a vocal supporter of Puerto Rican statehood, admission into the union as a state would place the island on a \"pathway of growth\" that would allow it to curtail inequality, recover faster from the storms and alleviate financial woes. Because the island is a \"colonial territory,\" Rossell\u00f3 suggested there's a salient disparity between the federal government's policies towards Puerto Rico and the ones for states in the mainland. He cited the fact that the nutritional program in Puerto Rico, known as NAP, can't expand to meet increased demand like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) available in states because it is funded through an annual federal block grant. Rossell\u00f3 believes news coverage of Puerto Ricans' plight post-Mar\u00eda can generate political momentum to solve the island's perpetual struggle over questions of self-determination, which dates back to the late 19th century when the U.S. acquired the territory after the Spanish-American War.\u00a0 \"We want, with the visibility that Puerto Rico now has, with the truth of the matter that folks are now starting to be aware of the fact that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, we're part of the United States, and we need to end colonialism once and for all,\" he said. Democrats running for president in 2020, Rossell\u00f3 added, should make a commitment to support a legally binding referendum that triggers a change in the island's political status if Puerto Ricans vote in favor of doing so once again. \"It has to be binding. You can't just say, 'I'm for self-determination,' and then have the people self-determine and do nothing about it,\" he said.\u00a0 Changing its status from a commonwealth to a state, Rossell\u00f3 said, will allow Puerto Ricans on the island to have a voice in Washington. Puerto Rico currently only has a non-voting member serving in the House of Representatives.\u00a0 \u00a0 Statehood would grant Puerto Rico congressional representation in both the Senate and House as well as a stronger influence in presidential elections. Because they don't have voting representation in Congress, voters living in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are not entitled to electoral votes. Despite having non-voting representation in Congress, voters in the District of Columbia have been able to cast ballots in presidential elections since the 23rd Amendment was ratified in 1961.\u00a0 Rossell\u00f3 said it is \"bizarre\" that more than 3 million American citizens can't vote for president because of where they live.\u00a0 \"Any of these citizens, should they move to the states, would be able to vote anyway,\" he added. \"Any U.S. citizen that would move to Puerto Rico would lose those rights.\" Puerto Rican communities in the mainland, however, can help change this, he added.\u00a0 Although Puerto Ricans living on the island can only only vote in party primaries and not the general election, Rossell\u00f3 said the large and growing Puerto Rican diaspora in the mainland is becoming an important voting bloc and can have some sway in national elections, particularly in battleground states like Florida \"If we get organized and have a clear platform, we will be a force to be reckoned with in national politics,\" he said. Rossell\u00f3 did not rule out out running for Congress if Puerto Rico becomes a state, but said his priority right now is to help the island achieve statehood.\u00a0 \"My focus right now is governing Puerto Rico and turning Puerto Rico into a state,\" he said. \"My dream would be that somebody in Puerto Rico would get to be a senator, and would get to be a congressman or congresswoman representing our island.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "\u00a0Republicans are deciding Tuesday who should carry their party's banner in a high-profile special election for a North Carolina congressional seat vacant since last year's election was deemed tainted by fraud. Republican and unaffiliated voters in the 9th Congressional District cast ballots in person after two weeks of early voting to decide which GOP candidate will face Democrat Dan McCready. The general election will be Sept. 10 if one candidate collects more than 30 percent of the votes in Tuesday's primary. If no one tops that milestone, that September date will be used for a runoff between the top two Republicans and the general election will be Nov. 5. The special election was required after the state elections board found last year's contest tainted when Republican Mark Harris used a political operative who improperly handled mail-in ballots. Harris, who narrowly led after November's votes were counted, opted not to run again. McCready is running unopposed. The top candidates in the GOP primary include Harris' endorsed candidate, a former Democrat who helped defeat an incumbent Republican for state Supreme Court last year, and a state legislator who sponsored legislation in 2016 voiding anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people. Catawba College professor Michael Bitzer is projecting voter turnout of 10% to 15%. He analyzed early voters and found their average age was 64, almost 20 years higher than the district's average for registered unaffiliated and Republican voters. State Sen. Dan Bishop, who in 2016 sponsored the so-called \"bathroom bill,\" raised the most in campaign contributions, seeded with $250,000 from the Charlotte attorney's own bank account. Real estate agent Leigh Brown was backed by more than $1 million from a national political action committee representing Realtors. Chris Anglin, the former Democrat, was barred from GOP debates and failed in a lawsuit to force the state Republican Party to share internal data with him. Union County Commissioner Stony Rushing, who said he was named for a Flintstones cartoon character, produced an ad in which he donned rubber boots and wrapped a snake around his neck to underline his promise to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington. Bucking the Republican Party was a big theme throughout the GOP primary, with candidates calling party leaders in Washington and Raleigh spineless or corrupt. Matthrew Ridenhour, a former county commissioner and Marine who lives in Charlotte, said he refused to pay heed when party authorities urged him to stay out of the race. \"It's our time. It's time for all the people who are sick of the same old, same old establishment smoke and mirrors game. And we as the American people feel like we're getting played. That's who I am,\" he said during a GOP debate last week. The GOP's brand has suffered in the wake of the much-publicized investigation into Harris' campaign, followed last month by federal charges accusing the state party's chairman of working with a big-money donor to try bribing North Carolina's top insurance regulator. \"Folks actually do bring this up,\" Ridenhour said. \"What's going on with the GOP? What happened to your GOP chairman? What's going on there with these donors? Are you involved in that? Did you take any money from that donor? I did not. But that's a question that comes up often.\" Candidates have differentiated themselves by focusing on their personal narratives but have been largely unanimous in their support for President Donald Trump and gun rights, and opposition to abortion and left-wing Democrats they contend are vanguards of socialism. Half the candidates live outside the 9th district, which is allowed, but which Ridenhour and others dismissed as opportunism. The congressional district stretches from suburban Charlotte to suburban Fayetteville along the South Carolina border. It has been in GOP hands since 1963 and President Donald Trump won it by 12 percentage points in 2016.",

            "article_content": "President Trump tore into Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards at a rally Thursday night, two days ahead of the state's governor's election. The president also wasted little time in unleashing attacks against the Democrats and the impeachment inquiry hearings. \"The eyes of history are looking upon the great people of Louisiana,\" Mr. Trump told thousands of supporters in Bossier City, adding, \"I really need you, but you really need you, to send a message to the corrupt Democrats in Washington.\" Edwards, the South's only Democratic governor, will face off against Eddie Rispone, a construction magnate and GOP donor making his first run for public office. Rispone, who Mr. Trump described Thursday as a \"true Louisiana champion,\" has called himself an outsider who won't be \"politically correct.\" Mr. Trump, who won the state of Louisiana in 2016 with 58% of the vote, told voters that Edwards is a \"tool of Nancy, a tool of Chuck,\" and said he wants open borders, high taxes and \"radical pro-abortion policies.\" In fact, Edwards is socially conservative when it comes to abortion, and was one of many governors who signed a bill that would ban abortions after six weeks. Mr. Trump invited a number of prominent Louisiana politicians to join him onstage, including Senators Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy. Senator Kennedy railed against the \"cultured, cosmopolitan, goat's milk latte-drinkin', avocado toast-eating, insiders elite,\" and repeated call to action from Mr. Trump's last Louisiana rally: \"Unless you're happy with crappy, vote Eddie Rispone for governor.\" Senator Cassidy warned voters that \"this is going to be a close election,\" and urged them to \"get your neighbor, and your neighbor's neighbor\" to vote. \"By supporting Eddie, you will deliver a powerful rebuke to the socialists trying to sabotage our democracy and to erase your cherished way of life in Louisiana,\" Mr. Trump added. This is Mr. Trump's first rally after House Democrats began public hearings in the impeachment inquiry. On Wednesday, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, testified that one of his aides overheard Mr. Trump on a phone call with U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, asking about \"the investigations.\" That aide was confirmed by CBS News to be David Holmes, who will be testifying behind closed doors before Congress on Friday. Republicans, including the president, attempted to dismiss the testimony by Taylor and another career diplomat, State Department official George Kent. The president decried the proceedings as a \"witch hunt.\" At Thursday's rally, the president slammed the inquiry by saying, \"We did nothing wrong, and they're doing nothing\" and attempted to label Taylor and Kent as \"never Trumpers.\" \"How about when they asked the two never Trumpers, 'uh, what exactly do you think you impeach him for?' And they stood there and went like, 'what?'\" Mr. Trump said, drawing laughs from the audience. \"Their schemes are already unraveling,\" Mr. Trump said. \" Their sinister plans will fail. They have already failed as far as I am concerned.\" Mr. Trump added that the inquiry has been \"very hard on my family\" \u2014 but claimed congressional Republicans were asking him to keep it going because it was helping them in the polls. \"Based on the poll numbers, the people in this country aren't buying it, because we're going up and they're going down,\" Mr. Trump said. \u2014 Fin Gomez and Eleanor Watson contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has struck a defiant tone amid mounting international pressure on him to stand down. He has accused the United States of planning a coup in the South American country, and warned President Trump in an interview broadcast on Spanish television that he is, \"making mistakes that are going to stain your hands with blood!\" Maduro said he \"accepts ultimatums from nobody,\" as more individual European nations followed through with a threat to back opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 after Maduro neglected to call a new national election by a Sunday deadline. The Trump administration has also enthusiastically backed Guaid\u00f3, who declared himself the interim president of Venezuela on Jan. 23. \"The military option is on (U.S. President) Donald Trump's table,\" Maduro told Spanish TV channel La Sexta (The Sixth) in the interview aired Sunday evening. He accused the U.S. of \"wanting to return to the 20th century of military coups, subordinate puppet governments and the looting of resources.\" Asked if his country could descend into civil war, Maduro said, \"only if the North American empire attacks us -- we will have to defend ourselves.\" \"Stop! Stop! Donald Trump! You are making mistakes that are going to stain your hands with blood! And you are going to leave the presidency stained with blood. Stop!,\" the embattled president told his interviewer, adding that Venezuelans, \"have the capacity of dialogue and understanding. Let's respect each other. Or is it that you are going to repeat a Vietnam in Latin America?\" Washington recently imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, specifically targeting its lucrative oil exports in an effort to undermine Maduro's income and loosen his grip on power. With the EU's Sunday deadline for Maduro to call elections having passed, a number of European nations officially declared themselves in the Guaid\u00f3 camp on Monday.  Germany joined Britain, France, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Portugal, Lithuania, Latvia and Spain -- a major blow given Spain's deep historic and economic ties with Venezuela -- in recognizing Guaid\u00f3 on Monday as the legitimate leader of the Venezuelan people. He also has the support of most of South America. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Monday that his government was, \"working for the return of full democracy in Venezuela: human rights, elections and no more political prisoners.\" He also touted efforts to get humanitarian aid into the economically ravaged nation. As CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer has reported from the streets of Caracas, Guaid\u00f3 has sought to keep up the pressure internally on Maduro as he gains international backing. Guaid\u00f3 routinely joins the massive demonstrations in the streets of the capital, including the biggest one to date over the weekend, where thousands of Venezuelans are demanding change from the top. The focus, as Palmer has reported, has been on pressuring Maduro's military commanders to abandon him and give their allegiance to Guaid\u00f3. Over the weekend the first senior member of Venezuela's military publically switch his loyalty to the \"interim\" government of Guaid\u00f3. Air force general Yanez Rodriguez said he was backing Guaid\u00f3, and claimed that 90 percent of the armed forces have lost faith in Maduro. But as Palmer reported over the weekeend, Maduro still has supporters, thousands of whom staged a counter-demonstration on Saturday in Caracas. A new poll suggests, however, that they're in the minority; after years of economic decay, corruption and violence, the poll showed 82 percent of Venezuelans want Maduro to quit.\u00a0 A meeting of senior leaders from 14 Latin American nations and Canada, known as the Lima Group, set for Monday in Ottawa was to focus on the standoff in Venezuela. All the countries involved have called for new elections in Venezuela, and this week they will discuss ways to increase the pressure on Maduro. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office said humanitarian aid for Venezuela -- routed through Guaid\u00f3 -- would be discussed in Ottawa. Getting foreign aid into the country, or even agreeing to do so, would be not only a humanitarian gesture but a highly symbolic and, for Maduro, emotive, signal that the obstinate president is losing control of his borders.",

Ted Cruz, has captured the national attention despite losing. He told \"60 Minutes\" shortly before the election that he was \"completely ruling out\" running for president for 2020, but he has since become more open to the idea. He hasn't taken the traditional path of a person considering running for president. Instead of going to the early primary states like Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina, he's taken a road-trip that he posted about on Medium. A social media phenomenon during the campaign, after the election, O'Rourke posted a video on Instagram about trips to the dentist and other random encounters. Other high-profile Democrats, such as Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Kamala Harris, have already announced they are running for president.\u00a0 O'Rourke said Tuesday that he felt a \"profound disappointment in myself, that I had let so many people down\" after the November election. The interview was a taping for Winfrey's program \"Oprah's SuperSoul Conversations from Times Square.\" Winfrey tried several times to get him to announce his 2020 plans, but O'Rourke insisted it was a decision he would make with his family. \"Where's Amy?\" Winfrey asked about O'Rourke's wife.\u00a0 One thing he has done in the past few months: Meet with former President Barack Obama. O'Rourke has been a Democratic congressman since 2012, but he said he had only limited interactions with Mr. Obama during that time. O'Rourke said Mr. Obama did not necessarily \"encourage\" him to run, but they discussed a 2020 run in more general terms.

The Kentucky Republican has promised a\u00a0\"Grim Reaper\" strategy\u00a0focused on burying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's legislative priorities, but without a robust GOP agenda it could prove unsatisfying for lawmakers facing restive voters ahead of 2020 elections. On Sunday, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote to the president asking for his \"urgent, personal intervention\" on gun violence.\u00a0 \"We implore you to seize this moment when your leadership and influence over the republicans in Congress on the issue of guns is so critical,\" they wrote.\u00a0 President Trump has not fully explained what he would like to see Congress accomplish, particularly on gun control, and McConnell is reluctant to venture too far, beyond confirming the White House's administrative and judicial nominees. That leaves big-ticket legislative victories highly unlikely as Pelosi's Democratic House churns out bills, the Republican Senate takes a pass, and the legislative calendar folds into campaign season. \"Senate Democrats must work to increase pressure on Leader McConnell to stop burying bills he doesn't like in his graveyard and to get the Senate working again,\" Schumer said in a letter to colleagues. One test of voter mood will come in\u00a0Tuesday's special election in North Carolina, where the Democrat for an open House seat, Marine veteran Dan McCready, faces Republican Dan Bishop, in a contest both parties see as toss-up. Mr. Trump is swooping in for a rally to push voters to the polls. As legislating makes way for campaigning, Sarah Binder, a professor at George Washington University, said by email, \"The challenge for both parties though is that they really do need something to deliver to voters in 2020.\" Mr. Trump does want Congress to pass the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal. And Congress needs to fund the government by the end of the month or risk another federal shutdown. But the president roiled talks\u00a0by shifting $3.6 billion\u00a0from military projects for the border wall and fallout continues over migrant detentions. Questions of impeachment hover. Gun regulation, perhaps more than other issues, is putting pressure on the Senate to act. August was bookended by devastating mass shootings across three cities that killed dozens and left scores more injured. Big business is stepping in to fill the void, with Walmart\u00a0becoming the latest to announce\u00a0limits on some ammunition sales. While a House-passed background checks bill stalled in the Senate, McConnell says he expects the White House to soon offer next steps. \"We're under discussion about what to do on the gun issue,\" McConnell said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show. McConnell has made it clear\u00a0that he won't make any moves without Mr. Trump's commitment to sign the bills into law. But the president has flip-flopped on guns, first suggesting he'd be open to background checks legislation or other measures to try to stem gun violence, only to backtrack after speaking to the National Rifle Association and others in the gun lobby. The Senate leader is trying to avoid a politically uncomfortable situation of Republicans joining Democrats to pass bills, only to have Trump reject them. Against this backdrop, McConnell outlined what he must see before considering any guns legislation: \"If the president is in favor of a number of things that he has discussed openly and publicly, and I know that if we pass it it'll become law, I'll put it on the floor.\" Senators from both parties have been meeting privately and with the White House on possible areas of agreement. Mr. Trump said he was talking with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who has a bipartisan background checks bill with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania that has failed in previous votes. Toomey, who said he has spoken several times with Mr. Trump over Congress' summer break, said the president has been more consistent in his support for expanding background checks than people give him credit for. \"The president has a real interest in doing something in this area,\" Toomey said. Several Republican senators are also now more interested but, he said, \"it's hard to say how this will turn out.\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who is also involved in talks, including with White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, said he is encouraged that the president may be interested in more narrow efforts, including his bipartisan bill with Toomey. It would require federal authorities to alert state officials when people trying to buy firearms are denied by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Before lawmakers left town for the six-week summer recess, senators from both parties bemoaned the way the world's most deliberative body has become what Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., calls a pricey lunch club. He too is working on gun legislation. \"I miss the Senate that used to spend the odd-year really legislating and really working on policy,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is up for reelection. \"We seem now to be caught up in a constant campaign and that is I think a disservice to the American people.\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and chairman of the Senate's health committee, is working on a bipartisan package of bills to lower health care costs. He said there's more happening than the public often sees on the endless loop of political and partisan fighting. \"We always have those two screens going on,\" said Alexander, who is retiring at the end of his term. \"While things could be much better in the United States Senate, there's a lot being done.\" McConnell has taken pride in stopping Democrats' agenda and is incorporating the \"Grim Reaper\" role in his own reelection campaign for 2020. The GOP leader,\u00a0who suffered a fractured shoulder\u00a0in a fall in early August, has been recovering at home in Kentucky but is expected to return to open the Senate on Monday. Asked about the Senate agenda for fall, his office had little to add. A spokesman sent a memo that included a long list of administrative nominees up for Senate confirmation.",

            "article_content": "Cedar Falls, Iowa\u00a0\u2014 In a quiet neighborhood down the road from the University of Northern Iowa, a group of women who refer to themselves as \"sisters for life\" have gathered at the home of Bonnie Anderson. Liz Miller, Janice Clark, Mary Schawke, and Lisa Sevcik each agree to have a second cup of peach iced tea from their host and despite disagreements on various political issues, they are able to come to a consensus on a few topics.\u00a0 \"I don't ever recall seeing this kind of a division in my lifetime,\" says Schawke. \"We kind of are in a civil war right now between Democrats and Republicans.\"\u00a0 The women are all on various sides of the political spectrum but on a breezy sunny afternoon, they're able to demonstrate that heated political debates in America can still take place with decency.\u00a0 Miller, in her 80s, is a staunch supporter of President Trump and often repeats lines word by word from the president. Clark, in her 70s, is a Democrat who is hungry for a candidate to unseat Mr. Trump in 2020. Anderson, 83, voted twice for President Obama and then -- like many others in Iowa -- supported the Republican nominee in 2016.\u00a0 Schawke, 63, also voted for Mr. Trump but admits she will be keeping an eye on the eventual Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, Sevick, in her 50s, calls herself a lifelong Republican but opted to vote Democrat in 2016 and doesn't see herself supporting Mr. Trump this time around either.\u00a0 During a two hour conversation that turns hostile at times, the women often stop to remind themselves of their respect for each other. The longtime friends are part of the Cedar Falls Woman's Club, a chapter of the General Federation of Women's Clubs that dates back to 1914. The group holds formal meetings on the first Wednesday of each month from September through May and currently has more than 90 members.\u00a0 Schwake, a small business owner, thinks part of the reason for the division in the country is because Democrats \"started pouting like little children\" when Hillary Clinton lost the general election in 2016. She says she \"didn't like it\" when Mr. Obama won but \"respected our new president,\" adding, \"when Trump won, it has just been a battle royale.\" In Iowa, 31 of the state's 99 counties flipped to Mr. Trump during 2016 election after voting for Mr. Obama in 2008 and 2012. Anderson is one of those voters, and while she says \"Trump is doing some good,\" she now regrets voting for him because of the way he \"belittles people.\" \"That bothers me so much\" Anderson says before she is interrupted by Miller, sitting next to her on the couch with arms crossed. \"I don't see anything. He belittled you? Did he?\" Miller asks. Miller, who manages a farm that has been with her family for more than a century, says \"the average people\" who voted for Mr. Trump \"don't give a dang\" about how he talks and acts.\u00a0 \"I think he's doing great for the United States,\" Miller says. \"People don't like his personality, so what?\"\u00a0 There is some sense of anxiety in the room about the future of the economy and Anderson, breaking up the brief moment of silence after she is questioned by Miller, begins to express her unease about the recent returns on her investments. \u00a0 \"I am afraid of a recession, I really am,\" Anderson says. \"I have seen those investments going down on a daily basis and I know there are millions of others who have investments and the same thing is going to happen. That is scary.\"\u00a0 While there is disagreement about the future of America's economy, these Iowans all concur that family farming is becoming \"obsolete.\" Schawke, with a disappointed expression on her face, says \"a small farmer can't raise a family in this economy.\"\u00a0 Miller says her youngest son, in his 50s, is a farmer who hasn't made a profit in the last three years. \"He is just hand to mouth. He is just breaking even,\" Miller says. \"It's like he's not working at all and he needs to be getting another job.\" The group is split when it comes to the way Mr. Trump has handled trade negotiations with China. Miller says \"it is time for China to break. They were just screwing us.\" Clark, sitting across the room doesn't think China will back down. \"They don't need us,\" Clark says, adding the situation makes her very sad. \"I hate to see my country go down in this area because of that.\"\u00a0 Schawke, who grew up on a farm, admits that the trade war with China is hurting farmers in Iowa and across the country. But she says, \"If we give in then we are weak,\" adding that she admires the president for \"sticking to his guns and saying 'no' to China.\"\u00a0 The only one at this gathering who's not an official member of the woman's club is Sevick. She wants to talk about guns in America and questions why she has to \"worry about going to Walmart.\" \"It makes no sense that they are allowing people to buy machine type guns. I hope we can do something about that,\" Sevick says as Miller and Schawke interrupt her to say \"guns don't kill people.\"\u00a0 \"The gun is a tool,\" Schawke says with a stern tone in her voice. She adds the \"terrorists\" who are shooting people are \"mentally ill.\"\u00a0 For Schawke, the matter is personal because she is a registered gun owner and has a permit to carry but she also has a son who is mentally ill. She says \"we have to change the treatment of the mentally ill,\" and \"help with their disease.\" The group is also torn about the treatment of families at the Southern border. They want the controversial detention centers to remain in place but agree that children should not be separated from their parents.\u00a0 Anderson says \"parents should know they are going to be separated\" and questioned why families even involve their kids in the arduous journey when the threat of separation looms at the U.S. border. Clark answered her question without hesitation saying \"because they are desperate.\"\u00a0 Clark is now looking forward to the 2020 presidential race and says her \"heart goes out to Warren,\" referring to the Massachusetts senator who is one of the front runners for the Democratic nomination. Anderson says she is \"not sure\" which side she will support in 2020 after voting for the Democratic ticket twice and then switching up to the Republicans in 2016.\u00a0 \"I don't have full confidence in Biden but if they come up with a stronger candidate, I probably would vote Democrat,\" she says.\u00a0 Miller predicts a \"landslide\" reelection victory for Mr. Trump in 2020 and says the he has her full support. Schawke said she doesn't put the president \"on a pedestal,\" and admits her support is \"wavering more than it was a year or two ago.\"\u00a0 \"I am torn,\" Schwake said. \"For the most part he's leading our country in the right direction but he doesn't act very presidential and he insults people.\" CBS News reporter covering the intersection between politics and tech.",

            "article_content": "Former Pennsylvania congressman and retired three-star admiral Joe Sestak announced Sunday that he is running for president, becoming the\u00a025th candidate\u00a0to seek the Democratic nomination. Sestak, a Vietnam War veteran who also served in Iraq and Afghanistan, made his announcement\u00a0in a video\u00a0posted to his campaign website. At his first campaign event in Waterloo, Iowa, Sestak told an audience of four caucus-goers that \"Americans want someone they can trust.\" \"Americans want someone who is accountable to them above self, above party, and above any special interest,\" Sestak said. \"They want a President that has a depth of global experience to restore U.S. leadership to the world and to protect our American dream at home.\" Sestak, who served in the Navy for more than 31 years, joins a historically crowded field of Democrats looking to take on President Trump in 2020. In a\u00a0recent CBS News/YouGov poll\u00a0of registered Democrats in early primary states, 71% said there are too many choices. In his announcement video, Sestak explained he joined the race later than other candidates because his daughter was battling brain cancer. \"The decision to delay was so I would be there with Alex, our daughter, as the brain cancer she courageously beaten at four years old returned this past year.\" He noted that his daughter \"has again overcome the single-digit odds.\" The retired admiral told reporters in Waterloo he plans to get his message out in the field of 24 other candidates \"step by step.\" He added that voters \"want to know if I know them, not if you just know me and the policies.\" Sestak defeated 10-term Pennsylvania Republican Wayne Curtis Weldon in 2007 for a House seat and won reelection in 2009 in a traditionally red district. He said his daughter's initial battle against cancer inspired him to serve in the House \"in order to work for all Americans to have health care coverage we fortunately had for Alex.\" Sestak said he will work on having a public option for health care right away, but added millions of Americans have some form of private health care and cautioned against immediately eliminating private health insurance. He said he wants to see \"a transition of choice,\" so that voters who prefer private insurance don't have to \"change their health care plan in two to four years.\" The former congressman touted his record as a Democrat in Pennsylvania's traditionally red 7th District while pushing for progressive policies like universal background checks for gun owners and supporting a woman's choice to reproductive health care. While speaking to potential caucus-goers, Sestak highlighted his experience in national security and said that \"an illiberal world order is beginning to emerge.\" He described the Trump administration's actions internationally as bordering isolationism and warned that America's \"retreat from the world will lead to the contraction of the American dream.\" Sestak, who commanded an aircraft carrier battle group that conducted combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, called the U.S. withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Deal \"embarrassing.\" \"We broke our word when Iran kept theirs,\" Sestak said. He also cautioned against launching air strikes on Iranian facilities and infrastructure. \"It will take us weeks if not months to destroy all of their air defense systems. This is not Iraq, this is a sophisticated air defense system where they have hundreds of missiles that can reign down on Israel, our regional bases, allies in the region, in the weeks it takes to find them and destroy them.\" Sestak also spoke at length about China's growing influence in the world though its Belt and Road initiative. He said the program has left some countries \"enslaved to China\" because they can't pay off their debts. He called climate change the \"most catastrophic threat to America and the world,\" and added there is nothing the U.S \"can do by ourselves\" to solve the issue. Sestak warned that concerns of climate change could lead to \"violent wars\" due to lack of \"diminished natural resources.\" Sestak also ran for Senate in Pennsylvania in 2010 and 2016. In 2010, Sestak defeated Sen. Arlen Specter in the primary but lost to Republican Pat Toomey by two points in the general election. Six years later, he lost by 10 points in the primary to Katie McGinty, a former secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. McGinty lost to Toomey in the general election.",

            "article_content": "Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa on Saturday kicked off what could be a hard-fought re-election campaign as Democrats eye the perennial swing state. The freshman senator urged an enthusiastic crowd that she needs their support to help \"stamp out socialism,\" citing policy proposals from some of the Democratic presidential candidates.\u00a0 \"We can't take our way of life for granted because the very values that make up the heart and the soul of our state are under attack,\" Ernst said. \"The radical left will stop at nothing until socialism has spread from coast to coast.\" The junior senator from Iowa announced her re-election campaign at her signature Roast and Ride event with several hundred supporters attending. Ernst began the day by leading about 250 motorcycle riders on a 49-mile journey from Des Moines to Boone. Some supporters honked as she passed by and one man waved a large American flag as she rode by him. Ernst won 53% of the vote in 2014 for retiring Democrat Tom Harkin's seat, and Democrats are hoping to take the seat back, especially as President Trump's tariffs have hit the state hard. Ernst already has at least three Democrats challenging her: Theresa Greenfield, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2018 and is president of a real estate company, business owner Eddie Mauro and attorney Kimberly Graham. Democrats need to pick up four seats in 2020 to regain majority control of the Senate, but Ernst vowed she'll be returning to Washington. \u00a0\u00a0 \"I know that this is an important seat that the Democrats would love to have back,\" Ernst told reporters. \"I am going to make them fight for it and they are going to fail. I am going to hold this seat.\" Ernst highlighted a relationship with Mr. Trump, saying he's always welcome to campaign in Iowa, a state he won in 2016. Despite linking herself to some of the president's policies like border security and appointing conservative judges, Ernst said she's not afraid to push back on issues where they disagree, including tariffs.\u00a0 \"I've talked to the president, he knows that I'm not necessarily a tariff gal, but he will tell me, 'well I'm a tariff guy,'\" Ernst said. She added that she's spoken to farmers in Iowa who are \"okay with his stance on China.\" In a statement, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price criticized Ernst's record in Washington, including her votes for Mr. Trump's tax cut and to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \"Iowans won't forget Ernst's broken promises and Democrats are building a ground game to make sure voters know the truth about Ernst's record of putting political ambitions above the best interests of the Hawkeye State,\" Price said. Ernst brought out some of her supporters, including her fellow senator from Iowa, Chuck Grassley, Gov. Kim Reynolds and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. Haley went after the 2020 Democratic presidentials contenders, who have been campaigned heavily due to Iowa's first-in-the-nation contest, calling them \"a really odd collection of liberals, radicals and socialists.\" \"And I know a lot about liberals, radicals and socialists. In case you forgot, I used to work at the United Nations,\" Haley said. She continued her jabs at the U.N., calling it an \"unusual place\" due to the criticism the U.S. sometimes faces from other members. \"Nowhere else in the country can you hear America being denounced in 10 different languages at the same time, unless of course you're at any of our college campuses,\" Haley said. Republicans at the Roast and Ride echoed the statements from Ernst and Haley that the Democratic Party, and its presidential candidates, are moving too far left. \"There is a sense of radicalism and left-leaning opinions from the majority of the (presidential) campaigns,\" said Randy Weisheit, a small business owner from Ankeny, Iowa.\u00a0 \"I think it's going away from what the country was founded on,\" said Darryl Jessen, from Iowa Falls. Some Democrats have chosen to embrace the \"socialism\" label, with a 2018 Gallup poll found 37% of Americans viewed socialism favorably, up two points from 2016. And this week, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has been polling in second place,\u00a0defended what he calls \"democratic socialism.\"\u00a0 Republicans at Ernst's event criticized some of the policies he supports, including Medicare for All and free public college. Others candidates, such as former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and former U.S. Rep. John Delaney, have\u00a0cautioned against embracing socialism.\u00a0 Ernst also said she's working to complete another tour of Iowa's 99 counties. It would be her fifth time doing so and she says it helps her keep a relationship with her constituents. \"Every Iowan has a voice that deserves to be heard,\" Ernst said. \"How can you push for the needs of the communities in your state when you don't travel across your state and hear straight from those folks?\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Among the collection of T-shirts sold on Elizabeth Warren's campaign website, there is one that encapsulates her approach to the campaign so far: \"Warren has a plan for that.\" It's undoubtedly true that Warren, among the nearly two-dozen Democrats running for president in 2020, has the most detailed policy platform. She wants to break up big tech and protect public lands. She wants to abolish the Electoral College and implement a new \"ultra-millionaires tax.\" She wants to relieve student debt, decrease mortality rates during child birth among black women, and break up the big technology companies.\u00a0 Warren has taken a clear stand on just about every major political issue facing the country, and even some more esoteric ones, while many of her opponents eschew policy minutiae. She has a vision. She has an agenda.\u00a0 And despite being the first major candidate to enter the race last December, she's lagging in the polls.\u00a0 In 2016, Warren's progressive bonafides had liberals begging her to challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. The activist group MoveOn planned to spend $1 million on a \"Draft Warren\" effort. But Warren ultimately demurred, giving Sen. Bernie Sanders a clear path to challenge Clinton from the left.\u00a0 This year, Warren is trailing in the money race. In the first quarter of 2019, she raised $6 million in donations \u2014 although she did have $12 million left in her account from her 2018 Senate race. Sanders, meanwhile, pulled in $18 million. California Sen. Kamala Harris raised $12 million, and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke brought in a $9 million haul. In his first day as a declared candidate last week, former Vice President Joe Biden raised $6.3 million, which is more than Warren had brought in after months on the trail.\u00a0 Even Pete Buttigieg, the small-town mayor and subject of several glowing profiles, raised $7 million in the first quarter.\u00a0 Depending on who you ask, there's no shortage of reasons why Warren might be struggling at this early stage of the campaign. Her first finance director departed early, disagreeing with Warren's resolution not to spend time holding large fundraisers. She has a polarizing reputation, in part due to questions surrounding her claimed Native American heritage. In her solidly Democratic home state of Massachusetts, she received fewer votes in the 2018 election than Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican who was also up for re-election.\u00a0 The Iowa caucus is nine months away, the first Democratic debate is at the end of June, and the race is just beginning to take shape. \"Warren has a plan for that.\" But are her plans enough to propel her to the front of the pack? Warren has been squarely in the middle in most polls, although a few recent ones have shown her on the rise. According to FiveThirtyEight, Warren is averaging at fifth place in the polls, with numbers in the high single digits. A CNN poll published Tuesday, however, did find Warren in third place with 8 percent support, and a Quinnipiac poll showed Warren in second place with 12 percent support. Although Biden leads in these two polls by 25 percentage points, Warren's camp hopes this mild surge in support means her policy-first campaign is finally gaining traction with voters.\u00a0 \"Elizabeth's ideas are all about one central goal: to make government, our economy, and our democracy work for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected,\" John Donenberg, the policy director for the Warren campaign, told CBS News. \"Every proposal tackles this same issue within its relevant context.\" Donenberg leads a small team, with most members having worked with Warren in the Senate. The campaign's policy proposals stem from Warren's work in the Senate and \"decades of Elizabeth's research and advocacy.\" Donenberg said Warren often consults experts when developing her plans. She spoke with affordable housing groups like the National Low Income Housing Coalition and leaders like Darrick Hamilton and Mehrsa Baradaran when developing her proposal to address the legacy of redlining and decrease the racial wealth gap. Warren's campaign says her political views are shaped by her personal experience, and \"having a plan\" has been part of her presidential campaign since the beginning. She often discusses how her father lost his job and eventually wound up as a janitor. Her two parents, both earning minimum wage, were able to support Warren. But she says minimum wage alone is no longer enough to raise a family, so we must tax the wealthy to pay for universal childcare.\u00a0 \"She's lived opportunity and wants that for every kid in America,\" Donenberg said. \"Her life's work has been about understanding why America's middle class is being hollowed out, and why families of color face an even rockier path to building a future.\" Biden, the early frontrunner for the nomination, has a page on his website titled \"Joe's Vision.\" The main points of his vision are rebuilding the middle class, making the U.S. respected abroad, and making sure \"democracy includes everyone.\"\u00a0 There are several paragraphs addressing issues like \"Restoring the basic bargain for American workers,\" but no concrete policy proposals. Biden's campaign is several months younger than Warren's, but it is still far less thorough in describing what \"Joe's Vision\" is and how it would be implemented. Buttigieg receives much attention from the press and has recently shot to the middle in early polls. At 37, he is the youngest candidate in the race, and would be the first openly gay president. But while many voters are attracted to Buttigieg, a polyglot Rhodes Scholar and veteran who emphasizes his Midwest roots, he's largely stayed away from detailed policy proposals.\u00a0 Sanders' website has several pages outlining his major policies, like his signature promise to expand Medicare to cover all Americans and to pass a Green New Deal. Having spent several decades in politics advocating for democratic socialism, he often articulates a vision for broadly transforming the economy.\u00a0 But many of Warren's policy proposals are more specific, even bordering on granular, as evidenced by her plan to combat high maternal mortality rates among black women and her step-by-step plan addressing student debt. On his website, meanwhile, Sanders says he would \"substantially lower student debt\" without saying specifically how. Warren and Sanders have often been grouped together given their shared emphasis on expanding social services and their critique of the economic system. Some of her supporters are concerned that voters who may have been drawn to Warren will instead flock to Sanders, who has performed well in the polls and mounted a surprisingly strong race in 2016.\u00a0 However, it is just as possible that potential Sanders supporters would eventually drift toward Warren, said Christina Reynolds, the vice president for communications at Emily's List, a group that supports Democratic women running for office.\u00a0 \"I think Elizabeth Warren draws some would-be supporters away from Bernie,\" Reynolds, whose group has not yet endorsed a 2020 presidential candidate, said. \"I suspect some of their supporters are having a tough time deciding which one to support.\" Sanders isn't the only candidate running on a platform similar, but less detailed, than Warren's. Harris and Sen. Cory Booker also support \"Medicare for All,\" and voters who may support universal health care but are wary of Sanders' socialism could turn to any of them instead. Women can face more intense scrutiny when running for president than men. But according to Kelly Dittmar, an associate research professor at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, Warren's emphasis on policy could help her sidestep deeply-rooted stereotypes.\u00a0 \"Women candidates are likely to put out more policy plans because that's an area where they have historically been questioned,\" Dittmar said.\u00a0 But putting out policy plans isn't enough. Women also must tackle the \"likability\" factor: If a woman is too wonky, she might be considered unapproachable, Dittmar said. But if she's too vague, voters might question why she is running. This issue is compounded for women of color in the race, like Harris, who must also battle the notion that the presidency is an office that should be held by white men. Reynolds said Warren was not campaigning on policy alone, and did have the same kind of vision for the future for which male candidates have been praised. \"Elizabeth Warren has a lot of policy. She also has a vision that drives that policy,\" Reynolds said.\u00a0 Reynolds also questioned why the idea of \"electability\" was used as a metric to judge any candidate, and particularly women.\u00a0 \"Literally our last two presidents, including Donald Trump, were viewed as unelectable almost until the day that they were elected,\" Reynolds said.\u00a0 Still, polls have repeatedly shown that Democratic primary voters are thinking long and hard about electability, and many have their doubts that Warren could beat President Trump.\u00a0 New Hampshire is a state where Massachusetts candidates like Warren typically do quite well, but a Suffolk University survey of Granite State Democrats released earlier this week had her in fourth place behind Biden, Sanders and Buttigieg. When asked why, nearly 1-in-5 non-Warren voters said the main reason they don't support her is because they doubt she can beat Mr. Trump.\u00a0 Warren challenged the concept of electability at the forum last week hosted by She the People, an organization which seeks to promote women of color in politics. When asked about Democrats who were anxious about nominating a woman after Clinton's 2016 defeat, Warren said voters needed to fight for the principles that matter to them. \"We've got a roomful of people here who weren't given anything. We have a roomful of people here who had to fight for what they believe in,\" Warren said, speaking to an audience largely composed of women of color. \"Are we going to show up for people that we didn't actually believe in because we were too afraid to do anything else? That's not who we are. That's not how we're going to do this.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Our series Three Meals reveals what is on voters' minds across the country. In this installment, CBS News contributor Steve Inskeep visited three cities in Virginia to talk with voters over breakfast, lunch and dinner. In Virginia, voters who were sometimes sitting inches from each other are not likely to agree on issues, including on the impeachment of President Donald Trump. At Tommy's Restaurant in Hampton, five workers at a nearby Navy shipyard, who had breakfast after their night shift, see a strong economy. So strong, for Scott Siebert, who supports president Trump, that he hardly cares about impeachment. \"I have not had a chance to watch any of it,\" he said. Siebert has a different anxiety: Second Amendment rights. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam wants a newly Democratic-led state legislature to strengthen gun laws after a mass shooting in nearby Virginia Beach. \"Northam trying to take guns. I think the Second Amendment covers it. I don't see where legally he can do it,\" Siebert said. Sitting a few feet away from the shipyard workers, Sandy and Leroy Schifflet have a very different view on impeachment. \"It's not going to go anywhere, but he definitely did need to be impeached,\" Sandy Schifflet said. She doesn't think Mr. Trump will be removed from office, but still thinks it was worth impeaching him. \"He definitely earned it, and he needs to be taken down a peg or two,\" she said.\u00a0 The debate heard at Tommy's is part of a long-running debate in the country that's gone on for centuries. The battle over impeachment has some of its roots in Colonial Williamsburg. The legislators in the state capitol once included James Madison, father of the U.S. Constitution and advocate of the separation of powers, including the separation between Congress and the president. Today that divided government reflects a divided nation, including voters torn within themselves. At the Mason-Dixon Cafe in Fredericksburg, Tracy and Dan Fisher recall voting in 2016. \"At the voting station, a person says \u2014 looks at me, sees that I'm rather largely pregnant, and says, 'Oh, do you want one ballot or two?' And quicker than I could stop it coming out of my mouth, I said, 'Well, I guess it depends on who I'm voting for, on whether or not this person deserves a ballot, has rights,'\" Tracy Fisher, a government contractor, said. That remark focused her mind on what she calls her \"passion for the unborn.\" Tracy and Dan both voted for Mr. Trump. \"Somebody watching this is going to understand what you're saying about standing up for people who don't have a voice, but then they're going to say what about migrant children? What about kids separated from their parents?\" Inskeep asked.\u00a0 \"One of our, as a family, greatest disappointments has been to watch people taken at the border and split up,\" Dan, a physical therapist, said. \"I'm proud to be an American, but America's not the only country. And our job should be to be a beacon of hope and light to the people around us.\" The Fishers said they still cannot vote for a Democrat who favors abortion rights, but they see another moral choice: withholding a vote from the president. \"I'm not voting. I'm happy not to vote,\" Tracy said. In the suburbs of Washington, D.C., which have made Virginia far more diverse and Democratic, the owner of an Indian restaurant called Namaste is an immigrant from Nepal. Raj Chaulagain, who has been a citizen since 2016, now owns two restaurants and employs more than 20 people.\u00a0 He got here through a visa program, the diversity lottery, which the president has wanted to end. \"I don't like it... We need a lot of people to work here also,\" Chaulagain said. The region's diversity makes it vibrant, though it also makes some diners anxious. \"It's almost become like sin to say anything that is not seen as politically correct in that what's defined as politically correct keeps changing,\" said Mark Loftus, a federal worker. While Loftus sounds a bit conservative, Sally Eissler at the next table has volunteered for Democratic candidates and favored impeaching a polarizing president. \"We're not together as a country,\" Eissler said. \"I don't ever remember a time in my life where I didn't think that we were all one. Even if we didn't agree.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Pierce Bush, a grandson of late President George H.W. Bush, announced that he would run for Congress on Monday. The nonprofit executive will be running for Texas' 22nd Congressional district in the Houston area, an open seat after Representative Pete Olson announced his retirement in July. He joins a crowded Republican primary with a familiar name. Former President George W. Bush, who also served as governor of Texas, is his uncle. His father Neil Bush is a well-known businessman and investor and his cousin George P. Bush is the Texas land commissioner.\u00a0 \"We face a very challenging time in our nation,\" Pierce Bush said in a\u00a0Twitter video\u00a0announcing his candidacy. \"And on the brink of losing a generation to an idea that socialism and free stuff are the answers for their future. But we all know that socialism has failed everywhere and everyone.\" \"It's time for new leaders to stand for conservatism that empowers all Americans, placing individuals above governments and ensuring that we all have the freedom to achieve success in life.\" Republican Party of Texas spokesperson Sam Pohl confirmed the party has received Bush's filing. The deadline for federal filings in Texas is Monday afternoon. \"I think the race is going to be tough due to the number of folks who have entered. It definitely proves the excitement Republicans feel ahead of the 2020 election,\" Pohl said. The Republican primary will be held in March. If no candidate gets more that 50% of the vote, there will be a run-off in May.\u00a0 Bush's competitors include Republican candidates like Kathleen Wall, who spent $6 million for a 2018 race in Texas' 2nd District, and county judge Greg Hill.\u00a0 \"While I have great respect for the Bush family, I have strong doubts about any candidate who would try to parachute into our district and buy this seat,\" said Hill, a former Border Patrol agent. \"This is not West Houston, and unless you've actually lived here and worked here and raised a family here, you cannot begin to understand the issues we face.\" In addition to facing a primary where nine other Republican candidates have already filed according to the Texas Secretary of State's office, three Democrats have filed and been raising money, including former foreign service officer and former Congressional adviser Sri Preston Kulkarni. Kulkarni came within 5 points of winning the seat in 2018 and has raised more than\u00a0$800,000\u00a0for his 2020 bid so far. Tight races like Kulkarni's 2018 bid are indicative of how Texas has\u00a0grown more competitive. Democrats point to changing demographics in the state and that six of the seats Republicans kept after 2018's midterms were won by only 5 points or less. Incumbent Republicans in three of those seats have announced they would not seek re-election in 2020. The\u00a0thought\u00a0from national and state Democrats is that this will create a very expensive GOP primary in March and draw it out into a runoff in May. \"While Republicans are battling it out and facing down the prospects of a long and expensive primary, Democrats are gearing up to take back the district and win in the increasingly diverse Fort Bend County,\" said Texas Democrats spokesperson Abhi Rahman. \u00a0 Pierce Bush had his name originally floated for the state's 7th Congressional District, which his grandfather once represented. He is currently the CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters Lone Star. \"For the past seven and a half years it has been my honor to work with dedicated volunteers who have invested their life in the lives of thousands of kids in Fort Bend, Brazoria and Harris Counties,\" he said in his\u00a0announcement.

            "article_content": "President Trump targeted who he called the \"hateful\" and \"enraged\" Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry and his Texas challenger Beto O'Rourke during a nearly 90-minute campaign rally in Dallas on Thursday. Mr. Trump's rally was held one day after a tense meeting with Democratic congressional leaders, where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi walked out after he called her a \"third-rate politician.\"\u00a0 \"The more America achieves, the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become,\" Mr. Trump said, drawing boos from the crowd.\u00a0 \"At stake is the survival of American democracy itself,\" he added. \"They are destroying this country, but we will never let it happen.\" \u00a0 It didn't take Mr. Trump long to discuss the impeachment inquiry. He defended what he called a \"perfect\" July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, and slammed House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. \"Shifty Schiff makes up my conversation, which was perfect, so he made up a totally false conversation with the Ukrainian president,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 And while Mr. Trump didn't spend much time discussing allegations that he threatened to withhold foreign aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Joe Biden, he zeroed in on what he called the \"terrible foreign corruption of the Bidens.\" Mr. Trump has made unsupported accusations of impropriety against\u00a0Biden and his son Hunter, who was employed\u00a0by an energy company in Ukraine, which Biden has denied.\u00a0 Just miles away, O'Rourke was hosting a counter rally called the \"Rally Against Fear.\" According to O'Rourke's campaign, there were over 5,000 in attendance at that rally, which also featured Democrats competing to run against Republican Senator John Cornyn. O'Rourke called out what he described as the \"false, bullsh*t fear of Donald Trump.\"\u00a0 O'Rourke, who has made gun control a central theme of his campaign, was the first Democratic candidate Mr. Trump targeted during the rally. Mr. Trump called O'Rourke \"a very dumb Democrat candidate for president,\" and tore into the 2020 contender for his stance on guns and his proposal to end tax exemptions for religious organizations that oppose same-sex marriages. \u00a0 \"Beto, in a few short weeks, got rid of guns and got rid of religion,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Those are not two good things in Texas to get rid of.\" \u00a0 Mr. Trump slammed Democrats for engaging in what he called \"endless wars,\" and heralded the \"tremendous success\" of reaching a five-day ceasefire agreement with Turkey. \u00a0 \"These wars brought mass chaos, instability, destruction, and death,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Today, we choose a different path.\" \"Without spilling American blood \u2014  \u00a0not one drop of American blood \u2014 we've all agreed on a pause or a ceasefire in the border region of Syria,\" Mr. Trump added.\u00a0 \"Sometimes you've gotta let them fight,\" he continued. \"Like two kids in a lot, you have to let them fight, and then you pull them apart.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump finished by claiming that his election may have been the best ever, with the possible exception of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, and urged his supporters to elect him for another four years.\u00a0 \"Once we do, it will be very hard to take this beautiful experiment apart,\" he said. \u00a0 Dallas police arrested an armed adult man wearing body armor at the rally, CBS Dallas Fort Worth reports. The man revealed he had a license to carry the weapon, but was still taken into custody and brought to a local hospital for evaluation.

            "article_content": "London \u2014 The pound dropped Tuesday to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, excluding a brief \"flash crash\" in 2016 that may have been caused by technical glitches, as international investors fret about a political showdown over Brexit this week. The British currency fell as low as $1.1960, down almost a cent on the day before stabilizing around $1.1990.  Not counting the brief plunge in the autumn of 2016, in which the currency fell to $1.1789 for about two minutes before recovering, the pound is now at its lowest level in 34 years. Brexit is facing a crucial few days as lawmakers challenge Prime Minister Boris Johnson's insistence that the U.K. will leave the European Union on Oct. 31, with or without a deal. Parliament was returning from its summer recess Tuesday with a key piece of legislation on its agenda that would see it take control of the Parliament's agenda. If that passes, the lawmakers are expected to vote to block the government from bringing the country out of the EU without a deal, which many experts say would cause chaos for people and businesses as border checks and tariffs resume, among other things. Johnson has tried to crack down on members of his Conservative Party who oppose his Brexit plans, warning them they would be expelled from the party if they supported parliamentary efforts to block or delay Brexit. Johnson's office also says he would call an early election, with uncertain consequences. \"Markets are extremely negative about the consequences of a no-deal scenario,\" said Alex Kuptsikevich, analyst at online brokerage FxPro. \"The pound will have a hard time if the (lawmakers') initiatives fail.\" The pound has become the main indicator of international investors' confidence in Britain's economy. Its fall effectively makes British people poorer as they can spend less on travel and foreign goods, which become pricier. It helps British exporters, however, as well as the many multinationals based in the country that make most of their money in other countries and currencies. Oil companies like Shell and BP make their money in dollars around the world, converting that back to pounds when they report earnings, so the pound's drop is generally a boost to them. It's a similar story for global bank HSBC, mining firms Antofagasta and Rio Tinto and consumer goods producer Unilever. That's why the main stock index, the FTSE 100, has actually held up well in the face of the Brexit chaos. While the pound is down almost 7% this year, the stock index is up 8%. Stocks focused on Britain's own economy, however, have fared more poorly. The fall in the pound can also make British companies more vulnerable to takeovers from abroad as they effectively become cheaper to buy. Foreign takeovers of British companies jumped after the June 2016 Brexit referendum, when the pound fell around 10% from over $1.500. They have increased again this year as the pound slipped again.",

            "article_content": "Congressman David Cicilline will be the first U.S. lawmaker to join an extraordinary collection of global officials investigating the spread of disinformation and \"fake news\" on social media.\u00a0 The International Grand Committee on Disinformation and \"Fake News\"  now comprises lawmakers from a dozen countries aggressively examining the role of social media, in particular Facebook, in efforts to influence elections and culture.\u00a0 Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who serves as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, said in the statement that the internet has \"become concentrated, less open, and growingly hostile to innovation.\"\u00a0 \"This is a problem that transcends borders, and it requires multinational cooperation to craft solutions that foster competition and safeguard privacy online,\" Cicilline said. \"I look forward to joining the International Grand Committee as part of its historic effort to identify problems in digital markets and chart a path forward that leads to a better online experience for everyone.\"\u00a0 Hildegarde Naughton, chair of Ireland's Oireachtas Communications Committee, said Cicilline is joining an investigation that has a \"particular responsibility\" to pursue \"greater regulation of social media and tech giants. \"We will coordinate actions to tackle online election interference, 'fake news', and harmful online communications, amongst other issues while at the same time respecting freedom of speech,\" Naughton said. In an email to CBS News, a spokesperson for Naughton said the lawmaker personally invited\u00a0for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0to attend when she met him in Dublin earlier this year. Zuckerberg and others will soon be sent formal invitations, the spokesperson said. At its two previous hearings in London and Ottawa, Canada, the committee has included lawmakers from Britain, Canada, Singapore, Saint Lucia, Ireland, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Germany, Mexico, Morocco and Estonia. At each hearing, seats have been left empty\u00a0Zuckerberg \u2014 who has rebuffed repeated calls to appear \u2014 as lower-level executives have borne the wrath of angry legislators.\u00a0 Cicilline's commitment comes as the committee gears up for a hearing of particular significance for Facebook and Zuckerberg. The company employs a large workforce in Ireland, running a massive data center that is core to its international operation. As a result, Ireland's Data Protection Commission has unusual power compared to other countries to regulate and fine Facebook. At the committee's most recent hearing in Ottawa, Canada in late May, Facebook executives   Neil Potts and Kevin Chan were questioned about the company's decision not to block an infamous video that was altered to make U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi appear drunk. Potts and Chan then watched as the Canadian contingent voted to subpoena their bosses. \"Should Mr. Zuckerberg or (Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl) Sandberg come to Canada for any reason, for a tech conference or to go fishing, they should be served a summons,\" said Canadian Member of Parliament Charlie Angus. Canada is\u00a0the second country to which Zuckerberg cannot travel\u00a0without expecting to be immediately summoned to appear before government officials. After the International Grand Committee met for the first time in London last year \u2014 a meeting Zuckerberg declined to attend \u2014 the head of a British committee investigating disinformation told CBS News that if Zuckerberg ever steps foot in England he can expect a visit from authorities. \u00a0 \u00a0\"If Mark Zuckerberg came to the U.K., we would serve a summons on him and if he refused to accept that summons then we could start contempt proceedings against him,\" Damian Collins, the chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee in the U.K. Parliament, said in a February interview. \u00a0 At that hearing, Facebook executive Richard Allen was grilled on issues ranging from the company's failure to block posts in Sri Lanka encouraging people to \"kill all Muslims\" to secret internal company documents seized by the committee's British Members of Parliament. Singapore's Edwin Tong asked why a post in Sri Lanka saying \"kill all Muslims\" was allowed to stay up, calling it an \"egregious mistake.\" Tong said when a Sri Lankan government official pushed Facebook about the post, the company replied initially, \"This post does not break any specific rules.\" \u00a0 Graham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.

            "article_content": "The candidates who qualified for the second democratic presidential debate in Detroit later this month were just announced, CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice reports. Here's who made the cut:\u00a0 Missing on stage: Sen. Mike Gravel, Mayor Wayne Messam, Rep. Joe Sestak and Tom Steyer. CNN, which will be broadcasting the debate, will hold a live drawing on Thursday evening to see who will appear each night of the two-day event. ***And a quick programming note*** If you're interested in getting an up close look at our team as they cover the 2020 campaign trail, you can follow them on Instagram \u2013\u00a0@2020trailmarkers\u00a0\u2013 for the latest on their travels, stories and behind-the-scenes view of the candidates. MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG:\u00a0The South Bend mayor released his Douglass Plan last week, aimed at addressing systemic racism in various policy areas. And while he's calling it \"the most comprehensive plan\" that has been put forth in this campaign to uplift black Americans, he continues to struggle in engaging this group. In South Carolina, 60% of the Democratic electorate is expected to be African American in the 2020 election and some voters feel that even with a plan targeted at uplifting black communities, Buttigieg still might struggle to connect with one voting bloc in the state \u2014 black churchgoers. The Buttigieg camp says he plans to meet publicly and privately with church leaders and their congregations throughout South Carolina. CBS News campaign reporters\u00a0LaCrai Mitchell and Jack Turman\u00a0spoke\u00a0to black pastors throughout the state who discussed the history of the black church and explained why the openly gay and millennial mayor may have trouble connecting with southern black churchgoers, who tend to be more socially conservative. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS:\u00a0Harris separated herself from Sanders on Wednesday by stating that she opposes a middle class tax hike to pay for Medicare for All. The California senator said this in an interview with CNN Wednesday morning. Harris also admitted she thinks it may take more than four years to transition the country to a Medicare for All plan. She was pressed on how the plan would be paid for without a middle class tax increase. CNN also noted that the plan is estimated to cost around $30 trillion over 10 years. The campaign told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Stephanie Ramirez:\u00a0\"A number of measures have been proposed as potential revenue raisers to pay for Medicare for All. Sanders and other experts have probably put out more than a dozen ideas, one of which is increasing middle class taxes. That one is off the table for Kamala. She believes we can raise revenues by targeting higher-end earners, corporations, and things like Wall Street financial transactions, which she mentioned on CNN. A recent financial transaction tax proposal was estimated to raise $2 trillion alone, for example, and CNN has reported Medicare for All would cost $1.4 trillion a year.\" GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER: CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0was there as the former Colorado governor addressed students at Dartmouth College's summer debate program in New Hampshire. Sganga says Hickenlooper was again asked, in light of his campaign shake-up, why he is not running for Senate. \"I don't think they need me to beat Cory Gardner,\" said Hickenlooper. \"And I believe I will do a better job at beating Donald Trump.\" Sganga also said in an odd moment, the governor conceded, \"At 1% in the polls, I can't be too confident at my likelihood to win the nomination.\" UP NORTH:\u00a0Today, a CNN\u00a0poll\u00a0conducted by the University of New Hampshire, shows Biden leading with 24% support of likely Granite State Democratic primary voters, followed by Warren and Sanders, each polling at 19%.\u00a0Sganga says Buttigieg racked up 10% of support, followed by Harris in fifth at 9%. The poll surveyed 386 likely first-in-the-nation voters from July 8 to 15 and has a 5% margin of error.\u00a0 IN THE MIDDLE:\u00a0In a column for the Cedar Rapids Gazette, Iowa State Rep. Liz Bennett announced she is endorsing Senator Elizabeth Warren for president. Bennett is a three-term state representatives from eastern Cedar Rapids. In the column, Bennet wrote she was impressed by Warren's \"intelligence and courage\" and inspired by her \"empathy and the effortless way she lives her values.\" This comes two weeks after retired Iowa Congressman Berkley Bedell announced his endorsement for Warren. Bedell, now 98 years old, cited Warren's \"grit\" and \"determination\" as well as her \"plans to make the changes we need to secure our country and our world for grandchildren\" as the reasons for his support. The campaign tells CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar and Adam Brewster, Bedell will make introductory remarks for Warren before her town hall event tomorrow afternoon in Sioux City, Iowa. Separately, the Des Moines Register analyzed how much candidates spent and raised in Iowa with data showing Sanders spending nearly $150,000 more than the next closest candidate. Sanders spent over $440,000 and during the second quarter he made three trips to Iowa, spanning eight days and 20 events. Rounding out the top five were O'Rourke (over $300,000, four trips, 16 days and 46 events), Delaney (nearly $260,000, four trips, nine days, 30 events), Harris (over $165,000, two trips, four days, six events) and Warren (over $140,000, four trips, nine days, 18 events). Iowa is a place where candidates typically come to spend money, not raise it. Buttigieg had a ton of support here, and held one of the largest events of caucus season back in April when over 1,000 people attended a rally in Des Moines. Some strategists have speculated he missed a big opportunity to crystalize support by not having a big staff in place during his rise; however, when you talk to caucus goers his name comes up frequently as being on their list. Buttigieg had several maxed individual contributions and outraised every other Democratic candidate in Iowa with over $42,000 in contributions from the Hawkeye State. Rounding out the top five were Sanders (nearly $38,000), Biden (over $25,000), Warren (nearly $25,000) and Harris (over $12,000).\u00a0 OUT WEST Biden's team is probably not celebrating two polls released this week in California, showing the former vice president's support there sliding ahead of his visit to the Golden State on Thursday. Both\u00a0Change Research\u00a0and\u00a0Quinnipiac\u00a0have Harris, who hails from the state, surging to a lead in the Super Tuesday contest, with Biden, Warren and Sanders also posting double digits.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says though an overwhelming majority of Democrats have long viewed her favorably, for months Harris had\u00a0trailed\u00a0competitors in the state that also elected her attorney general. But there's at least one silver lining for Biden in Quinnipiac's poll of the liberal bastion: nearly half of the state's Democrats say he has the best chance of beating President Trump, far more than runner-up Sanders (12%).\u00a0 EYEING THE SENATE?\u00a0In an\u00a0interview\u00a0today with a Kansas radio station, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not rule out a run for Senate in Kansas like he has previously, notes\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson. In February, he told the\u00a0\"Today Show\"\u00a0he had \"ruled out\" a Senate run. In the interview today, he said he intends to be secretary as long as Mr. Trump wants him to be, but added, \"I always leave open the possibility that something will change and my path in life will change too.\" Last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters, \"I've said several times, and I'm not sure the president agrees with this that I'd love to see the secretary of state run for Senate in Kansas, but the filing deadline isn't until June, so I think at this early stage in Kansas, I don't really have anything to add. LINDSEY'S LOOT:\u00a0South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham brought in more than $3 million in the second-quarter of 2019 fundraising, surpassing his previous personal fundraising record of $2.05 million during Q1. According to his campaign team, Graham is expected to be the third highest amongst Republican senators in terms of funds on hand. \"For our supporters to step up and give record-breaking amounts in back-to-back quarters shows they truly have Senator Graham's back,\" said campaign manager Scott Farmer in a press release on Monday. \"Senator Graham will boldly continue to work with President Trump to rebuild our military, confirm conservative judges and secure our border\u2026and the people of South Carolina will propel us to victory.\" In a previous edition of\u00a0CBS News 2020 Daily Trail Markers,\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reported that Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison's campaign said its fundraising haul in Q2 was the most ever raised by a Democratic Senate challenger in South Carolina political history. Harrison raised $1.5 million from over 50,000 donors.",

            "article_content": "CBSN's Caitlin Huey-Burns reports: Some Republican lawmakers began criticizing President Trump Monday for his racist attacks on four Democratic congresswomen, calling the comments unacceptable and divisive. A few called on him to apologize, and others implored him to \"stop.\" But Mr. Trump openly dismissed the pleas, and showed no signs of stopping or apologizing. Instead he spent the better part of Monday escalating the situation, telling the congresswomen they were free to leave the United States. \"As far as I'm concerned, if you hate our country, if you're not happy here you can leave,\" he said of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib. \"These are people that in my opinion hate our country ... I am sure there will be many people that won't miss them, but they have to love our country.\"\u00a0 Asked if he was concerned that his demand that the lawmakers, all American citizens, \"go back to where they came from\" was racist, the president told reporters, \"It doesn't concern me because many people agree with me.\" With that remark, Mr. Trump revealed that unlike the Republicans who may see his hits on the congresswomen as a damaging one-off, he believes that attacking them helps him. Read more here. SEN. CORY BOOKER:\u00a0Booker's Iowa senior adviser Joe O'Hern has left the campaign, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar and Adam Brewster. The departure was first confirmed by The Associated Press, which reported O'Hern left for \"personal reasons.\" O'Hern has deep Iowa ties and organizing experience. He served as Martin O'Malley's caucus director in 2016. Booker's campaign is regarded as having one of the strongest presences on the ground, with nearly 50 full time paid staffers including many with Iowa connections. Booker's campaign declined to comment. MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG: The South Bend mayor officially posted the largest second quarter fundraising number after campaigns had to file their second quarter fundraising reports to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) by Monday night. Buttigieg raised nearly $25 million in the second quarter and ended the quarter with over $22.6 million cash on hand. Buttigieg received contributions from several celebrities, including Kevin Bacon, Ellen DeGeneres, George Takei, Barbra Streisand, John Stamos and Jennifer Aniston, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman.\u00a0Buttigieg's FEC report also reveals his campaign spent at least $289,497.56 on private chartered flights. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS:\u00a0While on the campaign trail in Iowa Tuesday, Harris gave her most explicit response to the president's tweets directed at four freshmen congresswomen of color. At a Davenport, Iowa, Women of Color roundtable, Harris said: \"As far as I'm concerned, he's a coward. He's a coward and he's a bully. And he is an embarrassment.\" Harris also said, \"And he needs to go back to where he came from.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0says Harris introduced her\u00a0plan\u00a0to lower prescription drug prices on Tuesday.\u00a0 The plan calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to set \"fair\" drug prices. Harris also says she will use executive action to lower drug prices herself if Congress does not pass the proposal into law within 100 days of Harris taking office. This is at least the fourth policy proposal that uses the powers of the presidency if Congress does not act. Portions of the senator's prescription drug plan are measures that have also been advocated by Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 Harris' campaign also touted several endorsements announced on Tuesday, including that of civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Mr. Crump is known for his work representing the Trayvon Martin family, among other high profile cases. Crump introduced the California senator at an Omega Psi Phi Leadership event in Atlantic City, NJ over the weekend. Crump announced then that Harris tapped him to advise her campaign on criminal justice reform, \"to better serve our community.\" SEN. BERNIE SANDERS:\u00a0Sanders previewed tomorrow's Medicare for All address with a Q&A on Twitch this afternoon.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0notes Sanders said something he is\u00a0considering\u00a0adding to the speech is a lack of media coverage of the cost of health care. He named CBS twice. Sanders argues the U.S. press should be regularly covering the price of healthcare and how it's significantly cheaper in Canada (and elsewhere). He said this is not something you will ever see on CBS, NBC or ABC. PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0The Trump reelection campaign rolled out its Women for Trump coalition. The rollout took place in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lara Trump spoke to the energized crowd who cheered when former press secretary Sarah Sanders and current press secretary Stephanie Grisham were mentioned. A campaign official told\u00a0CBS News political unit AP Ellee Watson\u00a0that there were approximately 1,000 people in attendance. Each speaker claimed that Mr. Trump does not have a problem with female voters, but\u00a0exit poll data\u00a0from the 2018 midterms suggest the party as a whole is struggling with female voters. In 2016, only 51% of white, college-educated women voted for Hillary Clinton, and in 2018, 60% of white, college-educated women voted for Democrats \u2014 an eight point increase for Democrats since Mr. Trump was elected. UP NORTH:\u00a0Booker earned his ninth Granite State endorsement today. Ten-term New Hampshire State Rep. Peter Leishman of Peterborough announced his backing of the New Jersey lawmaker, releasing a personal statement. \"My son, Jordan, suffered from addiction for 12 years, he got caught up in the system, and then we lost him. What we're doing now is not working,\" Leishman said. \"I'm proud to support Cory for president because he thinks of people like my son when he gets up every morning to find solutions to the toughest challenges facing our country. Cory led to passage major, bipartisan legislation that is fixing our criminal justice system, even with Donald Trump in the White House.\"\u00a0 In an\u00a0on-the-road exclusive interview, Booker told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0he won't \"reflexively get rid of private insurance.\" CBS News trailed the New Jersey lawmaker on his RV tour of the Granite State this past weekend.\u00a0 \"When you have unions that have negotiated and bargained for their insurance, I'll tell you quite explicitly, I don't want to give that up. We need to do things in a way that brings people together and advances towards justice,\" Booker said.\u00a0 Following her Granite State tour Sunday, Sen. Kamala Harris earned four New Hampshire backings today: co-chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party Senior Caucus Pam Jorgensen, former state Rep. Lisa DiMartino, and former Dover Mayors William Boc and Jack Buckley. DOWN SOUTH:\u00a0In the aftermath of Mr. Trump's\u00a0racist tweets\u00a0aimed at four Democratic congresswomen of color, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0spoke to nearly two dozen Trump supporters in South Carolina and only three knew of or had read about the controversy. Gibbs Knotts, a political science professor at the College of Charleston, says that this could result from a few different factors but one is that your average voter may not be as tuned in to the president's every move.\u00a0 \"The folks that follow this stuff more closely on Twitter, cable news shows, local and national media are trying to understand what's going on but I think South Carolinians are working on their normal lives \u2014 jobs, soccer practice, things that are happening a daily basis,\" said Knotts. \"They're not following every element of breaking news coming out of Washington or this president's twitter feed.\" OUT WEST: CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says Californians played a big part in Buttigieg's surge of campaign cash last quarter, giving over\u00a0$3.75 million\u00a0to the South Bend mayor. Yet among Californians employed by Silicon Valley behemoths \u2014 like Apple, Google or Facebook \u2014 Harris leads the pack, nearly doubling runner-up Buttigieg in donations\u00a0reported from the campaigns. Though the two are neck-and-neck across the border in Nevada, their sums are dwarfed by the more than $400,000 Biden raised in the Silver State last quarter. A slew of southern Nevada donors helped propel the former vice president's haul, including several gaming executives and the publisher of The Las Vegas Sun maxing out for Biden's primary campaign. ON THE (APPALACHIAN) TRAIL?\u00a0Earlier today,\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0confirmed that Republican Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina governor and congressman, is considering a GOP presidential bid against President Trump. The news of Sanford's possible run sparked a response from the South Carolina state parties, says\u00a0Mitchell, both of which took the opportunity to take jabs at Sanford's infamous extramarital affair during his tenure as governor.\u00a0 \"The last time Mark Sanford had an idea this dumb, it killed his governorship,\" said South Carolina GOP chairman Drew McKissick. \"This makes about as much sense as that trip up the Appalachian trail.\"\u00a0 The South Carolina Democratic Party weighed in as well,\u00a0tweeting: \"We look forward to seeing Mark on the trail! Always nice to see a candidate with fewer extra marital affairs than the president.\"\u00a0 A spokeswoman for Sanford confirmed to CBS News that he is \"actively considering\" a bid but hasn't set a timetable for making a final announcement. The Post & Courier\u00a0reported\u00a0that Sanford says he feels \"convicted\" and that he would run in an effort to push the national debate concerning government spending and the deficit. \"Sometimes in life you've got to say what you've got to say, whether there's an audience or not for that message.\"",

            "article_content": "Bill Hagerty, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, is running for Senate in Tennessee, according to a Friday afternoon tweet by President Trump. Hagerty is running to replace longtime GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander, who is retiring at the end of his term. \"Tennessee loving Bill Hagerty, who was my Tennessee Victoy Chair and is now the very outstanding Ambassador to Japan, will be running for the U.S. Senate. He is strong on crime, borders & our 2nd A. Loves our Military & our Vets. Has my Complete & Total Endorsement!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. Hagerty has not yet formally announced his campaign. The announcement by Mr. Trump comes the day after former Gov. Bill Haslam said he would not run for Senate. Alexander announced that he would not run for re-election at the end of last year. \"The people of Tennessee have been very generous, electing me to serve more combined years as Governor and Senator than anyone else from our state,\" the 78-year-old Alexander said in a statement. \"I am deeply grateful, but now it is time for someone else to have that privilege.\" Alexander was elected to the Senate in 2002 and was a member of the chamber's Republican leadership from 2007 to 2012. He is currently the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and is\u00a0considered a relative moderate within the GOP caucus. He was also consistently popular in Tennessee, winning each of his three elections to the Senate in a landslide. Tennessee saw what was expected to be a relatively competitive Senate race in 2018 between Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn and Democrat Phil Bredesen, also a former governor of the state. However, Blackburn won the race handily, by double digits. Ellee Watson contributed to his report Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Retired Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc announced Monday that he would run for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen, setting up what may be one of the marquee congressional races of 2020.\u00a0 Bolduc, who spent 32 years in the Army, said at his announcement that the current leadership in Washington haven't secured the border, addressed student debt, or ended the opioid crisis. Although Bolduc is running as a Republican, he did not refer to President Trump in his speech. \u00a0 Bolduc told the crowd that he has nothing against Shaheen, who has been in the Senate since 2009, but that \"she has been a part of failed leadership in Washington for too long.\" Bolduc also said that he would not \"engage in personal destruction\" as a candidate.\u00a0 In an interview with CBS News, the two-time purple heart recipient applauded Mr. Trump's decision not to retaliate against Iran after they shot down a U.S. drone. \"Two words,\" the former Brigadier General said. \"Effective leadership.\" Asked if he would support Republican efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade, Bolduc told CBS News, \"I'm pro-life.\" The Republican added that he has only three exceptions to this stance: \"Rape, incest and health of the mother.\"\u00a0 Despite a Republican majority in both the state Senate and state House, New Hampshire repealed its abortion restrictions back in 1997. Current Republican Gov. Chris Sununu describes himself as \"pro-choice\" and supports Roe v. Wade while opposing taxpayer funding of abortion. Bolduc has recruited media consultant Josh McElveen and will be advised by Republican campaign operative Matt Mowers, a former campaign staffer for Trump's 2016 election and State Department senior official.\u00a0 The campaign's announcement video features clips of Bolduc's mission in Afghanistan, where he led a special forces team against the Taliban following the September 11th attacks.\u00a0 Clinton won New Hampshire by less than one percent in 2016, and Republicans are focusing on the state as a potential pickup opportunity for Mr. Trump in 2020 as well as a Senate battleground. Shaheen won her last race against Republican Scott Brown, a former Massachusetts senator and the current Ambassador to New Zealand, by a relatively narrow margin in 2014. More Republican candidates are expected to join the race, including former New Hampshire House Speaker Bill O'Brien. Gov. Chris Sununu, the top pick of many Republicans to face Shaheen, announced in May that he would forgo a Senate run and stay in the governor's office. Bolduc\u00a0recently appeared on CBS News'\u00a0\"60 Minutes\" to talk about his experience with a new therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder called \"stellate ganglion block,\" or SGB. He received the treatment in 2016 when he was the first, and so far only, active duty senior service member to say he suffered from PTSD. He said that SGB worked when all other traditional therapies failed.\u00a0 \u00a0 Bolduc's announcement today was held in front of a memorial he made\u00a0to the 72 soldiers he lost over 10 deployments. He called these men and women part of the \"one percent\" of Americans who serve in the armed forces.\u00a0 New Hampshire Republicans say they're pleased to have Bolduc in the race. The New Hampshire Democratic Party, meanwhile, immediately criticized Bolduc for wanting to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0 According to the left-leaning\u00a0Urban Institute, 89,000 New Hampshire residents would lose access to their health care if ACA was repealed. Bolduc did not address health care in his announcement remarks, but he did tell a local Manchester radio station Monday morning that \"the Affordable Care Act has its strengths and weaknesses, but the bottom line is we need a new healthcare policy in this country.\" On Tuesday, the fledgling candidate will host his first campaign event: a roundtable in downtown Manchester addressing the opioid crisis, featuring local experts and impacted members of the community.

            "article_content": "A massive blackout left tens of millions of people without electricity in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay on Sunday. The Argentine president called it an \"unprecedented\" failure in the countries' interconnected power grid. Authorities were working frantically to restore power, and by the evening, electricity had returned to 98 percent of Argentina, according to state news agency Telam. Power also had been restored to most of Uruguay's 3 million people as well as to people in neighboring Paraguay. Earlier Sunday, Argentine voters were forced to cast ballots by the light of cellphones in gubernatorial elections. Public transportation was halted, shops closed and patients dependent on home medical equipment were urged to go to hospitals with generators. \"This is an unprecedented case that will be investigated thoroughly,\" Argentine President Mauricio Macri said on Twitter.\u00a0 \"I was just on my way to eat with a friend, but we had to cancel everything. There's no subway, nothing is working,\" said Lucas Acosta, a 24-year-old Buenos Aires resident. \"What's worse, today is Father's Day. I've just talked to a neighbor and he told me his sons won't be able to meet him.\" \"This is an extraordinary event that should have never happened,\" Energy Secretary Gustavo Lopetegui told a news conference. \"It's very serious.\" Argentina's power grid is generally known for being in a state of disrepair, with substations and cables that were insufficiently upgraded as power rates remained largely frozen for years. Lopetegui  said the blackout occurred around 7 a.m. local time when a key Argentine interconnection system collapsed. By mid-afternoon nearly half of Argentina's 44 million people were still in the dark. An Argentine independent energy expert said that systemic operational and design errors played a role in the power grid's collapse. \"A localized failure like the one that occurred should be isolated by the same system,\" said Ra\u00fal Bertero, president of the Center for the Study of Energy Regulatory Activity in Argentina. \"The problem is known and technology and studies (exist) to avoid it.\" The Argentine energy company Edesur said on Twitter that the failure originated at an electricity transmission point between the power stations at the country's Yacyret\u00e1 dam and Salto Grande in the country's northeast. Uruguayan energy company UTE said that a failure in the Argentine system cut power to all of Uruguay at one point and much of Argentina. The company said that some Uruguayan coastal cities had service by early afternoon and blamed the collapse on a \"flaw in the Argentine network.\" Argentina's secretary of energy said the power failed at 7:07 a.m. Only the southernmost province of Tierra del Fuego was unaffected. \"The cause is still under investigation,\" the energy secretary's office said. In Paraguay, power in rural communities in the south, near the border with Argentina and Uruguay, was also cut. The country's National Energy Administration said service was restored by afternoon by redirecting energy from the Itaipu hydroelectric plant the country shares with neighboring Brazil. In Argentina, only the southernmost province of Tierra del Fuego was unaffected by the outage because it is not connected to the main power grid. Brazilian and Chilean officials said their countries had not been affected. \"This is the biggest blackout in history, I don't remember anything like this in Uruguay,\" said Valentina Gim\u00e9nez, a resident of the capital, Montevideo. She said her biggest concern was that electricity be restored in time to watch the national team play in the Copa America football tournament Sunday evening. Since taking office, Argentina's President Mauricio Macri has said that gradual austerity measures were needed to revive the country's struggling economy. He has cut red tape, and tried to reduce the government's budget deficit by ordering job cuts and reducing utility subsidies, which he maintained was necessary to recuperate lost revenue due to years-long mismanagement of the electricity sector. According to the Argentine Institute for Social Development, an average family in Argentina still pays 20 times less for electricity than similar households in neighboring countries. The subsidies were a key part of the electricity policy of President N\u00e9stor Kirchner's 2003-2007 administration and the presidency of Kirchner's wife and successor, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez in 2007-2015. Fernandez is now running for vice president in October elections.",

            "article_content": "West Columbia, S.C.\u00a0\u2014 At a private fundraiser in South Carolina on Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden gave President Trump a nickname of his own: \"Clown.\"  On Sunday morning, congregants at the early service at the Brookland Baptist Church here said they're looking for a Democrat who is strong enough to take on Mr. Trump in the general election.  While  the pews were undoubtedly packed with those seeking spiritual fulfillment, two attendees shifted the conversation to politics before the prayers. Biden and Dr. Jill Biden sat in the front row of the large church, which was filled almost entirely by black congregants.  Pamela  Andrews Hutto, a 66-year-old retired English teacher, said her No. 1 issue is beating Mr. Trump. \"Trump  is destroying America,\" Hutto said. \"There is so much hatred now. I see it.\" \"I  see it where people would keep their mouths closed years ago, but they feel free to talk about them because he does,\" she added.\u00a0 Allen  Green, 56, said Biden can \"straighten out\" the president.  \"[Biden]  said he wanted to take him out to the barn and I think [Mr. Trump] might need a nice little barn-settling,\" Green said, referring to the Biden's statement last year that he would have \"beat the hell out\" of the president for his comments about women. Marie  Jackson, 64, said she does not view the president as \"for the people.\" \"I  think he could be a little easier on the people. I don't think the wall needs to be up,\" Jackson said, referring to Mr. Trump's promised border wall. Since announcing his candidacy in late April, Biden's stump speech has regularly included denunciations of Mr. Trump's conduct, particularly the president's reaction to the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. During  Sunday's service, Rev. Charles B. Jackson Sr. recognized a Christian student athlete who is heading to Iowa State on an athletic scholarship and a group of young female entrepreneurs. He then acknowledged the former vice president, and the congregation reacted with excitement \u2014 the women ushers dressed in all white cheered, while several others jumped with delight.  Jackson told Biden, who is Catholic, that while he is not the first candidate to attend services here, he received a \"pretty major\" applause compared to the others. Kendall Corley, the Biden campaign's South Carolina state director, is a member of Brookland Baptist.  There  were a few congregants who told CBS News it is more important for candidates to focus their campaigns on specific policies. Michael  Jackson, 47, said his top concern is affordable universal health care, and he is considering supporting Biden, Sen. Cory Booker or Sen. Kamala Harris. Other congregants, like 73-year-old Wille Wilson, said she hoped the Trump administration's tax  cuts would be repealed \u2014 she said her tax refund this year was $300 less than last year.  This  is Biden's first trip to the Palmetto state since announcing his third bid for the presidency on April 25. He held one rally and a private fundraiser here. After praying and clapping along to the choir music with the congregants, Biden told reporters outside the church that South Carolina is \"critical\" for his campaign.

            "article_content": "Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, says that while he's still seriously \"considering\" challenging President Trump in a GOP presidential primary, he isn't about to \"launch some sort of a suicide mission.\"\u00a0 Hogan told attendees as the traditional \"Politics and Eggs\" breakfast at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire on Tuesday that he needs to see a \"path to victory\" before he mounts a primary challenge. But the governor did say he has been strongly encouraged to run, and that he has \"very strong concerns\" about the future of the Republican party and \"the future of my country.\" \"I happen to believe debate and discussion and talking about the issues is good. Having the ability to have different viewpoints is good. The stifling of debate, the (Republican National Committee) cutting off any discussion is bad,\" said Hogan. The governor, who has been touring the country, also suggested that having some Republican challengers could even help make Mr. Trump a \"stronger candidate.\" \"I think the more the merrier, if you have 20 people on Democratic side and we're going to be hearing about that for the next year and a half...but we have nobody on the other side,\" said Hogan.\u00a0 In recent months, the 62-year-old cancer survivor has repeatedly criticized President Trump, even going so far as to sue the Trump administration over the president's national emergency declaration over border security. While Hogan said he's stood up to the president on a variety of issues, he said his real issue at the moment is political gridlock in Washington.\u00a0 \"We're not getting Congress to do anything, there's no real leadership, we're not brining people together,\" he said. Asked later in New Hampshire about the potential wrath from Mr. Trump coming his way should he decide to run, Hogan replied: \"It probably would not be the most pleasant thing, but I battled cancer for months so I'm not worried about it.\" Hypothesizing about a Hogan presidency, the governor said that whether he runs for president or now, he'll \"try to do something about infrastructure.\" For now, Hogan said his goal is to help build the Republican party into a \"bigger tent that can appeal to more people.\" \"We're doing the opposite right now,\" said Hogan. He said in his opinion, the GOP is \"shrinking the base\" to primarily white males, something he claims is \"not going to win national elections.\" \"Having more voices saying more things -- showing the Republican Party does have diverse thought and were not monolithic -- I think is very healthy for the party and the country.\" Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "The leaders of the remaining 27 countries in the European Union and British Prime Minister Theresa May have agreed to a \"flexible extension\" of Brexit until October 31, EU chairman Donald Tusk said early Thursday. Speaking after five hours of talks at an EU summit in Brussels, Tusk said his \"message to British friends\" was \"please do not waste this time,\" BBC News reports.\u00a0 May said the EU has granted her \"key request\" to add an early exit clause to its agreement to a six-month Brexit extension. May said she wants to leave \"as soon as possible.\"  She said if U.K. lawmakers back her Brexit deal, her country can still leave before June 30 - the Brexit deadline that she had requested from the bloc.  May said Britain faces \"stark\" choices \"and the timetable is clear.\"  Just two days before Britain was due to leave the EU, its leaders spent a long dinner meeting wrangling over whether to save Britain from a precipitous and potentially calamitous Brexit, or to give the foot-dragging departing nation a shove over the edge. May pleaded with them at an emergency summit to delay Britain's exit, due on Friday, for a couple more months while the U.K. sorts out the mess that Brexit has become. Some were sympathetic, but French President Emmanuel Macron struck a warning note. \"Nothing is decided,\" Macron said as he arrived at the summit, insisting on \"clarity\" from May about what Britain wants. \"What's indispensable is that nothing should compromise the European project in the months to come,\" he said. May believes that a June 30 deadline is enough time for Britain's Parliament to ratify a Brexit deal and pass the legislation needed for a smooth Brexit. But British lawmakers have rejected her divorce deal three times, and attempts to forge a compromise with her political opponents have yet to bear fruit. May spoke to the 27 EU leaders for just over an hour, before they met for dinner without her to decide Britain's fate. In contrast to some testy recent summits, there were signs of warmth and even humor. May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were filmed laughing over a tablet bearing an image showing the two of them speaking to their respective Parliaments on Wednesday wearing similar blue jackets. Many leaders said they were inclined to grant a Brexit delay, though Macron had reservations after hearing May speak. An official in the French president's office said the British leader hadn't offered \"sufficient guarantees\" to justify a long extension. Macron is concerned that letting Britain stay too long would distract the EU from other issues - notably next month's European Parliament elections. \"The no-deal situation is a real option,\" said the official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to presidential policy. \"Putting in danger the functioning of Europe is not preferable to a no-deal.\" Others suggested a longer delay would likely be needed, given the depth of Britain's political disarray. May signaled she would accept a longer extension, as long as it contained a get-out-early cause should Britain end its Brexit impasse. \"What is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point at which we ratify the withdrawal agreement,\" May said as she arrived in Brussels. She added that she was hopeful it could be as soon as May 22 \u2014 a key date since that would avoid the need for Britain to participate in elections for the European Parliament. Several months have passed since May and the EU struck a deal laying out the terms of Britain's departure and the outline of future relations. All that was needed was ratification by the British and European Parliaments. But U.K. lawmakers rejected it \u2014  three times. As Britain's departure date of March 29 approached with no resolution in sight, the EU gave Britain until Friday to approve a withdrawal plan, change course and seek a further delay to Brexit, or crash out of the EU with no deal to cushion the shock. If no extension materializes Wednesday, Britain will leave the bloc Friday with no deal, unless it cancels Brexit independently. Economists and business leaders warn that a no-deal Brexit would lead to huge disruptions in trade and travel, with tariffs and customs checks causing gridlock at British ports and possible shortages of goods. A disorderly Brexit would hurt EU nations, as well as Britain, and all want to avoid it. \"I don't anticipate that the U.K. will leave this Friday,\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said. \"I'm very confident that there will be an extension agreed today. What's still open is how long that extension will be and what the conditions will be.\" But the bloc's patience is wearing thin. Several leaders also said they would require assurances of good behavior in return for another delay. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the EU leaders' decision would hinge on \"what her plan is now to get that withdrawal agreement through Parliament, and how we can get guarantees that in the meantime the United Kingdom will stay as a loyal partner.\" The British government insists it won't be obstructive, since it wants to keep close ties to the bloc. But pro-Brexit British politicians have said Britain should be disruptive. Conservative lawmaker Mark Francois said that if the U.K. remained in the bloc, \"then in return we will become a Trojan Horse within the EU.\" May's future is uncertain, whatever the EU decides. She has previously said that \"as prime minister\" she could not agree to let Britain stay in the EU beyond June 30, and she has also promised to step down once Brexit is delivered. Many Conservative Party lawmakers would like her to quit now and let a new leader take charge of the next stage of Brexit. But they can't force her out until the end of the year, after she survived a no-confidence vote in December. Every British initiative to get a deal has floundered so far. Several days of talks between May's Conservative government and the main opposition Labour Party aimed at finding a compromise have failed to produce a breakthrough. Labour favors a softer Brexit than the government has proposed, and wants to retain a close economic relationship with the bloc. The two sides said they would resume their discussions Thursday. Ireland's Varadkar, whose country shares a border with the U.K. and would be among the hardest hit by a no-deal Brexit, said Britain was in \"a difficult position.\" \"It doesn't want to leave without a deal; at the moment it doesn't want to vote for the deal. And of course a lot of people, maybe even half the population, don't want to leave at all,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation Thursday that would admit Puerto Rico into the union as the 51st state without a referendum on the island's territorial status. The bill was unveiled by Florida Rep. Darren Soto, a Democrat who represents parts of Orlando and its large Puerto Rican community, during a press conference in Washington attended by the island's Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, a vocal supporter of Puerto Rican statehood. If enacted, the legislation would automatically trigger the island's admission into the union, bypassing any referendum.\u00a0 \"I'm exited about the possibility of finally ending this historic injustice. It's time for all Puerto Ricans to be united behind a noble and Democratic effort,\" Soto said alongside Rossell\u00f3, local Puerto Rican leaders and Reps. Ruben Gallego, Jamie Raskin, Don Young and Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, the island's non-voting delegate. \"It's time to let the old battle lines fade away. It's time to end 120 years of colonialism.\" In the past seven years, the Puerto Rican government has held two referendums on the status of the island. In both cases, voters chose statehood, but because any change in status requires Congressional approval, the results were symbolic. Boycotted by one of the main political parties and other groups, the last referendum in 2017 was marred by historically low turnout.\u00a0 Although it could secure passage in the Democrat-controlled House, the legislation will almost certainly be opposed by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Senate. President Trump said last year he is an \"absolute no\" on Puerto Rican statehood, as long as critics such as San Juan's mayor remain in office.\u00a0 Democratic backers of the measure said it will allow the party to send a clear message on Puerto Rico during a time when they believe the federal government is mistreating the U.S. territory, which is still recovering from a pair of powerful storms and grappling with decades of financial instability. \u00a0 Since Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017, Congressional Democrats and many elected officials in Puerto Rico, home to approximately 3.2 million U.S. citizens, have accused the Trump administration of treating Puerto Ricans like second-class citizens. The White House's handling of recovery efforts in the aftermath of hurricanes Mar\u00eda and Irma have been sharply criticized by some local residents, leaders and most Democrats in Congress.\u00a0 On Tuesday, several media outlets reported\u00a0Mr. Trump privately told Republican senators he opposed further disaster aid to the island because he believed the U.S. territory received too many federal relief funds compared to states like Texas and Florida, which have also been battered by storms in the past two years. \u00a0\u00a0 Puerto Rican leaders have also denounce the administration for considering\u00a0diverting disaster relief funds\u00a0to finance the president's long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and\u00a0opposing $600 million in food assistance funding, which the White House called \"excessive and unnecessary.\" \u00a0 Because the bill would not include a referendum in which voters can opt for the change in territorial status, if any, that they desire, the legislative effort will likely be met with fierce opposition from some political leaders, citizens and groups, including pro-independence movements and people who want voters to make a decision before any change in territorial status.\u00a0 Asked if it was problematic to cite the results of the 2017 referendum given the low turn out, Rossell\u00f3 told CBS News the bill \"ratifies\" the will of the Puerto Rican people.\u00a0 \"Every time we start approaching a resolution to the status issue, a new excuse comes about,\" he said, touting the victories for the statehood options in the last two plebiscites. \"What we hope to avoid is this never-ending obstacle-imposing path towards equality for the people of Puerto Rico,\" he said, adding that opponents of Puerto Rican statehood should state clearly why they don't want \"equality\" for the island. For decades, the Caribbean island has faced a perpetual struggle over questions of self-determination, which dates back to the late 19th century, when the U.S. acquired the territory after the Spanish-American War.\u00a0 Puerto Rico currently only has a non-voting member serving in the House of Representatives. Statehood would grant Puerto Rico Congressional representation in both the Senate and House as well as a stronger influence in presidential elections.\u00a0 Because they don't have voting representation in Congress, voters living in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are not entitled to electoral votes. Despite having non-voting representation in Congress, voters in the District of Columbia have been able to cast ballots in presidential elections since the 23rd Amendment was ratified in 1961.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Coeburn, Va. - Former coal miner John Robinson's bills for black lung treatments run $4,000 a month. But the federal fund he depends on to help cover them is being drained of money because of inaction by Congress and the Trump administration. Amid the turmoil of the government shutdown this winter, a tax on coal that helps pay for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was cut sharply Jan. 1 and never restored. For coal operators, that's a potential saving of hundreds of millions of dollars a year. With cash trickling into the fund at less than half its usual rate, budget officials estimate that by the middle of 2020 the fund won't have enough money to fully cover its benefit payments. As the surge of black lung disease scars miners' lungs at younger ages than ever, Robinson worries not only about cuts to his benefits, but that younger miners won't get any coverage. \"Coal miners sort of been put on the back burner, thrown to the side,\" Robinson said recently, sitting at his kitchen table in the small Virginia town of Coeburn, near the Kentucky border. \"They just ain't being done right.\" President Donald Trump, who vowed to save the coal industry during the 2016 campaign, has repeatedly praised miners. At an August rally in West Virginia filled with miners in hard hats, he called them \"great people. Brave people. I don't know how the hell you do that. You guys have a lot of courage.\" Mr. Trump made no mention of restoring the 2018 tax rate in his proposed budget released in mid-March. The White House said in a statement Tuesday that \"President Trump and this administration have always supported the mining industry by prioritizing deregulation and less Washington interference.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose home state of Kentucky is third in the nation in coal production, told a reporter from Ohio Valley ReSource in October the tax rate would \"be taken care of before we get into an expiration situation.\" That didn't happen. McConnell spokesman Robert Steurer didn't repeat that pledge this week. Rather, he wrote in an email, \"benefits provided through the Black Lung Disability Fund continue to be provided at regular levels\" and that McConnell \"continues to prioritize maintaining and protecting the benefits.\" The president and McConnell have reaped large contributions from the coal industry, according to the political money website Open Secrets. Mr. Trump received more than $276,000 during the 2016 presidential election from political action committees and individuals affiliated with coal companies.  His inaugural committee received $1 million from Joe Craft, CEO of Alliance Resource Partners in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and $300,000 from the Murray Energy, the nation's largest privately owned coal-mining company. McConnell received more than $297,000 in coal industry donations since 2014, when he was last up for election. Congress established the trust fund in 1978. The money for it came from an excise tax of $1.10 per ton on underground coal and 55 cents on surface-mined coal that brought in $450 million last year. Rates fell to about 50 cents and 25 cents, respectively, when lawmakers failed to act on its Dec. 31 expiration date. The fund provides health benefits and payments to about 25,000 retired miners. Most worked for companies that are now bankrupt. Many, including Robinson, struggle to breathe as their lungs are slowly stifled by tiny dust and particles trapped there. Robinson was 47 when he was diagnosed, part of a wave of younger miners that doctors and experts say have been swept up in a new black lung epidemic in Appalachia. Robinson, now 53, and others who depend on the fund are disappointed in McConnell and other leaders who typically enjoy miners' support. \"I just feel that Mitch McConnell has let the citizens of Kentucky down, especially the miners,\" said Patty Amburgey, whose husband, Crawford, died of black lung disease at age 62 in 2007. She draws a monthly widow's payment through his black lung disability benefits. \"And now there's an epidemic of black lung.\" Dr. Brandon Crum has watched that epidemic unfold at his Pikeville, Kentucky, radiology clinic. In less than four years, Crum has seen 200 miners diagnosed with a severe form of black lung disease, called pulmonary massive fibrosis. The nation had 31 such diagnoses in the 1990s, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. \"We're looking at men in their 30s and 40s on oxygen, being evaluated for lung transplants,\" Crum said. \"Those are usually middle-age individuals with younger families, so it affects their wives, a lot.\" His findings were published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a December 2016 report that showed a shockingly high level of severe black lung cases at his clinic. Amburgey, of Letcher County, Kentucky, said there will be fewer benefits for the growing number of younger miners with black lung if the fund is depleted. Robinson said he's now worried the trust fund's \"pot of money will dry up.\" West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and other coal-state Democratic senators are pushing a bill to shore up the fund by restoring the larger tax for 10 years. Manchin said in a statement that lawmakers \"cannot continue to allow these solutions to be put off again and again.\" That bill is in a Senate finance committee. The mining industry supported the increased tax rate's expiration, calling the effort to maintain it an unnecessary tax increase. The National Mining Association, which speaks for the industry, said the lower rate \"will be sufficient to cover monthly benefit costs for the fund.\" The group argued extending the higher rate would lead to job losses. The May 2018 GAO report contradicts that claim. It said the fund's beneficiaries could multiply \"due to the increased occurrence of black lung disease and its most severe form, progressive massive fibrosis, particularly among Appalachian coal miners.\" The increase in younger black lung sufferers will put more pressure on the fund, as the industry continues to shrink. \"I think people always thought they would get [black lung] if they worked long enough in the mines. But I think it's a disease they thought would affect them at the end of their life, in their 70s or 80s,\" Crum said. Amburgey said President Trump reneged on his pledge to support miners. \"Mr. Trump promised that he would bring the mines back and take care of the miners, and that is not happening,\" she said. \"He promised us a snowball in July.\"",

He announced his 2020 candidacy early Monday with a campaign video\u00a0that hits the highlights of his career as a two-term governor and two-term Denver mayor. He addresses recession, droughts and floods, and the\u00a0mass shooting in Aurora in 2012.\u00a0 Hickenlooper just finished his second term in the statehouse. He was a popular, pro-business governor. He left Colorado with a\u00a0strong economy\u00a0and his tenure was marked by an emphasis on consensus-building.\u00a0 It's that record that he's touting in the campaign video. \"I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington but we also need to get things done,\" Hickenlooper says in the video. \"I've proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver.\" As governor, Hickenlooper also signed an expansion of Medicaid in 2013. He has not expressed support for a single-payer health system. Hickenlooper was the first Denver mayor to be elected Colorado governor in 120 years. And he won election as mayor of Denver with no political experience. He was re-elected in 2014 after running an entirely positive campaign. He was considered one of the nation's most effective mayors -- in 2005, Time named him one of its five top big-city mayors.\u00a0 Hickenlooper was an amiable, business-friendly mayor who was able to lower the city's deficits by cutting costs and by persuading voters to accept sales taxes to pay for a new mass transit system. He also expanded pre-Kindergarten to every 4-year-old. Hickenlooper followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his professional life as a geologist with Buckhorn Petroleum in the 1980s. But the oil bust in the mid-'80s cost him his job in 1986. There were no jobs to be had in the oil industry, so Hickenlooper went into the brewpub business, opening the Wynkoop Brewing Co. The brewery was a success, and it made him a millionaire. Hickenlooper, the second governor or former governor to announce a Democratic presidential bid, follows Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who entered the fray last week. Hickenlooper will kick off his campaign at a hometown event in Denver Thursday. Then it's on to Iowa. In September, Hickenlooper announced the formation of a leadership PAC, the Giddy Up PAC. Last year, he traveled to early-voting primary states like New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina. Hickenlooper has opposed a number of Trump administration policies, including plans to scale back on federal coal emission restrictions, and has been generally critical of the president's approach to business. Over the summer, he called for an investigation into the separation of thousands of children from their families at the border, and he opposed the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.",

            "article_content": "New Delhi -- Indian Air Force jets carried out \"pre-emptive\" strikes on Pakistani territory on Tuesday, stoking tension between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Pakistan called the attack a \"grave aggression\" and promised a \"timely and effective response\" by its own military. India claimed the strikes hit \"the biggest training camp\" of the Islamic extremist group Jaish-e-Muhammad, killing \"a very large number of terrorists,\" in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunwa Province.\u00a0 \u00a0 The airstrikes came 12 days after a suicide car bomb attack by Jaish-e-Muhammad on Indian paramilitary soldiers in India's half of Kashmir. The terror attack left more than 40 soldiers dead and spiked the animosity between two nations which have fought over territorial rights to the Himalayan region of Kashmir for decades.\u00a0 India and Pakistan have fought three major wars since 1947, but there has been no major military confrontation since both nations gained nuclear weapons. \u00a0 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi blamed Pakistan for the February 14 suicide attack in Kashmir -- one of the deadliest in decades -- and promised a \"crushing response\" in its wake. Pressure then mounted quickly on Modi, just days ahead of general elections in which he is seeking a second term, with demands for military action against the neighboring nation. \u00a0 \"I assure you, the country is in safe hands,\" Modi told a crowd of supporters at an election rally on Tuesday. \"I pledge on this soil, I will not let the country die, I will not let the country stop. I will not let the country bend. It is my promise to Mother India; I will protect your honor.\"  Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Keshav Gokhale called the strike a \"non-military pre-emptive action, specifically targeted at the Jaish-e-Muhammad camp.\"  Gokhale may have used the unusual characterization to stress the point that India had not, and did not wish to, target Pakistan's own national military assets.\u00a0 Indian media reports, citing anonymous Indian Air Force sources, said 12 Mirage 2000 fighter jets had dropped 1,000 kilogram (1,600 pound) bombs on the alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in the early hours of Monday morning.\u00a0 India said the strike was predicated by intelligence showing the terror group was planning more suicide attacks in India. \"In the face of imminent danger, a pre-emptive strike became absolutely necessary,\" Gokhale said. He added that the target, located on a hilltop in dense forest, was chosen with a \"desire to avoid civilian casualties.\"  The purported camp was said to be headed up by Maulana Yousuf Azhar, the brother-in-law of Maulana Masood Azhar, the leader of Jaish-e-Muhammad and one of India's most wanted men. He is accused of planning several attacks against India, including a 2001 attack on India's parliament.\u00a0 Pakistani officials confirmed that Indian Air Force jets crossed into the country's territory, but in a series of tweets, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor said the Indian jets had dropped their bombs \"in haste while escaping\" from a \"timely and effective response from Pakistan Air Force.\" Ghafoor claimed the missiles came down in an \"open area\" and caused no material damage or casualties. He tweeted several photos allegedly of the spot where the bombs fell, one of them showing what appeared to be a missile part. The area did appear to be a wooded hilltop, but there was no sign in the photos of any infrastructure or human presence. \u00a0 Payload of hastily escaping Indian aircrafts fell in open. pic.twitter.com/8drYtNGMsm Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi labelled the airstrikes an unwarranted \"grave aggression by India,\" and said Pakistan had a \"right to respond.\" He said Pakistan would respond \"at a time and place of its choosing,\" noting that the country's military forces had been asked to be ready.\u00a0 Qureshi said foreign media were welcome to visit the area where the Indian bombs dropped, and reiterated that they had caused no damage or casualties.\u00a0 Indian media reports said the country's military was put on high alert to meet any response by Pakistan's air force. \u00a0 Monday was not the first time India had carried out a limited military action against purported terrorist targets in Pakistan. In September 2016, in response to an attack on a border military base in Indian Kashmir that killed 19 soldiers, India carried out \"surgical strikes\" on Pakistan 10 days later. Again, Pakistan denied that India had inflicted any damage.",

            "article_content": "Republican Congressman Bradley Byrne of Alabama announced Wednesday that he will challenge U.S. Sen. Doug Jones in 2020 as the GOP tries to reclaim the high-profile seat previously held by Jeff Sessions. Byrne, 64, is the first Republican to announce his candidacy in what is expected to be a crowded primary field seeking to unseat Jones, the first Democrat elected to the seat in a quarter century. \"I want a U.S. senator who will fight for you and me,\" Byrne said in making his announcement before supporters in the south Alabama city of Mobile. He used his speech to express support for a border wall, gun rights and to also voice his opposition to abortion. The primary is to be held March 3, 2020. Jones' campaign issued a statement calling Byrne a \"career politician.\" \"It doesn't matter if Senator Jones has 1 opponent or 100. His focus is working for the people of Alabama whether it's protecting our auto jobs and farmers against dangerous tariffs or building health care infrastructure in Alabama's rural communities,\" the Democrat's campaign statement said. Jones, a former U.S. attorney best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen responsible for Birmingham's infamous 1963 church bombing, is the lone Democrat currently holding statewide office in Alabama. Jones won the 2017 special election to replace Sessions by defeating Republican Roy Moore, who faced multiple sexual misconduct allegations, which he denied. In an interview with The Associated Press, Byrne said Jones doesn't represent \"Alabama's interests and Alabama values.\" He criticized Jones' decision to vote against the confirmation of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and said that \"turned off a lot an awful lot of Alabama citizens.\" \"Are you going to stand with President Trump or are you going to be against President Trump?\" Byrne said. Jones said in September that he was voting no because of concerns about the \"incomplete\" vetting of Kavanaugh's nomination and the \"credible\" testimony of a woman who said Kavanaugh assaulted her when they were teens. Kavanaugh denied the allegations. After Sessions resigned as U.S. attorney general at Trump's request in November, speculation had swirled that he might make a bid for his old Senate seat, but he has taken no public action in that direction so far. Byrne said he has spoken with Sessions, but that Sessions should be the one to disclose his own future political intentions. Byrne was elected to Congress in 2013 from Alabama's 1st Congressional District. He was previously in the Alabama Senate and a chancellor of the Alabama Community College System. An outspoken critic of the then-powerful teachers' lobby, Byrne made an unsuccessful bid for Alabama governor in 2010. He lost the Republican primary after the lobby helped fund attack ads against him during the primary. The 2020 race is expected to bring a crowded GOP field with a number of top state Republicans considering runs. State Senate Pro Tem Del Marsh has said he is considering entering the race. The conservative group Club for Growth Action issued polling ahead of Byrne's announcement contending that Rep. Gary Palmer would be a stronger candidate. Palmer has not announced his intentions.",

They're talking about the baby is born and they can kill this child, this innocent child. What they're doing on abortion, what they're doing on high taxes, what they're doing at the border, what they're doing in so many different ways,\" said Mr. Trump. His comments come after Democratic Virginia Governor Ralph Northam came under fire for controversial comments he made on late-term abortion procedures. Northam was discussing a new bill in the Virginia state legislature that would potentially loosen restrictions on abortions during the third trimester of pregnancy.\u00a0 Mr. Trump went on to claim that Democrats \"want to take our wealth and give it away\" with higher taxes.\u00a0 \"If you look at what they're running on, they can't win,\" the president added.\u00a0 At least 5 Democrats have officially committed to challenging President Trump in the 2020 election and three others who have formed exploratory committees to weigh their options on entering the race.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "Caracas, Venezuela -- Waving flags and chanting \"freedom,\" Venezuelans hit the streets again on Wednesday in a peaceful demonstration against the country's embattled President Nicolas Maduro. His rule, they say, has ruined Venezuela.  CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports the protesters say they've had enough of food shortages, hospitals without drugs, gross corruption and dirty politics -- especially after Maduro's re-election late last year, which they believe was rigged. \"We want free and decent elections, we deserve them,\" said protester Maribel Quevedo.  \"We have fought for 20 years against this (government), we can't take it anymore,\" added Maciel Trejo. The man leading the anti-Maduro fight joined the protesters on the streets of Caracas. Juan Guaid\u00f3, head of Venezuela's congress, the National Assembly, has been recognized as interim president by the United States, along with Canada, the European Union, the Organization of American States and more than a dozen Latin American nations. But Maduro still has the firm backing of his international allies, including Russia and China. Closer to home, Mexico and Cuba are also maintaining relations with his regime. In an op-ed in Thursday's New York Times, Guaid\u00f3 called for more global support to try and pressure Maduro's military commanders into abandoning him. \"The military's withdrawal of support from Mr. Maduro is crucial to enabling a change in government,\" he wrote. The U.S. government is also trying to increase the pressure on Maduro within his own country's borders. Vice President Mike Pence is expected in Miami on Friday to meet members of the Venezuelan exile community, and give robust remarks expressing the Trump administration's backing of Guaid\u00f3. President Trump himself congratulated Guaid\u00f3 in a tweet on Wednesday on what he called his, \"historic assumption of the presidency.\" But Maduro has doubled down. Yesterday state television broadcast pictures of him calling on gathered troops to defend their commander in chief and, for now, the military appears to be standing firm. Maduro also had a warning for the United States, issued in a direct appeal to the American public -- in English -- via a tweet. He claimed the Trump administration, \"intends to turn my Homeland into a 'Vietnam war' in Latin America. Don't allow it!\" The Trump administration has left all options on the table to support Guaid\u00f3 as he tries to solidify his power -- and to defend him from Maduro, if necessary. The White House's new envoy for Venezuela policy, Elliot Abrams, noted on Wednesday that Maduro's \"regime has not acted against him (Guaid\u00f3) in some time and I hope that is because they recognize that he has the support of the vast majority of Venezuelans.\" \u00a0 Europe also appeared to ratchet up its backing for Guaid\u00f3 on Thursday, with the EU calling on all 28 member states to individually recognize him as the legitimate Venezuelan leader. \"All of Venezuela is watching us,\" Member of the European Parliament Esteban Gonzalez Pons, of Spain, said on Thursday. \"Let's make Venezuelan history today by recognizing the democratic and legitimate power of Venezuela.\" Guaid\u00f3 tweeted that he had spoken on the phone with the leader of the EU Parliament and begun \"processes of cooperation between Venezuela and Europe with a view to protecting assets and humanitarian aid.\" He added his own gentle prod to the 28 individual member states, noting that his country was, \"waiting on the countries of Europe.\" Meanwhile, a U.S. C-17 landed in the neighboring country of Colombia on Wednesday, CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reports. Officials insist the flight to the Colombian capital of Bogata was part of a normal mission. Aviation bloggers had noted that two U.S. military planes -- including a giant C-17 Globemaster cargo aircraft -- paid a visit. Colombian media reports, citing U.S. officials, said no American troops got off the jets to stay in Colombia, and the U.S. military has long cooperated closely with Colombia's forces.  Voice of America's Steve Herman called the visit by the C-17 \"unusual,\" and coming just days after Mr. Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton was seen holding a notepad with the words \"5,000 troops to Colombia\" scrawled on it, the four-hour stop by the C-17 has piqued interest in the region. Officials said Wednesday's flight was not the precursor to 5,000 troops, Martin reports. The U.S. has about 200 troops in Colombia along with a security agreement that supports training. Guaid\u00f3 has said his Western-backed, parallel Venezuelan government is in secret talks with elements of the country's military, and he's repeatedly offered amnesty to commanders and troops not guilty of committing crimes against humanity.   The opposition leader addressed the country later at an event in Caracas, claiming security forces showed up at his wife's apartment in an attempt to intimidate him.\u00a0 \"The dictatorship thinks it can intimidate us,\" Guaido said.",

            "article_content": "With guns drawn, FBI agents in combat gear and night-vision equipment fanned out just before dawn Friday in front of the Florida home of President Trump's former campaign adviser, Roger Stone. \"FBI! Open the door!\" one agent commanded as he repeatedly pounded on the door in a video of the raid broadcast on CNN. \"FBI warrant!\" Moments later, a light came on on the second floor. Stone appeared in the doorway in sleepwear with his glasses on.\u00a0 \"Are you Roger Stone?\" an agent asked him. \"Yes,\" he responded. Stone was then led away, charged with seven counts in connection with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. \"When the FBI wants to really make a splash, this is just the way they do it,\" CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman said on CBSN. \"They go in at dawn. They wake someone up when their defenses are most down. They let them get dressed, and they cart them off to the jailhouse.\" Stone's attorney called the morning raid a \"spectacle\" and \"completely unnecessary.\" \u00a0 \"Everyone knows where Roger Stone is,\" Bruce Rogow said. \"He's not in hiding.\" Stone spoke to reporters about the raid after making his\u00a0first appearance\u00a0in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \"This morning at the crack of dawn, 29 FBI agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles with their lights flashing, when they could simply have contacted my attorneys and I would have been more than willing to surrender voluntarily,\" he said. \"They terrorized my wife, my dogs.\" Klieman said the raid on Stone's house was both ethical and proper, given Stone's repeated public vows to never testify against or incriminate Mr. Trump under any circumstances. \"This is fine to be able to do this at the dawn hours, to wake him up and say, 'Hey buddy,' without saying it, 'you're going to jail right now, you're going up to Washington. This is going to cost you a fortune in legal fees and maybe you want to rethink all those statements,'\" Klieman said. \"It is very effective, and that's why they do it.\" Stone remained defiant, however, in the hours following his arrest. \"I will plead not guilty to these charges. I will defeat them in court,\" Stone said. \"As I have said previously, there is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself. I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated.\" Following Stone's arrest, the president suggested that CNN was tipped off about the raid. Mr. Trump tweeted, \"Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! NO COLLUSION! Border Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better. Who alerted CNN to be there?\" CNN\u2019s ability to capture the arrest of Roger Stone was the result of determined reporting and interpreting clues revealed in the course of events. That\u2019s called journalism. #FactsFirst https://t.co/71zu7RylxX CNN responded on Twitter, saying the video resulted from \"determined reporting\" and \"interpreting clues revealed in the course of events.\" Stone posted a $250,000 bond for his release Friday. He said he is scheduled to be arraigned in a Washington, D.C., court next week.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that aired Sunday, November 17, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\"\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face the Nation.\u00a0 We begin this morning with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, we spoke with her just after the conclusion of public impeachment hearings Friday.\u00a0 Our conversation started with President Trump's real time tweet about Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think he was tweeting about her? SPEAKER PELOSI: Well, he made a mistake and he knows her strength. And he was trying to undermine it. Of course, presidents appoint ambassadors, but people don't insult people, especially when they're giving testimony before the Congress of the United States. I think even his most ardent supporters have to honestly admit this is the wrong thing for the president to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House said it was just his opinion. He wasn't trying to intimidate. What do you think? SPEAKER PELOSI: The president and perhaps some at the White House have to know that the words of the president weigh a ton. They are very significant. And he should not frivolously throw out insults, but that's what he does. I think part of it is his own insecurity as an imposter. I think he knows full well that he's in that office way over his head. And so he has to diminish everyone else. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that was witness intimidation in your book? SPEAKER PELOSI: I haven't had a lot of time to pay attention to the president's tweets and the legal implications of them. I just think that was totally wrong and inappropriate and typical of the president. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you tweeted today, you said Ambassador Yovanovitch was viciously smeared by Trump allies, removed from her post and then threatened by the president. What part of that amounts to an impeachable offense or a crime? SPEAKER PELOSI: Well, there are many things that the president does that are completely out of the question that are not impeachable. And they're about the election. But when it comes to violating the Constitution of the United States, as he undermines our national security, jeopardizes the integrity of our elections, dishonors his own oath of office. That's about impeachment. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Constitution defines an impeachable offense as treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors. SPEAKER PELOSI: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think applies to this case? SPEAKER PELOSI: We are unfolding the facts. That's what an inquiry is about. MARGARET BRENNAN: You use the term bribery. SPEAKER PELOSI: Yeah, I was translating from the Latin. That- that was in the context of E Pluribus Unum. For many, one. And so I said for many, one. Quid pro quo. Bribery. Now that's what that is. MARGARET BRENNAN: So but do you expect that to be one of the articles-- SPEAKER PELOSI: I have no idea. Well, there's not even a decision made to impeach the president. This is a finding of fact, unfolding of the truth. And then a decision will be made and that is a decision that goes beyond me. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you point out factually, right, that vote has not taken place to proceed necessarily with impeachment. But do you think you'll go through all of this and not vote to impeach the president? SPEAKER PELOSI: That remains was- the facts if the president has information that demonstrates his innocence in all of this, which we haven't seen. His trans- transcript of a phone call is tucked away in a high- highly sensitive, compartmentalized intelligence server so that we can't see that. If he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it. MARGARET BRENNAN: You think Democrats have had a good week? SPEAKER PELOSI: Well, I think the American people have had a good week. I think truth has had a good week. I think patriotism has had a good week. And I think the Constitution has has a good week. I don't think the president has had a good week. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Republicans argue here-- SPEAKER PELOSI: You know what? If- if we could just talk about what we want to do- I- I really have a real discomfort level of responding to what Republicans say because they are in denial about what has happened in the country. So if you want to ask me about where we're going on this, I'm happy to respond to that. But I find it a waste of my time and yours to just be talking about what Republicans say. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to just let you respond, though, to the argument that's being made in messaging by Republicans here. That the grounds-- SPEAKER PELOSI: No I don't want to respond-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --for the impeachment-- SPEAKER PELOSI: --let it stand. Let their arguments stand because there's so in such quicksand that I don't even want to have it given any more visibility by my dignifying any of their misrepresentations of what they say. And I say that out of great respect for you because I respect you as a great journalist. And I'm honored to have this interview with you. But I say to everybody else, I'm not here to talk about what they say because they're not facing the reality of what is happening to our country. And this is about our democracy that is at risk with this president in the White House. MARGARET BRENNAN: So Chairman Schiff has said he learned of the whistleblower complaint September 9th. The aid was released days later. The military aid that's in question here. Do you see a connection there? SPEAKER PELOSI: Of course. The president wasn't going-- the Republicans like to say, if you want to talk about them, \"oh, it doesn't matter the aid was released.\" No, the whistle was blown. The whistle was blown. And that was blown long before we heard about it. Don't forget that in- in between all of that came, the inspector general, an inspector general appointed by President Trump. And the inspector general said that this was of urgent concern. And so that is what intervened. MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you help walk the American people through what happens next? We have another week of hearings. SPEAKER PELOSI: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: There will be an intelligence report written up and then what? Does the president get, as he says, to confront his accuser or get due process? SPEAKER PELOSI: What do you mean confront his accuser? Confront the whistleblower? MARGARET BRENNAN: Presumably, that's what he means. SPEAKER PELOSI: Well, I will make sure he does not intimidate the whistleblower. So the president could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't expect him to do that? SPEAKER PELOSI: --if he wants to take the oath of office or he could do it in writing. He has every opportunity to present his case. But it's really a sad thing. I mean, what the president did was so much worse than even what Richard Nixon did, that at some point Richard Nixon cared about the country enough to recognize that this could not continue. The Intelligence Committee is leading this part of the inquiry. There are other depositions that are being taken by more committees. So some of the depositions will continue and then what takes place in the intelligence public will continue for another week. I don't know how much longer. I guess it depends on how many more witnesses they have. That's up to the committee. I don't guide that. That's up to the committee. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect that to be wrapped up before the end of the year? SPEAKER PELOSI: I have no idea. Again, I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: No timetable for that? SPEAKER PELOSI: No, I mean, it is self-evident that we have open hearings for the next week. I don't know if there are any beyond that. Then we're out for Thanksgiving. Doesn't mean depositions couldn't be taken during that time. And then when we come back by then, maybe a decision or maybe they have more hearings. And then I have six committees who have been working on all of this, and those six chairmen have been very involved in what the, how we will proceed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean that'll be potentially included in an impeachment that you might broaden this beyond the issue related to Ukraine? SPEAKER PELOSI: Well, that- that it's- not up for me. That's what the facts will determine. We are also proceeding in the courts. And this week we had another powerful decision by a court. Now it is- the president is appealing it to the Supreme Court that the president should release his financial documents. We've won all of the cases in the court on this. Roger Stone, what seven counts, was it that he was found guilty? Manafort is in prison. Michael Cohen, the president's lawyer, is in prison. There's so much wrongdoing attached with all of this. But we have to keep it very precise in terms of the president of the United States and the Constitution of the United States. And that is what this is about. And it's very serious. And none of us came here to impeach a president. This is very sad. At the same time, as I say, we're trying to pass a trade bill, pass our appropriations bills, Voting Rights Act. Whether it's background checks, climate action now, equal pay for equal work, raising the minimum wage, all of the issues that we're working on for the good of the American people. So this isn't- while this is a concentration of our conversation here, it's not what we do in a day. MARGARET BRENNAN: You met with the Treasury secretary this week and he said the White House has no intention of allowing another government shutdown. SPEAKER PELOSI: Agreed. We are- we're all in agreement on that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you confident you can avoid one? SPEAKER PELOSI: Well, let us hope left to their own devices, the appropriators can avoid that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean Democrats will provide funding for the border wall? SPEAKER PELOSI: No, no. That's-we have well over a trillion dollars worth of decisions to make. I don't know why we would go to that. The president hasn't built any new wall in a whole term of office. I think that his comments about the wall are really an applause line at a rally, but they're not anything that he's serious about. MARGARET BRENNAN: When will the free trade deal, known as USMCA be up for a vote? SPEAKER PELOSI: When we have assurances that worker protections are provided. It's all about enforcement. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said imminent recently. SPEAKER PELOSI: Yeah, well imminent that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: does that mean-- SPEAKER PELOSI: Well, we're a long way from where we started. But I'm not, I don't have a date when it'll come up because it cannot be any sooner than the trade representative agrees to the proper enforcement so that our workers really do get a better deal than they have in NAFTA. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is it like for you to go toe to toe with President Trump? SPEAKER PELOSI: Sad, you know. None- as I say, none of us come here to impeach a president. And when a new president is elected, we wish that president success and hope that we can work together and find common ground. And I thought maybe we could on infrastructure. And I'm still hopeful. I thought we could on reducing the cost of prescription drugs. And I'm still hopeful. I had hoped that he would want it to be- able to find some common ground. It is not a president who believes in governance. I've worked with President Bush before and we did many things-- pass the biggest energy bill in the history of the country, PEPFAR for HIV AIDS drugs, issues that related to fairness in terms of the tax code for poor people and- we- we did many things together. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it's different now, though, because you are so often the only woman in this room? I mean that iconic photo of you after that recent clash at the White House with you standing up. SPEAKER PELOSI: Well I was largely the only woman in the room when President Bush was president as well. But President Bush believed in governance so you could find common ground. But if you don't believe that- you know in governance, then there's hardly any way to negotiate a solution. This is a very strange situation. The 24th of September was when I called for a fuller expansion, the inquiry was going on but to proceed with the inquiry, and that kind of changed our communication until that day in the room when I said, \"All roads, Mr. President, with you lead to Putin.\" Whether it's giving them a stronger foothold in the Middle East by what you did with Turkey and Syria. Well, what you did by withholding a grant- withholding aid to military assistance voted by Congress to Ukraine to the benefit of Putin. One-one thousand- more like thirteen thousand by now, Ukrainians have died at the hands of the Russians. They needed that military aid. And with his disparaging remarks about NATO and questioning our commitment to NATO. That's to Putin's advantage. So we do have a, shall we say, a candid relationship. MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Speaker, thank you for your time. SPEAKER PELOSI: My pleasure.",

            "article_content": "So far, this is the question before House lawmakers: Did President Trump commit a high crime or misdemeanor that demands impeachment by pursuing politically charged quid pro quo involving the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a public promise by Ukraine's leader of investigations into Democrats including political rival Joe Biden? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Here are the highlights from the impeachment inquiry this week: The House heard its first televised testimony from three witnesses:\u00a0   Here are the highlights from Kent and Taylor's hearings\u00a0as well as Yovonavitch's.  The new details provided by Taylor spurred closed-door testimony from a new witness Friday: David Holmes, a political officer at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine who, according to Taylor, overheard Mr. Trump ask about the status of \"investigations\" soon after his July call with the Ukrainian president. The House also released more transcripts of closed-door testimony from the following witnesses:\u00a0   Hours after saying he would take the debate to court, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney \u2014 a key witness \u2014 will no longer pursue a lawsuit over whether he should comply with a subpoena to testify. He will instead defer to the president and the Justice Department, which both assert that Trump advisers have \"absolute immunity\" from subpoenas.\u00a0 Mulvaney is the director of the Office of Managment and Budget (OMB), the office involved in the aid delayed to Ukraine, and last month, he appeared to admit, and later deny, that there was a quid pro quo between Mr. Trump and Ukraine's president. Since he became acting chief of staff, Mulvaney's OMB duties have been taken over by Russell Vought.\u00a0 Republicans submitted\u00a0a list of witnesses\u00a0they'd like to hear from in the public hearings. But House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff has already rejected at least two of them: the whistleblower, who has offered to answer Republicans' questions in writing to protect his or her identity, and Hunter Biden, the son of Mr. Trump's political rival who the president claims \u2014 without evidence \u2014 engaged in corruption in Ukraine.\u00a0 If the whistleblower doesn't testify publicly, Republican Lindsey Graham said he \"will not allow trial to go forward\" in the Senate.     Mr. Trump \u2014 who spent the impeachment hearings hosting a\u00a0controversial meeting\u00a0with Turkey's authoritarian president \u2014 said he's \"too busy\" to watch the impeachment hearings and had not been briefed about them. Yet he tweeted about them roughly 30 times on Wednesday and\u00a0denied Taylor's new information.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the White House created a \"rapid response\" team to react to the hearings in real-time with social media posts that undermine the impeachment inquiry and call it a \"hoax.\"\u00a0 On Friday, the White House released the summary of an earlier call between Mr. Trump and Ukraine's president, hoping to exonerate him. But no one had expressed concerns about that call.\u00a0 Democrats, rather than talking about a \"quid pro quo,\" have now started saying that Mr. Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine to investigate 2016 election interference and the Bidens amounts to\u00a0extortion\u00a0or bribery. After the first public hearings, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted that bribery is \"in the Constitution attached to the impeachment proceeding.\" This change in name is likely an attempt to get public opinion on their side. People can only believe in what they understand \u2014 most Americans aren't fluent in Latin, in which quid pro quo means \"this for that.\"     According to a CBS News poll, 73% of people had already made up their minds before the public hearings started \u2014 but they're divided. 43% of Americans believe Mr. Trump deserves to be impeached, while 40% do not. Although more Americans support impeachment overall, slightly more became convinced in the last month that he shouldn't be impeached. His approval rating, meanwhile, has remained unchanged since July.\u00a0 Eight more witnesses are scheduled to publicly testify, including people who were actually on the July 25 call that prompted the initial whistleblower complaint and Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union who CBS News Legal Analyst Kimberly Wehle says is \"the most important witness so far because he actually talked to Trump directly about this stuff.\" Read a breakdown about next week's witnesses here.  Wehle says it's also important to keep in mind that \"there's a laundry list of potential high-level witnesses who haven't been called to testify but should \u2014 particularly if Republicans are serious about wanting firsthand knowledge.\" That includes former National Security Adviser John Bolton, Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani; Mulvaney; Vice President Mike Pence; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry.     \u2014 Stefan Becket, Grace Segers, Kathryn Watson, Emily Tillett, Olivia Gazis, Margaret Brennan, Rebecca Kaplan, Paula Reid and Arden Farhi contributed What is corruption? Who is fighting it? Who is feeding it? Do answers to any or all of these questions \u2013 and the evidence behind those answers \u2013 justify an impeachment inquiry or the impeachment of President Trump? That is the essence of the first two days of public testimony before the House impeachment inquiry. The questions also go to the heart of the institutional question about presidential power: Is this a new normal and, if so, what are the costs/benefits of Mr. Trump's combative and irregular approach to foreign policy? House Democrats said the week's testimony revealed a presidential power run amok, a misuse that, if unchecked, would usher in a new era of presidential lawlessness. This, Democrats said, pointed to the need for impeachment as a remedy. The evidence, they said, goes like this: Mr. Trump improvised new policy in Ukraine, skirted the State Department, emboldened outsiders now under federal indictment or investigation (Lev Parnas and Igor Furman the former, Rudy Giuliani the latter) to smear a stellar diplomat (Yovanovitch) and, lastly, held a vulnerable nation (Ukraine) hostage by dangling military aide in the midst of a hot war with Russia to extract political favors (investigations). Democrats said this amounted to corrupt intent and the traducing of U.S. national security interests (assisting Ukraine against Russia and helping it become less corrupt) for personal gain. Pelosi, aided by internal party focus groups, tried to crystallize the matter by accusing Mr. Trump of \"bribery.\" Bribery, Pelosi, tartly noted, is an impeachable offense. House Republicans did not, in the main, spend much time assailing or seeking to undermine Taylor, Kent or Yovanovitch. Instead, they cried procedural foul over lack of access to the whistleblower, the Democrats refusal to call Hunter Biden as a witness, and continued closed-door depositions. Republicans said Democrats constituted \"some kind of strange cult\" that harbored \"Watergate fantasies\" of ousting a \"duly elected president.\" On substance, Republicans said the Democratic allegations fell apart for these reasons: witnesses to date offered hearsay testimony, Mr. Trump ultimately approved military assistance, Ukraine never launched the investigations Mr. Trump sought, and Mr. Trump has the right to fire any ambassador at any time \u2013 and empower Giuliani & co. to do as they pleased. Kent may have had the best line of the week: \"You can't promote principled anti-corruption action without pissing off corrupt people.\" Who was on which side of that equation? Republicans did not contest that Yovanovitch advanced U.S. anti-corruption aims in Ukraine. They did not contest that Yovanovitch had been smeared by false allegations amplified by Giuliani or that those charges ultimately led to her ouster as ambassador to Ukraine. That the 33-year veteran of the foreign service was undone by her own countrymen acting with Mr. Trump's approval did not appear to trouble Republicans. Ranking Intelligence Committee Republican Devin Nunes said the Yovanovitch saga was a matter for\u00a0human resources. Blared a pushback email from the Republican National Committee: \"Facts don't care about your feelings.\" Those feelings were rattled by Mr. Trump's mid-hearing tweet accusing Yovanovitch of being an inept ambassador \u2013 a tactic Republicans would not defend, other than to say it was no grounds for impeachment. Democrats said the tweet might constitute witness tampering or intimidation and therefore spawn another article of impeachment. Pelosi would not go that far but told \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan: \"He should not frivolously throw out insults, but that's what he does. I think part of it is his own insecurity as an imposter. I think he knows full well that he's in that office way over his head. And so he has to diminish everyone else.\" The White House also released a summary of Mr. Trump's\u00a0first call with Zelensky, an act of \"transparency\" that only sowed more doubts about White House veracity. The summary, which Nunes read into the record at the start of Friday's hearing, does not show Mr. Trump mentioning Ukrainian \"territorial integrity\" or the U.S. desire to \"root out corruption.\" And yet, the official White House statement about what Mr. Trump said to Zelensky said this: \"President Trump underscored the unwavering support of the United States for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity \u2013 within its internationally recognized borders \u2013 and expressed his commitment to work together with President-elect Zelensky and the Ukrainian people to implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity and root out corruption.\" The White House blamed its own National Security Council for the conspicuous gap in what the White House said Mr. Trump said and what he actually said. That ignored the true import of the discrepancy \u2013 Ukraine's new government didn't hear Mr. Trump say what the White House said Mr. Trump said, suggesting vital issues like Ukraine's \"internationally recognized borders\" and efforts to \"root out corruption\" may not have been Trump priorities. More on the discrepancy front, Taylor testified that Sondland took a call from Mr. Trump the day after his July 25 call with Zelensky and that one of his staffers, later identified as David Holmes, clearly overheard Mr. Trump telling Sondland that Biden investigations were a bigger priority than Ukraine's future. Holmes' closed-door deposition late Friday verified Taylor's testimony, adding to the drama of Sondland's appearance before the Intelligence Committee next week. Sondland was a conduit to Giuliani and an active part of Mr. Trump's maneuvers in Ukraine that concerned Taylor and Kent and helped lead to Yovanavitch's undoing. The first week of public hearings was a slow, plodding examination of U.S. foreign policy with allegations of corruption heavy in the air \u2013 long-standing corruption in Ukraine (and U.S. efforts to reduce or blunt it), the possibility of corrupt Trump intentions and GOP accusations of a corrupt Democratic impeachment process. All sides said they were taking principled stands. Next week's hearings will raise the stakes even higher. Get ready for people being pissed off. --Major Garrett",

            "article_content": "Gaza City, Gaza Strip \u2014\u00a0Israeli airstrikes killed more Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza on Wednesday as rocket fire toward Israel resumed after a brief overnight lull. At least 21 Palestinians have been killed in the heaviest round of fighting in months, according to the Gaza health ministry. The military said more than 250 rockets have been fired at Israeli communities since the violence erupted following an Israeli airstrike that killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander accused of being the mastermind of recent attacks.  Israel has stepped up its battle against Iran and its proxies across the region the appointment of new, hardline defense minister Naftali Bennett. After the deadly targeted strike on Tuesday, an Israeli military official said the country had had \"no choice\" but to kill the Islamic Jihad commander. The latest fighting brought life in much of Israel to a standstill. Schools remained closed in Israeli communities near the Gaza border and restrictions on public gatherings continued as rockets rained down. Those attacks came after the early morning strike on Tuesday killed Bahaa Abu el-Atta and his wife as they were sleeping. Rocket fire from Gaza reached as far north as Tel Aviv, and two people were wounded by shrapnel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a special Cabinet meeting that Israel has no interest in sparking a wider confrontation but warned the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad that Israel will keep pounding them until the rockets stop. \"They know we will continue to strike them without mercy,\" Netanyahu said. \"They have one choice: either stop these attacks or absorb more and more blows.\" Gaza's Hamas rulers have yet to enter the fray \u2014 a possible sign the current round of violence could be brief. Although larger and more powerful than Islamic Jihad, Hamas is also more pragmatic. With Gaza's economy in tatters, it appears to have little desire for more fighting with Israel. U.N. Mideast envoy Nickolay Mladenov arrived in Cairo from Tel Aviv on Wednesday in efforts to deescalate the latest Israel-Gaza violence. He was to meet President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, Egyptian officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity under regulations. Egypt, which frequently mediates between Israel and Gaza militants, has been working to de-escalate tensions. The Islamic Jihad rejected the efforts, with spokesman Musab al-Berim saying the group's priority is to \"respond to the crime and confront the Israeli aggression.\" Seeking to keep the outburst under control, the Israeli military has restricted its operations to Islamic Jihad, and nearly all the Gaza casualties so far have been members of the militant group. Israel's new defense minister said Israel wouldn't hesitate to carry out additional targeted killings against those who threaten it. \"Whoever plans to harm us during the day, will never be safe to make it through the night,\" Bennett said after taking office Tuesday. Netanyahu appointed him to fortify his hard-line political base as he clings to office after two inconclusive elections. Bennett has long advocated tougher action against Palestinian militants but wasn't part of the plans to strike Abu el-Atta. No Israeli deaths have been caused by the rockets attacks, mostly thanks to Israel's Iron Dome defense system, which the military said intercepted some 90% of the projectiles. A few homes suffered direct strikes, though, and there was a near miss on a major highway, where a rocket crashed down just after a vehicle had passed. In Gaza, the Islamic Jihad said 38-year-old Khaled Faraj, a brigade commander, was killed early Wednesday along with another militant from the group's Quds radio network. Four others were killed in an airstrike, including a father and two sons, and two others were targeted later. Their identities were unclear. Along with Tuesday's pre-dawn strike in Gaza, another strike attributed to Israel targeted a senior Islamic Jihad commander based in Syria. The strikes appeared to be a new surge in the open warfare between Israel and Iranian proxies in the region. Iran has forces based in Syria, Israel's northern neighbor, and supports Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. In Gaza, it supplies Islamic Jihad with cash, weapons and expertise. Netanyahu has also claimed Iran is using Iraq and far-off Yemen, where Tehran supports Shiite Houthi rebels at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing the government, to plan attacks against Israel. Hamas also receives some support from Iran. Israel frequently strikes Iranian interests in Syria but Tuesday's attack in Damascus appeared to be a rare assassination attempt there of a Palestinian militant. Despite the disruption to daily life, there appeared to be widespread support in Israel for the targeting of Abu el-Atta \u2014 a \"ticking bomb\" who was actively orchestrating new attacks, according to officials. Netanyahu said the military operation was approved by the Cabinet 10 days in advance. \"We showed that we can strike terrorists with minimum damage to innocents,\" Netanyahu said. \"Anyone who harms us, we will harm them.\" Still, some opposition figures suggested the timing could not be divorced from the political reality in Israel, where Netanyahu leads a caretaker government while his chief challenger, former military chief Benny Gantz, is currently trying to build a coalition government of his own. Despite their rivalry, both men support a unity government, but each demands that he lead such a government. Gantz said he'd been briefed on the airstrike in advance, calling it \"the right decision.\" Netanyahu updated his rival on developments later, according to his office. But a successful military operation could bolster Netanyahu as he seeks to hold onto power \u2014 especially if he is indicted on corruption charges. Israel's attorney general is to decide in the coming weeks whether to indict Netanyahu. An indictment would increase pressure on him to step aside. Netanyahu has sought to portray himself as one best capable of steering the country through its many security challenges.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien that aired Sunday, November 10, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now to weigh in on Syria and more is the President's National Security Adviser, Robert O'Brien. Good morning to you, Mr. Ambassador.\u00a0 NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER ROBERT O'BRIEN: Good morning, MARGARET.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard Charlie lay out a very complicated landscape. Diplomacy means talking to your friends and to your enemies and having difficult conversations. But you just heard everything Charlie laid out. I mean, Erdo\u011fan defied the United States by invading Syria. He's buying Russian made weapons. He's doing everything you're telling him not to. Why is he getting rewarded for bad behavior? O'BRIEN: Well, let me just point out, MARGARET, that- that you got it right. And unfortunately Charlie got it wrong. When Charlie said we greenlighted the invasion of Syria- of Syria. That's just absolutely false. It didn't happen.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the U.S. moved troops O'BRIEN: --The President- the president-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --out of the way. O'BRIEN: Well, the president made it very clear that- that Turkey shouldn't go in. He even said, \"if you go in, I may have to obliterate your economy.\" He did it on Twitter. He did it on- on the phone. He did it a letter that was a very strongly worded letter. So the- so the idea that the U.S. somehow greenlighted Turkey's military operation, that's- that's just simply false. And- and the American people shouldn't- shouldn't believe that. Now, what he did do, we had 28 Green Berets who were at a forward operating post on the border that would have been caught in a crossfire between 15,000 Turkish troops and armor and- and seven or eight thousand YPG SDF troops. And the president was not willing\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Kurdish forces\u2014 O'BRIEN: Kurdish forces\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: --that are allies with the U.S. O'BRIEN: Correct. And the president was not going to leave those young men in- in harm's way in a crossfire. And so he pulled those- those troops out because it's\u2014 look, it's ultimately it's the president who has to call the families. It's the president who has to go to Dover\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. O'BRIEN: --if something happens.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's why the question is relevant. Why reward that bad behavior? This is a NATO ally who is putting U.S. troops at risk, who is putting U.S. allies at risk. O'BRIEN: Well, we're not rewarding the behavior. The president promptly put on sanctions, and\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: And then he took them off. O'BRIEN: Well, he did because the Turks agreed to a cease fire. And- and Turkey said they wouldn't agree to a cease fire, the president dispatched me and a number of top diplomats\u2014\u00a0 David Satterfield, Jim Jeffrey and then- then dispatched the Secretary of State and the Vice President to Ankara. And in 24 hours, we had a cease fire. And by the way, that was a cease fire that the Kurdish forces had a lot of input into. We want- we wanted to save lives. We wanted to save Turkish lives. And keep in mind there were Turkish civilians being killed and- and rocketed by the Kurds. There were Kurdish folks being killed, including Turkish soldiers. We got a cease fire. And- and in a short amount of time, we got those Kurdish soldiers evacuated to- to a safe area. So I think the Kurds appreciated the cease fire. I think the Turks did as well. And that was a- a real diplomatic coup from the president because he- because of his tough line.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you recognize that there were war crimes committed?\u00a0 O'BRIEN: Look, it- some of the things that we've seen are very disturbing, and\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: By Turkey-- O'BRIEN: Well\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: and Turkish supported militias? O'BRIEN: Maybe the Turkish supported militias. Turkey has assured us that those are being investigated. We're very concerned about those issues, the war crimes issues. We're watching them. We're monitoring it very closely.\u00a0 There is no place for genocide, for ethnic cleansing, for war crimes in the 21st century. The U.S. won't stand by for it and-\u00a0 and we've made that position very clear to the Turks. MARGARET BRENNAN: If Congress passes any of the at least three sanctions bills on Turkey that are going to get bipartisan support, will the president veto all of them? O'BRIEN: Look, we'll have to see what- what happens this week with our meetings with President Erdo\u011fan. I mean, there are things that, Turkey's a member of NATO. Turkey plays a very important geopolitical role for- for our friends in Europe, for ourselves. They- they sit astride the Bosporus\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. O'BRIEN: --the strait that goes into the Black Sea. We have NATO allies, Romania and Bulgaria that are Black Sea powers. So- so losing Turkey as- as an ally is not something that's good for the Europe- for Europe or for the United States.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk\u2014 O'BRIEN: And- and we're going to-\u00a0 we're going to work on making sure that\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. O'BRIEN: --we can do our very best to keep them as a- as a NATO member. MARGARET BRENNAN: More to talk about your portfolio in a moment. We have to take a break. We'll be right back. (BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation with Ambassador Robert O'Brien, national security adviser to President Trump. I- I want to pick up on this idea where we left it with Turkey coming. And they are a NATO ally, as you emphasized. One of our NATO allies, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said this week that NATO is suffering a brain death because of lack of American support and resolve. From what he's seeing and then what we're seeing with Turkey causing these cracks in the alliance, I mean you must be very concerned. Is that why you've brought the NATO secretary general to the White House this week as well? O'BRIEN: Well, we the NATO summit coming up the third and fourth of December. So, we'll be in London for that summit. I think- I think it's going to be a good summit between NATO allies. NATO's an important alliance to us. But look, I think the cracks of that have formed in the alliance are because we have members of the alliance that aren't paying their fair share, that aren't spending money on defense. I mean, the- the United States taxpayer and- and the taxpayer of eight of the NATO country- taxpayers of eight of the NATO countries that are spending their two percent on national defense. We spend over 4 percent. They're doing the right things. But there are a bunch of countries, including Germany and others, that- that aren't paying their fair share. It's not- it's not right for the American taxpayer to have to defend these countries that don't want to defend themselves. So- so, the president has been very- very strong on this issue. There's been a hundred billion dollars in new NATO defense spending since he took office. It's a great accomplishment of President Trump. I think the Americans are happy about it. I think most Europeans are happy about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Emmanuel Macron was voicing out loud some real concerns. And if you look at what Turkey has done, as you just described, you thought that there was a potential NATO ally would fire on the United States, intentionally or not, in Syria. You've also seen Turkey go ahead and buy Russian made weapons in defiance of NATO.\u00a0 O'BRIEN: Yeah, we're- we're very upset about that. And we've made\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you get behind sanctions on them? O'BRIEN: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, they're supposed to be triggered by Congress. O'BRIEN: Well, look- look, if- if Turkey doesn't get rid of the S-400, I mean, there will likely be sanctions. The CAATSA sanctions will- will pass Congress with an overwhelming bipartisan majority and Turkey will feel the impact of those sanctions. We- we've made that very clear to President Erdo\u011fan. There's no place in NATO for the S-400. There's no place in NATO for significant Russian military purchases. That's a message that the president will deliver to him very clearly when he's here in Washington. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you're just back from Asia. The president says he wants to meet with Xi Jinping and possibly get a trade deal by December. Is that a hard date on the calendar? O'BRIEN: Look, there- there's no deadline. We want to get a good deal. And I think we're very close to getting a phase one trade deal. And it will be the first time that we've had a trade deal where China has actually respected the United States and- and hasn't, you know, stolen intellectual property, has been fair and reciprocal in trade. So, if we can get a good deal, then we'll get a good deal. I think we're very close. And I think if there is a deal, the president and President Xi, will- will get together and sign it. Look, we want great relations with China, but this is the first president that stood up to China that- that has been, you know, stealing American intellectual property. Not all American companies that have access to Chinese markets engage in unfair trade practices. That has to come to an end because the Chinese have been using that to fill- to- to fund one of the most massive military buildups in history.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. O'BRIEN: And- and- and you know, that has to come to a stop. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I just said, you're back from Asia. You've been raising concerns about China's militarization, particularly of the South China Sea. I mean, this only seems to be escalating militarily. O'BRIEN: Well, I don't think it's escalated militarily. I think the president put tariffs on- on China. We've always- and- and those tariffs have- have led the Chinese to the negotiating table. And I think we're going to get a pretty good deal for the American people, especially for the American farmers, for owners of intellectual property. MARGARET BRENNAN: So- so you see a trade deal going ahead and what you're talking about in terms of militarization in the South China Sea, that kind of thing is not going to complicate? O'BRIEN: Look we're- we're going to still stand up and I did at the ASEAN summit at the East Asia Summit. I made it very clear that that just because one country's big and other countries are small in the region, the bigger countries shouldn't bully the smaller countries and- and take their resources, whether they're fishery resources or oil and gas resources. And the U.S. Navy will continue to have freedom of navigation operations through the South China Sea. This nine dash line or cow's tongue that the Chinese have drawn around the entire South China Sea, which is a major swath of the Pacific Ocean, and claimed that as internal waters, as if it was Lake Tahoe or something, that just can't stand. The United States Navy won't put up with it, the countries in the regions- region won't put up with it. And- and all those countries, with very few exceptions, were grateful because- that America's standing up for them, standing up for their resource patrimony. That's the future for their kids and their grandkids with the oil and gas and the fisheries, the minerals off their shores, China shouldn't be allowed to take it just because they're bigger. MARGARET BRENNAN: You on Ukraine. I know you were not at the White House when this July 25th phone call happened. That is now at the heart of this impeachment inquiry. But you are now part of Ukraine policymaking. You heard Senator Graham at the top of the program say the policy is completely incoherent. Will the U.S. continue lethal military aid to Ukraine until Russia backs out of Crimea and stops supporting separatists in Ukraine? O'BRIEN: Well, look, I think you put your finger on the most important issue, and that's lethal military aid. I was in Ukraine in 2014, I was there to observe the elections in Ukraine. I was there as part of a bipartisan election observation mission and I had younger Ukrainian soldiers and young Ukrainians come up to me and say, why won't the U.S., the arsenal of democracy, send us lethal aid? You're sending us blankets and MRE's. Why won't\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 O'BRIEN: --President Obama send us military aid?-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Trump changed-- O'BRIEN: --and there- and there-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --policy by doing that. O'BRIEN: There was no military aid going to the Ukrainians under the- the Obama-Biden administration. When President Trump got into office he sent military aid. So I think what people ought to be focusing on is the president has been helping the- the Ukrainians defend themselves by sending them lethal military aid to stand up to the Russians. That's the real story that's been lost in all this. MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the- is the policy though, that? That that lethal aid will continue until Russia stops backing separatists and trying to annex parts of Ukraine? O'BRIEN: Well, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about what could happen down the road. I mean, hopefully Russia and Ukraine can get along and there can be some sort of a peace treaty and- and an agreement between them. So I'm not going to commit the United States to what we're going to do forever. But- but for right now, we're set. We're the first administration, President Trump is the first president to send lethal military aid to Ukraine. I think that's very important. And I think that's something that's been lost in- in all the hullabaloo about the- about the telephone call. And one other thing I'd say about this, I've been with President Trump in two dozen conversations, either in person or on the phone with foreign leaders. And if the American people could be on those phone calls they'd be extraordinarily proud of the president, how he represents America, the cordiality that he- he has with world leaders, but also the tough message that he has to- to protect U.S. interests. I mean, they'd- they'd be proud of what their president does in those meetings with foreign leaders. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, who has testified under oath, is serving on the National Security Council currently. Will he continue to work for you despite testifying against the president? O'BRIEN: Well- well look, one of the things that I've talked about is that we're streamlining the National Security Council. It got bloated to like two hundred and thirty six people from- up from 100 in the Bush administration under President Obama. We're streamlining the National Security Council. There are people that are detailed from different departments and agencies. My understanding is he's- is that Colonel Vindman is- is detailed from the Department of Defense. So everyone who's detailed at the NSC, people are going to start going back to their own departments and we'll bring in new folks. But we're going to get that number down to around 100 people. That's what it was under Condoleezza Rice. She came and met with me. I met with a number of my successors. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 O'BRIEN:\u00a0 We don't need to recreate the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security over at the White House. We've got great diplomats and soldiers and- and folks that can- that do that work for us in the departments. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to button that up, though. You're saying Colonel-\u00a0 Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is scheduled to rotate out. You are not suggesting in any way that there will be retaliation against him?\u00a0 O'BRIEN: I- I never retaliated against anyone. So the- the- it's\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: But his time is coming to an end? O'BRIEN: There- there will be a point for everybody who's detailed there\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. O'BRIEN: --that their time, that their detail will come to an end. They'll go back to their agency. And what we want them to do is take the experience and skills they learned at the White House, take it back to their departments and agencies and- and do an even better job there. And- and so we're grateful that we can have these detailees come in, and they'll come spend the year- a year or, you know, maybe a little bit more at the White House and then they'll go back to their agency. And they'll do a better job at their agency-- MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. O'BRIEN: -- having been at the White House. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much\u2014 \u00a0 O'BRIEN: Thank you for having me, MARGARET\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 Ambassador O'Brien for joining us. Appreciate it. We'll be right back with our panel. Don't go away.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration recently pulled out 1,000 U.S. troops helping to fight ISIS in northern Syria, leaving our Kurdish partners and allowing Turkey to invade. Many lawmakers, including those in the president's own party, have condemned President Trump's decision to do so. But a recent CBS News poll found that 41% of respondents hadn't heard enough about the situation to approve or disapprove of the decision.\u00a0 On this week's episode of the \"Where Did You Get This Number?\" podcast with Anthony Salvanto, Anthony sits down with CBS News national security correspondent David Martin to discuss the context concerning why U.S. troops were in Syria, and more broadly, how the U.S. military assesses threats around the world. The northern border region of Syria is important to the U.S. because it was the base for the campaign against ISIS, which Martin characterized as defeated but not destroyed. Once Turkey entered the region to fight our Kurdish allies, the campaign against ISIS would collapse. \"There was no need for American troops any longer in Syria, hence the withdrawal order,\" Martin said.\u00a0 The presence of U.S. troops in a region can sometimes be a deterrent to prevent military action, but Martin highlights the irony that Turkey still sent troops into the northern Syrian region despite the 1,000 American troops there. \"Turkey knew that the U.S. wasn't going to fight. They could just basically roll on over us,\" Martin said, in contrast with U.S. troops in Europe. Martin said we were caught between two allies, \"one of which we can afford to throw overboard, namely the Kurds, and one of which we can't afford to throw overboard, namely the Turks.\" In terms of threats and priorities, Martin said the top priority for each of the past 3 Secretaries of Defense has been China, which requires a military presence in the Pacific.\u00a0 \"But if you have to send 2,000 troops to Syria, 14,000 troops to Afghanistan, 5,000 troops to Iraq, and on and on, it gets harder and harder to sustain a military presence in the Pacific,\" Martin said. \"So the Pentagon is all for getting out of these wars as quickly as possible. They just don't want to pull out and then have a resurgence of the terrorists.\" Martin cited the Obama administration's 2011 decision to pull U.S. combat troops out of Iraq, against the advice of military and intelligence officers, which is now regarded as contributing to the rise of ISIS.\u00a0 Subscribe to\u00a0\"Where Did You Get This Number?\"\u00a0and download the latest episode to learn more about the fight against ISIS, the track record of ceasefires in Syria, global threats to the U.S., what it's like covering the Pentagon, and more.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Mike Morell and William Burns that aired Sunday, October 20, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're now joined by former acting director of the CIA and CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morrell, as well  as career diplomat former Ambassador William Burns who also recently authored a book called The Backchannel. Thanks so much to both of you for being here. AMBASSADOR WILLIAM BURNS: Great to be with you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on the immediate crisis around Syria. Mike, you know the general who clearly knows what's happening on the ground. He was pretty polite in what  he said but his frustration in terms of the promises made to the Kurds was clear.\u00a0 MIKE MORRELL: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: How much of a loss to U.S. intelligence is it to have this pullout from northern Syria?\u00a0 MIKE MORRELL: So the Kurds were during a number of things for us. They were actually fighting ISIS for us in a very significant way and that is now lost. They were also collecting  intelligence for us and giving that to us so that we could use it in our fight against ISIS and on the other side of the border in what the Iraqis were doing and I don't know that we've lost that but I bet you either have or it is at significant risk. MARGARET BRENNAN: And who benefits from that besides ISIS?\u00a0 MIKE MORRELL: ISIS benefits. The Russians benefit because they're going to be the ones getting that intelligence now. The Syrian- the Syrian regime is going to benefit. But the-  the biggest- the biggest winner here is ISIS. MARGARET BRENNAN: Bill, I mean, you've- you've negotiated with Erdo\u011fan, with a number of these regional players. You know, typically it- it- it's a rule that military presence  gives diplomatic leverage when you're in a negotiation. When Vice President Pence went to Turkey this week, he promised to lift U.S. sanctions. He seemed to promise that the U.S. allies would withdraw from this area, as well. Was this a negotiation or was  this, as some say, a surrender? AMB. BURNS: Yeah, I mean, I think there was a smart way and a dumb way to deal with what was a very complicated situation in which we had modest leverage in northeast Syria. I  think we chose the dumb way. In one impulsive presidential phone call, we in a sense gave away our leverage. And then in a pretty hasty negotiated cease fire, we threw the Kurds under the bus and essentially gave Erdogan everything he wanted. And so while  the president has called this a \"great deal,\" if this is a \"great deal,\" I'd hate to see what a bad one is because the winners, as Mike suggested, are not only the Turks and the Russians but also the Assad regime and the Iranians and I'm afraid ultimately  ISIS which is going to try to revive itself out of the chaos and the insecurity and the grievance on which it thrives. MARGARET BRENNAN: But is this hyperbolic in some ways? I mean, that American influence has diminished because of this one single decision. MIKE MORRELL: I don't think so at all. So you have all of what Bill said in terms of what happens in the Middle East but there's also the broader message that this sends to the  entire world, right? And there's two things. One is that might makes right, right? That you can accomplish with violence differences between countries and that's not something that is in American interest, right, to have that view in the world. The other is  that the American word, right, the American guarantees that we provide to people aren't worth anything, right? That at the end of the day is going to strengthen people like China and people like Russia who are going to come in behind us and make promises that  they can't keep. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's always interesting to hear General Thomas say there was an understanding that America had given its word there. Bill, I want to switch to another topic because  you know, personally, many of the diplomats who have gone up to Capitol Hill and behind closed doors given testimony about what has happened with Ukraine. You were scathing in an op-ed that you wrote. In terms of Secretary Pompeo, you said was derelict in  his duty, not protecting his diplomats. He took a shot at you this morning and said you're just auditioning for a role in the next administration as Elizabeth Warren's Secretary of State. Is that what you're doing? AMB. BURNS: No. You know, my- my concerns- the concerns I expressed in that article are not about politics. You know like Michael, I spent three and a half decades proudly serving  secret- presidents of both parties. My concerns are about the hollowing out of American diplomacy, whether you measure that in tangible ways, the sidelining of career expertise, not standing up for your people when they're unfairly accused, but also intangible  ways. You know when President Trump was asked a little more than a year ago whether he was concerned about a record number of senior vacancies in the State Department, he said, \"no not really because I'm the only one who matters.\" That's diplomacy as an exercise  in narcissism, not the diplomacy I learned as a young diplomat many years ago working for presidents like George H.W. Bush and secretaries of state like Jim Baker. MARGARET BRENNAN: But for people on the outside when they hear the president say well this is just deep state bureaucrats being frustrated they're being sidelined. What is important  about having done this professionally? AMB. BURNS: What- what's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean what- what is it that is lost when you have one of the president's friends intervene as you had Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland, who is a political appointee,  a financial donor. Many presidents appoint financial donors to ambassadorships. AMB. BURNS: No, that's true, but I think what we're seeing right now is career public servants, like Ambassador Yovanovitch, who are fulfilling their obligation to tell the truth  when they're asked by Congress and they're doing it honorably and they're doing it with their heads held high. That's a pretty sharp contrast to the behavior of the president and people around him who are doing a pretty good job of concealing their own sense  of decency right now. MORRELL: And just to- just to add MARGARET, expertise, knowledge, experience are extraordinarily important to making the right decisions in government and that's what's being lost  by not relying on these people. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, the intelligence community has been accused by this president of having its own deep state of just- he was disrupting and they didn't like it and they  pushed back, is the president's narrative around this. The attorney general who launched this investigation into the origins of the Russia probe, which concluded definitively that it was Russia that meddled in the 2016 election, seems to be expanding this  probe. MORRELL: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: What is the impact of this on the intelligence community? MORRELL: So, I think that- that Durham investigation at Barr's behest into the intelligence community's work on the link between the Trump campaign and the Russians is okay in  one respect and not okay in the other. The respect that it's okay is taking a look at what the intelligence community did and answering the question: was it done by the book from a legal perspective? Was it consistent with statute? That's okay to me. What's  not okay is to put the analysts under a spotlight and say, \"did they get the analysis right?\" Why is that not okay for me? It's a- it's not okay for two reasons. One is that the Justice Department has no experience, no knowledge of, no particular perspective  to bring to bear on analysis and they're likely to get the answer wrong because their standards of making a judgment are very, very, very different from the intelligence community standards. And I think there is going to be an effect on analysts who now have  to go out and hire lawyers before they sit down with a Department of Justice prosecutor. There's gonna be an effect on analysts in terms of them saying, \"do I really want to make the hard call in the future?\"\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you- John Brennan, former head of the CIA, and Jim Clapper, former Director National Intelligence, have- CBS has confirmed that they've been approached for-- MORRELL: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --to answer these questions. MORRELL: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you saying this is all political and not legitimate? MORRELL: So- so there are questions, right? There are questions out there about whether the intelligence community and the FBI did the right thing, right? From a legal perspective,  I think it's OK to look at that and put that issue to rest. I don't like looking at analysis because that's a completely different issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Last word here. Ambassador, Mike brought up all these people having to go out and hire lawyers and sort of defend their positions. Do you see this as a  long term hit to the national security architecture of this country? AMB. BURNS: It is. I mean I think it's- it's really taking a toll on career public servants and on expertise, as Michael said, at precisely the moment when the United States needs  to rely on that expertise whether it's in the intelligence community, the State Department, the Defense Department more than the other time because we're on a very competitive international landscape and we're digging a very deep hole for ourselves right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks very much to both of you for lending us your expertise. We'll be right back with our political panel.",

            "article_content": "Editor's Note: Representative Elijah Cummings, longtime civil rights activist from Baltimore, died early Thursday at the age of 68, his office said. The House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman, a Democrat and 23-year House veteran, was a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a recent target of intense criticism from the president. In January, Steve Kroft talked to Cummings about his life and the power he held as chairman of his committee. Below is a transcript of that story On Thursday, we learned President Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who is headed for prison, will testify in a televised hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. It marked the beginning of season three of what's been called the \"Donald Trump Reality Show\" with a fresh plot, and new characters ushered in by voters in the midterm election who gave Democrats control of the House of Representatives. Among the recently empowered is Congressman Elijah Cummings, the new chairman of the House oversight committee. It has the constitutional authority to investigate anything it wants, creating serious problems for the Trump administration and making Cummings one of the most powerful people in Washington. Elijah Cummings has been a familiar face on Capitol Hill for a long time, a respected 13-term Maryland congressman who has served on the oversight and reform committee under four different presidents. And he was handpicked by the Democratic leaders for this job.  Rep. Elijah Cummings: We are in a fight for the soul of our democracy. And you've got to understand that. This is serious business. You can dismiss the congressman's statement as partisan hyperbole, but part of the government is shuttered, four of President Trump's former associates are now convicted felons, ten of his original cabinet secretaries have left, four under a cloud of scandal. And there are 17 other investigations underway. Not counting the ones that are about to begin in the new Democratic House of Representatives empowered with the legal authority to compel testimony and demand documents. Steve Kroft: So how are you gonna run this committee? Rep. Elijah Cummings: What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to work with the Republicans as I have in the past. You know why? Because that's our job. And when it comes to subpoena, I know the power of a subpoena, having practiced laws. In order to do oversight, you gotta have documents. You gotta have emails. You gotta have information.  For the first two years of the Trump administration that kind of information was beyond the reach of house Democrats. The power of subpoena belonged exclusively to the Republican majority. As ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, Cummings made 64 requests for subpoenas on things like White House security clearances, hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico, and the Justice Department's refusal to defend the Affordable Care Act. All of them were blocked by the Republican chairman. Steve Kroft: You've asked the White House for a bunch of things. \u00a0you've asked for documents connected to Jared Kushner's use of private emails. Child separation policy at the border. Have you ever gotten anything?  Rep. Elijah Cummings: Zero. Steve Kroft: Nothing? Rep. Elijah Cummings: Zero. --that's the point. Now, I-- I don't know if any president has ever done this. None. None that has ever said, \"I'm not givin' you anything.\" For anything. Nothing. Steve Kroft: But you're sitting here telling me you think somehow, miraculously, he's going to change. Rep. Elijah Cummings: it's not about miraculous. It's about-- adherence to the Constitution. And the American people and the Congress is insisting that he allows us to do our job. Basically what the president has done and the Republicans have done, they've joined hands. And the Republicans have been basically not only blocking but become the defense counsel for the president. Okay. But no documents? I mean, come on. Now as chairman of the oversight committee, Cummings no longer has to consult with the Republicans to issue subpoenas, initiate investigations or call hearings, and he has a much bigger budget and staff. So will Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, and Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee, but their inquiries will be limited to their specific jurisdictions. Cummings' committee has the authority to investigate anything inside or outside the federal government. Rep. Elijah Cummings: We can look at anything. Steve Kroft: You could-- Rep. Elijah Cummings: Anything. Steve Kroft: --look at Interior, you could look at E.P.A. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Anything. but the fact that we can look at anything is part of the problem. There's so much. No, I'm-- I'm serious. There's so much. Steve Kroft: And you only have two years. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Less than that. Actually, less than that. The Congress doesn't meet but so many days in a year. \u00a0And all I'm saying is that we've gotta hit the ground, not running, but flying.  Some Democrats believe Cummings should go for the jugular and push for impeachment. He says it's premature, and he also wants to pursue other issues especially the high cost of prescription drugs. His staff has already sent out 51 letters to government officials, the White House, and the Trump Organization asking for documents related to investigations that the committee may launch. The issues range from the private use of government owned aircraft by cabinet members to the flow of foreign money into various Trump enterprises like his hotel in Washington. Steve Kroft: You think he's making money off this job? Rep. Elijah Cummings: Please.  Steve Kroft: A lotta money? Rep. Elijah Cummings: A lotta money.  Steve Kroft: And-- and you say the Constitution and the laws say it's not okay? Rep. Elijah Cummings: It's not okay. And, but this is the other piece. I still believe that people-- the average citizen, the guys on my block, they oughta know if the president is making a deal, whether he's making it-- making it in his self-interest or that of the country. In response, the White House said: \"these claims are completely baseless, but we cannot comment further about ongoing litigation.\" Elijah Cummings has been in Congress for 23 years but he is not a creature of Washington. When he needs to be there he commutes from his Maryland district, an hour's drive to the north, where he represents 700,000 people and most of the city of Baltimore. He was born here 67 years ago to parents with fourth grade educations who'd been sharecroppers in South Carolina before moving north for a better life. His father worked in a chemical plant, his mother was a domestic. Both were pentecostal ministers. Rep. Elijah Cummings: First it was religion, and then it was the education. My father, Steve, had a saying. He said-- he told us, \"If you miss one day of school, that meant you died the night before.\" And he meant that. I did not miss one second of school between kindergarten and graduating from high school. Not one second. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Howard University before earning a law degree at Maryland. He says he is one of the few congressmen who live in an inner-city, working-class neighborhood.  Steve Kroft: How long have you lived here? Rep. Elijah Cummings: 37 years.  He says he keeps a campaign poster in the front window so people will know where to find him. Steve Kroft: \u00a0So you like to be among your constituents? Rep. Elijah Cummings: I like to be among my constituents. Let me tell you something man, if I don't do well in this block I'm in trouble. \u00a0I mean, if you wanna take a poll, if I lost in this block I might as well go-- I might as well stay home. When riots broke out in Baltimore three years ago after the death of a young black man, Freddie Gray, who was fatally injured in the back of a police van, Cummings gained national attention walking the troubled neighborhoods trying to keep the peace. He is part of the city's fabric.  But now he has stepped onto a much larger stage, under the bright lights of the oversight committee. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Well, I sit here. And the Democrats'll be all over here. And the Republicans will be over there. Our hearings can go anywhere from an hour and a half to 11 or 12 hours. Steve Kroft: So you got a good, comfortable chair. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Got a good, comfortable chair. And \u00a0I gotta tell you, Steve-- standing here, it just-- it sorta gives me chills in a way because I think about my journey to this chair. After years as the committee's ranking minority member, he is ready to wield the gavel and the subpoena. Steve Kroft: You've got a lotta power. But you don't have unlimited power. I mean-- Rep. Elijah Cummings: No. Steve Kroft: --and the Republicans are going to put a lot of obstacles in your way. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Sure. I expect that. \u00a0Now, there's one big elephant that's sittin' around here that we don't know-- what it's gonna yield. And that is Mueller's report. I don't know what that report is gonna have in it. One thing I do know, though, is whatever it is, even if it-- if it exonerates the president, fine. But this I do know: I want whatever it is, for the Congress to have it, and I want the public to have it, so that everybody can make a judgment.  Steve Kroft: Do you think it's possible the Republicans will try and suppress the report? Rep. Elijah Cummings: I hope not. But that's a possibility. But I hope not. I hope they don't.  Cummings' Republican foil on the committee is Ohio's Jim Jordan, one of the president's most loyal and enthusiastic supporters. Steve Kroft: You've known Elijah Cummings for a while. How would you describe your relationship? Rep. Jim Jordan: Well, look, there's-- there's not much of anything that-- that Mr. Cummings and I agree on, policy-wise. But-- I certainly respect his toughness-- his tenacity. You know, he's demonstrated that he's-- he's a fighter and I kinda-- my background is such that I kind of appreciate that. A founding member of the Freedom Caucus, Congressman Jordan is a one-time college wrestler and coach, still known for his scrappiness. He's seldom seen wearing a jacket, and always ready to go to the mat.  Rep. Jim Jordan: Taxes have been cut, regulations reduced, the economy growing at an unbelievable rate, lowest unemployment in 50 years. 312,000 jobs added last month alone. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on the courts. We're out of the Iran deal. The embassy's in Jerusalem. Hostages are home from North Korea. And oh, by the way, there's a new N.A.F.T.A. agreement. So it's an amazing record and that's what I know about the two years that we've had Donald Trump as President of the United States.  Steve Kroft: After the midterms, you wrote a letter to the Republicans saying, \"You must valiantly defend the president.\" Is that your job? Rep. Jim Jordan: My job is getting to the truth. \u00a0If the president is getting a raw deal I'm going to defend him.  Steve Kroft: I feel like I would be remiss in this if I didn't point out that truthfulness has not exactly been President Trump's strongest asset. Rep. Jim Jordan: Well, I mean, Steve, look, this-- this president's probably been attacked more than any president that-- in my lifetime. And here's what I know. Over the last two years, in spite of the unprecedented attacks that have come against President Trump, the last two years have been amazing.  Chairman Cummings wouldn't disagree that the past two years have been amazing, but in a much different way.  Rep. Elijah Cummings: I don't think the other presidents-- called a lie the truth and the truth a lie. I-- I'm gonna tell you, that's what makes the relationship so difficult. It's hard to trust. You-- you wanna believe that if you make an agreement with someone, and I believed that with the other presidents it was this way, their word was their bond. \u00a0I don't know how to compare. I-- I-- I don't. And I'm not tryin' to be smart. Steve Kroft: We're in new territory here. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Yes, it's new territory.  The new territory now includes a beefed-up White House counsel's office. \u00a0It has added more than a dozen new lawyers to fight what it anticipates will be a barrage of requests and subpoenas from congress. Steve Kroft: What happens if you issue a bunch of subpoenas and the administration doesn't respond? Or invokes executive privilege.  Rep. Elijah Cummings: We probably will end up in the courts.

            "article_content": "Rioting raged in Barcelona and throughout the Catalan region for a third straight night Wednesday, as police fought street battles with protesters who are angered by lengthy prison sentences for nine leaders of the wealthy region's drive for independence from Spain. The president of the Catalan region, Quim Torra, called for a halt in the violence, BBC News reports.\u00a0 \"We condemn violence,\" Quim Torra said. \"There is no reason nor justification for burning cars, nor any other vandalism.\" Torra, who advocates independence for Catalonia, was speaking after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez made a direct appeal to him to condemn the violence, according to BBC News.\u00a0 In Barcelona, tens of thousands of protesters faced off against police. Some set up flaming barricades in the streets, torching cars and trash cans. They chanted, \"The streets will always be ours!\" Catalan police said protesters threw gasoline bombs, stones, bottles and firecrackers at them. The violence erupted in Catalonia after Spain's Supreme Court on Monday sentenced nine separatist Catalan leaders to up to 13 years in prison for their part in an October 2017 effort to declare independence for the region. After a surge in separatist sentiment since the global economic crisis hit Spain, around half of Catalonia's 7.5 million residents want to break away from Spain and forge a new European country. The issue has divided families and friends, but demonstrations had largely been peaceful until this week. Outnumbered police used riot helmets, vests and shields for protection. They fired foam bullets and swung batons to keep away the swarming radicals, most of whom covered their faces. Police also drove armored vans at high speeds to scatter the crowds \u2014 but when police succeeded in dispersing one hot spot, another erupted. One police helicopter was hit by five \"pyrotechnic\" objects similar to fireworks, according to the regional police force. The rare passers-by or tourists caught in the middle of the melees scurried to safety. Some residents tossed water from balconies down on burning trash bins and debris while firefighters tried to keep up with the emergencies. Central Barcelona, a leading tourist destination known for its beautiful architecture and relaxed atmosphere, became a no-go territory. \u2033(This is) shameful. It doesn't represent me,\" architect Gerard Beltri said. \"I think the verdict was very bad, but I think this (violence) is by a minority of the independence movement. The real independence movement is not like this. These people only want to do damage and that's it.\" Health services in Catalonia said medics attended to 52 people in the region Wednesday. Police said late Wednesday that they had arrested \"at least 20 people\" throughout Catalonia for violent acts. S\u00e1nchez said the violent clashes wouldn't provoke him into taking drastic measures in Catalonia, despite calls by rival parties to crack down on the separatist politicians in power in the region. S\u00e1nchez, who is an interim prime minister while awaiting national elections on Nov. 10, consulted with other national political leaders in Madrid during the day about the trouble in Catalonia. The Spanish government will respond with \"firmness, calmness and unity\" to the confrontations, S\u00e1nchez said in a televised address. S\u00e1nchez blamed \"organized groups of extremists\" for the rioting, but said he wouldn't be drawn into playing their game of an \"ascending spiral of violence.\" The protests followed the pattern of previous days as crowds gathered during the day to block roads and hold marches demanding independence. After sunset, marches turned ugly. Police also reported clashes in Girona, a town near the French border, and other places. The clashes have injured more than 250 people, including police, over the past three days. On Monday police skirmished for hours to keep protesters from entering the Barcelona airport and shutting it down. An organization representing Barcelona businesses, called Barcelona Abierta, said the violence had caused \"significant losses\" and \"deeply damaged\" its image abroad. Pere Ferrer, director of Catalonia's regional police, said the street violence was \"intolerable.\" Other protests are scheduled in the coming days as separatists vow no letup in their secession drive. Most impromptu protesters have responded to an online campaign by Tsunami Democratic, a shadowy grassroots group that uses encrypted messaging apps to call for peaceful disobedience. Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Cadena SER radio that authorities were investigating the group and \"close to\" discovering who is behind it. On Wednesday, the group issued a statement appealing for an end to the violence. During a daytime lull in the rioting, thousands of people set off Wednesday on five large peaceful protest marches across Catalonia that aim to converge in Barcelona on Friday. They included families with children, elderly and young people, carrying banners reading \"Libertat Presos Politics\" (Freedom for political prisoners) \u2014 a reference to the leaders sentenced by the Supreme Court. Torra, a fervent separatist who critics have called a xenophobe, joined one of the marches, saying he wanted to be next to the people. After three days of ignoring calls to criticize the street violence in the region he governs, Torra bent to the pressure late Wednesday and called for the unrest to stop. \"I make a call for calm and serenity. We separatists have not been and are not violent,\" he said in a brief and hurriedly organized televised statement. \"This must stop right now.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump on Monday said he doesn't think keeping a limited number of U.S. troops in Syria will be necessary, other than leaving a few troops to secure oil, as he faces backlash for the way he ordered the withdrawal of troops from northern Syria. Mr. Trump, making the comments in a Cabinet meeting with top White House officials and department secretaries, said troops who have been in Syria will be sent elsewhere before eventually heading home.\u00a0 The president also insisted \"you have to look at both ways\" in the conflict between the Turks and Kurdish allies, because \"plenty of Turks have been killed because of conflict on their borders.\" Mr. Trump reiterated his line that the Kurds, who lost thousands of lives in the fight alongside the U.S. against ISIS, are \"not angels.\" \"We never agreed to protect the Kurds for their rest of their life,\" Mr. Trump said in the Cabinet meeting.\u00a0 The president insisted the ceasefire the U.S. says it struck with Turkey is holding, though Turkey maintains it did not agree to a ceasefire. The commander-in-chief took credit for capturing ISIS, claiming he knows more than pundits or anyone else on the topic.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said he was taking troops out of northern Syria to diminish the United States' presence in the Middle East, but meanwhile, the U.S. is sending thousands of troops to Saudi Arabia. Criticism of the president over Syria comes at a time when he most needs Republican allies as Democrats' impeachment inquiry moves swiftly forward. A number of top administration officials have been called on to testify on Capitol Hill.\u00a0 Over the weekend, the president reversed his decision to hold next year's G-7 summit\u00a0at his club near Miami, after acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney held a press conference for the express purpose of announcing and defending the summit. In that same press conference, Mulvaney said the administration had withheld Ukraine aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate alleged events surrounding the 2016 election. Mulvaney then reversed parts of his press conference in a subsequent statement and in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Mr. Trump claimed the G-7 summit at his club would have been better than any other G-7 summit. He also insisted he didn't need the money or the promotion from the summit, telling reporters, \"I think I get more promotion than any human being that's ever lived.\" The president also lamented the protection of the whistleblower who made a complaint that launched Democrats' impeachment inquiry, claiming against evidence that the whistleblower's complaint was inaccurate. Mr. Trump did not respond to a reporter's question about whether Mulvaney would stay on as acting chief of staff. Mulvaney was in the room.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Newt Gingrich, the Republican House Speaker in the late '90s, said on Monday that there would be no reporters \u2014 who he calls \"enemies of the president\" \u2014 at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue if it was up to him.\u00a0 Gingrich, who catapulted his career largely in part by appearances on cable news, made the comments while he was on CBSN Monday to discuss and promote his new book, \"Trump vs. China: Facing America's Greatest Threat.\"\u00a0 The former speaker of the House was responding to a question from CBSN anchor Vladimir Duthiers, who asked whether Gingrich would have advised going out on camera like Mick Mulvaney did if he were chief of staff. In that news conference last week, Mulvaney\u00a0appeared to admit that the U.S. withheld Ukraine aid in order to get the country to investigate the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\u00a0 \"If I had had the ability to do it, there wouldn't be a White House press corps in the White House,\" Gingrich responded.\u00a0 \"Why is that?\" asked CBSN anchor Anne-Marie Green.\u00a0 \"Because they're all the enemies of the president. I mean why would you call on people who get up every morning saying I hate Donald Trump, I wonder how I can make his life miserable?\" Gingrich answered. \"Well this is the opportunity for the president to speak to the people, right?\" Green interjected. \"No, the president can speak to the people anytime. He doesn't need to speak to a bunch of reporters who are then going to be distorted by their editors,\" Gingrich said.\u00a0 Duthiers pointed out that Gingrich, as speaker of the House, helped stir up political divisions on Capitol Hill and contributed to the hostile rhetoric surrounding the media that is used still today, even by the president himself. Mr. Trump frequently describes the media as \"corrupt\" and the \"enemy of the people,\" and he has praised autocratic leaders of other countries for restricting their press corps. Under Mr. Trump, the United States' press freedom rating has dipped. The U.S. now ranks 48th in the world for press freedom, according to Reporters Without Borders. It was 43rd in 2017.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

Kurdish leadership accused the Turkish military of violating the terms of the truce, in which Kurdish fighters were given five days to move away from a 20-mile-deep \"safe zone\" along Turkey's border. Pentagon officials have told CBS News they've received no instructions as to how to move the Kurdish forces, and there's been no change to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region. Back in Washington, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Thursday that $391 million in military aid to Ukraine was withheld in part to pressure the country to cooperate with a Justice Department investigation into a conspiracy that Ukraine framed Russia for hacking into the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The intelligence community has not substantiated the claim.\u00a0 \"I was involved with the process by which the money was held up temporarily, OK? Three issues for that: the corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in support of the Ukraine and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That's completely legitimate,\" Mulvaney explained. Democrats meanwhile consider Mulvaney's comments a potential turning point in their impeachment inquiry.\u00a0 \"I think Mr. Mulvaney's acknowledgment means that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,\" said Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-California.\u00a0 On Capitol Hill, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sonland told lawmakers in a closed-door session Thursday that he was \"disappointed\" that President Trump had directed him and other diplomats managing U.S. policy toward Ukraine to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. \"Please know that I would not have recommended that Mr. Giuliani or any private citizen be involved in these foreign policy matters,\" Sondland said in his statement. \"However, given the President's explicit direction, as well as the importance we attached to arranging a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, we agreed to do as President Trump directed.\" And as always, we'll turn to our panel for some perspective on the week that was: With the latest news and analysis from Washington, don't miss\u00a0Margaret Brennan\u00a0(@margbrennan) this Sunday on\u00a0\"Face the Nation\"\u00a0(@FaceTheNation).\u00a0 And for the latest from America's premier public affairs program, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Twitter, and\u00a0Instagram.",

            "article_content": "Oslo \u2014\u00a0The Nobel Peace Prize for 2019 was awarded to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia for his efforts to end his country's two-decade border conflict with Eritrea. The Norwegian Nobel Institute also praised the \"important reforms\" that Abiy, Ethiopia's leader since April 2018, has launched at home.\u00a0 The Nobel committee acknowledged there was still much work to be done to see democracy thrive in Ethiopia, but said Abiy had taken great strides in the right direction and they hoped the Peace Prize would help him push further democratic reform. \"Prime Minister Abiy's achievements have not been completed,\" the committee said. \"We recognize that it might be debatable whether it is too early or not... but the committee believes now is the time to recognize, and to encourage.\" Last year,\u00a0Abiy and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki formally restored relations, ending 20 years of enmity and severed ties between the East African nations. They signed agreements to open embassies in their respective capitals, restore flight services and use port facilities in Eritrea. Citizens from both counties immediately began phoning each other to get back in touch. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Abiy was \"one of the main reasons\" he believes the \"winds of hope are blowing ever stronger across Africa.\" \"His vision helped Ethiopia and Eritrea achieve a historic rapprochement,\" Guterres said. \"Prime Minister Ahmed's leadership has set a wonderful example for others in and beyond Africa looking to overcome resistance from the past and put people first.\" \u00a0 At home, Abiy has offered one political surprise after another. He released tens of thousands of prisoners, welcomed home once-banned opposition groups and acknowledged past abuses. People expressed themselves freely on social media, and he announced that Ethiopia would hold free and fair elections in 2020. Media groups noted last year that for the first time, Ethiopia had no journalists in prison. The new prime minister also announced the opening-up of Ethiopia's tightly controlled economy, saying private investment would be welcome in major state-owned sectors. Abiy now faces pressure to uphold the sweeping freedoms he introduced, and critics warn that his ability to deal with rising domestic unrest may be slipping. Ethiopia is facing rising ethnic tensions, as people once stifled by repression now act on long-held grievances. Some 1,200 people have been killed and some 1.2 million displaced in the greatest challenge yet to Abiy's rule.\u00a0 Amnesty International secretary Kumi Naidoo said the award should \"push and motivate (Abiy) to tackle the outstanding human rights challenges that threaten to reverse the gains made so far.\"  \"He must urgently ensure that his government addresses the ongoing ethnic tensions that threaten instability and further human rights abuses,\" Naidoo said.\u00a0 Other names flying around for the award included 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg; German Chancellor Angela Merkel; and activists in Hong Kong.

            "article_content": "The House passed a continuing resolution on Thursday to extend government funding through November 21, in the hopes of avoiding a government shutdown at the end of September. The legislation, which also includes an extension of expiring health care programs, now goes to the Senate for approval. The continuing resolution passed with a vote of 301 to 123. Seventy-six Republicans joined 225 Democrats in voting for the measure, with three Democrats voting against it. \"It is critical that we avoid another government shutdown, which would harm our economy and hardworking Americans,\" House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey said in a statement. \"Once the CR is enacted and the Senate advances their appropriations process, Democrats will negotiate responsible spending bills that uphold our values and give working families a better chance at a better life.\" Congress passed a budget at the end of July which set the spending ceilings for the upcoming fiscal year and suspended the debt ceiling until July 21, 2021 \u2014 beyond the 2020 elections \u2014 but it still had to act on the appropriation bills that fund government operations before the end of September. President Trump signed the budget deal in August. There have been several full or partial government shutdowns in recent years, which has incurred significant costs for taxpayers. A bipartisan report released Tuesday found that government shutdowns have cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion over the past five years, and resulted in an estimated 56,938 years of lost productivity by furloughed workers. The report, released by Republican Senator Rob Portman and Democratic Senator Tom Carper, found that the government has been fully or partially shut down for 52 days since 2014. The most recent shutdown was a 35-day partial shutdown at the beginning of the year which left 800,000 federal employees furloughed or working without pay. The $4 billion figure consists of $3.7 billion in back pay sent to employees prohibited from going to work, and at least $338 million in association with other costs such as administrative work, lost revenue and late fees on interest payments, according to the report. The total amount of combined furlough days also amounts to the nearly 57,000 years of lost productivity. The most recent shutdown\u00a0ended in January, as congressional Democrats were unwilling to concede to Mr. Trump's demands for funding for a border wall. Mr. Trump later\u00a0called a national emergency\u00a0to obtain the funds for the wall. Kimberly Brown contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Detroit \u2014\u00a0Some 48,000 members of the United Auto Workers went on strike early Monday, walking off General Motors factory floors and setting up picket lines as their midnight strike deadline came and went. Workers shut down 33 manufacturing plants in nine states across the U.S. as well as 22 parts distribution warehouses.  It wasn't clear how long the walkout would last, with the union saying GM has budged little in months of talks while GM said it made substantial offers including higher wages and factory investments. Talks were scheduled to resume at 10 a.m. EDT Monday.\u00a0   It's the first national strike by the union since a two-day walkout in 2007 that had little impact on the company.\u00a0 GM workers joined striking Aramark-employed janitors on the picket lines Sunday night at a sprawling factory on the border between Detroit and the small town of Hamtramck.  Worker Patty Thomas said she wasn't scheduled to picket, but came out to support her colleagues at the car plant, which GM wants to close. She said workers gave up cost-of-living pay raises to help GM get through bankruptcy, and workers want some of that back now that the company is in the black.\u00a0 Striking GM employees were joined on the picket lines by workers from Ford and Fiat Chrysler, who are working under contract extensions.  Night shift workers at an aluminum castings factory in Bedford, Indiana, that makes transmission casings and other parts shut off their machines and headed for the exits, said Dave Green, a worker who transferred from the now-shuttered GM small-car factory in Lordstown, Ohio.\u00a0 Green, a former local union president, said he agrees with the strike over wages, plant closures and other issues. \"If we don't fight now, when are we going to fight?\" he asked. \"This is not about us. It's about the future.\"\u00a0 Starting at midnight, the sound of cheers and car horns filled the night air around GM's assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, reports the CBS affiliate there, WANE-TV, as passing motorists expressed support for the strikers. UAW Local 2209 members gathered at the plant exits with picket signs. There was a similar scene at the Parma, Ohio GM plant,\u00a0reports CBS Cleveland affiliate WOIO-TV. UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, the union's top GM negotiator, said a strike was a last resort but was needed because both sides were far apart in negotiating a new four-year contract. The union, he said Saturday, doesn't take a strike lightly.  \"We clearly understand the hardship that it may cause,\" he said. \"We are standing up for fair wages, we are standing up for affordable quality health care, we are standing up for our share of the profits.\" GM, however, said it is offering pay raises and $7 billion worth of U.S. factory investments that would result in 5,400 new positions, a minority of which would be filled by existing employees. GM wouldn't give a precise number. The company also said it offered higher profit sharing, \"nationally leading\" health benefits and an $8,000 payment to each worker upon ratification of a new contract. Because public statements from both sides conflict, it's hard to tell how long the strike will last, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of labor and industry at the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank. The length \"depends on how far apart they really are and where the lines in the sand are drawn,\" she said. Analysts agree that a prolonged walkout could hurt the overall U.S. economy, itself is a major focus of the 2020 presidential race. President Trump is hoping the economy stays strong to boost his re-election bid. He tweeted on Sunday that the two sides should \"Get together and make a deal!\" Several major Democratic presidential hopefuls backed the UAW. Dittes said the union \"stood up for General Motors when they needed us most. Now we are standing together in unity and solidarity for our Members, their families and the communities where we work and live.\" The UAW made major concessions to GM during the auto industry's financial crisis to help keep the company afloat.\u00a0 \u00a0 The union's contract with GM expired Saturday night, but pacts with the company's crosstown rivals, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, were extended indefinitely. The union picked GM as its target company this year, and any deal it negotiates will be used as a template for the others. The UAW said GM was chosen because it's the most profitable of the three and because its plans to close four U.S. factories have angered union members.  On Sunday, about 200 plant-level leaders voted unanimously to strike against GM if no deal could be reached by Sunday night.  Before talks broke off, GM offered to build a new all-electric pickup truck at a factory in Detroit that is slated to close next year, according to a person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The person wasn't authorized to disclose details of the negotiations.  The automaker also offered to open an electric vehicle battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, where it has a huge factory that has already stopped making cars and will be closed. The new factory would be in addition to a proposal to make electric vehicles for a company called Workhorse, the person said.  It's unclear how many workers the two plants would employ. The closures, especially of the Ohio plant, have become lightning rods in the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump has consistently criticized the company and demanded that Lordstown be reopened. Ohio congressman Tim Ryan represents Lordstown and is vying for the Democratic presidential nod. GM has factories in Michigan, Ohio, New York, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Missouri, Indiana and Kansas.  In addition to GM's U.S. vehicle and parts production, the walkout will probably stop the company from making vehicles in Canada and Mexico. That would mean fewer vehicles for consumers to choose from on dealer lots and it would make it impossible to build specially ordered cars and trucks.  Analysts at Cox Automotive said GM has enough vehicles on dealer lots to last about 77 days at the current sales pace. That's well above the industry average of 61. But supplies of the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban large SUVs, which generate big money for the company, are well below the industry average.  The talks this year have been overshadowed by a growing federal corruption probe that snared a top union official on Thursday. Vance Pearson, head of a regional office based near St. Louis, was charged in an alleged scheme to embezzle union money and spend cash on premium liquor, golf clubs, cigars and swanky stays in California. It's the same region that UAW President Gary Jones led before taking the union's top office last year. Jones himself has been touched by the investigation, leading some union members to call for him to step down, but he hasn't been charged.  This year's talks between the union and GM were tense from the start, largely because of GM's plan to close four U.S. factories, including the one in Hamtramck, as well as Lordstown and factories in Warren, Michigan, and near Baltimore.  - GM is making big money, $8 billion last year alone, and workers want a bigger slice. The union wants annual pay raises to guard against an economic downturn, but the company wants to pay lump sums tied to earnings. Automakers don't want higher fixed costs.  - The union also wants new products for the four factories slated to close. GM currently has too much U.S. factory capacity, especially to build slower-selling cars.  - The companies want to close the labor cost gap with workers at plants run by foreign automakers. GM pays $63 per hour in wages and benefits compared with $50 at the foreign-owned factories. GM's gap is the largest at $13 per hour, according to figures from the Center for Automotive Research.  - Union members have great health insurance plans and workers pay about 4% of the cost. Employees at large firms nationwide pay about 34%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Automakers would like to cut costs.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Former South Carolina Congressman Mark Sanford initially planned to announce his presidential candidacy in front of a shrimp boat in Shem Creek or at a podium somewhere inside Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island in his home state, he told CBS News in an interview Sunday. \"But a hurricane came our way,\" he sighed. \"And that went out the window. So we decided to go ahead and drive a stake in the ground. And that's what we did this morning.\" Sanford appeared Sunday morning on \"Fox News Sunday\" with host Chris Wallace to officially launch his longshot presidential bid to unseat President Trump in a primary challenge. From here, he'll begin the arduous task of building out what he calls a \"real\" campaign. \"But that process began today,\" Sanford said, hinting at future campaign tours in the early-voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa. The decision to run came after a handful of conversations with friends \"new and old\" \u2014 some from South Carolina, others from New Hampshire and Iowa. One particularly influential conversation with an \"unnamed lieutenant governor,\" reminded Sanford that the Republican Party \"has lost its way of life.\" In a preview of his stump speech, Sanford bemoaned a Republican abandonment of civic discourse. \"One of the things that I'm going to talk about in this campaign are political norms and institutions,\" he said. Sanford, who was also South Carolina's governor,\u00a0referenced a tweet by President Trump last month. \"When you go out and say that the chairman of the Fed is an enemy of the state, or that you trust a third-world despot more than you do your own intelligence agencies, that erodes the glue that's held our system together for 200 years.\" That argument resonated with \"moms and millennials\" among others, Sanford said. He added, \"A whole lot of other people are saying 'forget it.' This is not what we're trying to teach our kids.\" One of Sanford's main concerns is the nation's spending. In that vein, he criticized the president's request\u00a0to redirect of billions of dollars in military funding for the construction of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. In response to perceived silence from fellow Republicans, Sanford interjected, \"It's not right for Republicans to criticize President Obama's hypothetical actions on this front and be silent on Republican activity. I think it's dangerous.\" In the wake of Hurricane Dorian, Sanford voiced particular concern of funds diverted from FEMA. \"We're just at the front of the hurricane season. And we're not the back end. We're at the front end,\" he noted, reciting the first few letters of the alphabet. \"Dorian is D. You know \u2013 ABCD. We got a long list of letters still to go in this hurricane season. We're not out of the woods.\" Sanford called the\u00a0recent decision by Republican parties in South Carolina and Nevada\u00a0to cancel GOP primaries \"a setback\" and \"alarming bellwether.\" The former South Carolina governor believes his home state is ripe for a \"robust competition of ideas.\" On the politics front, Sanford suggested the decision to take the \"first in the South\" primary off the map is a \"troubling sign\" for the Trump campaign. \"I think it says that in some instances the president's support is a mile wide and an inch deep.\" Before announcing his bid, Sanford called both former Governor Bill Weld and former Representative Joe Walsh on the phone as a courtesy. Weld responded positively, suggesting the case against President Trump is only bolstered by broader competition. Walsh did not pick up the phone, so Sanford left a message. Presidential hopefuls on the Democratic side weighed in on Sanford's bid this morning. \"I hope that people do challenge this president who does not represent the full breadth of the Republican Party,\" Senator Cory Booker said. \"I've never been one to paint with a broad brush and demonize Republicans. I love Americans and I think no side has a monopoly of good ideas.\" \"Republicans should absolutely be challenging Trump because Trump doesn't represent any convention Republican positions. He represents something completely different,\" Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado told CBS News. \"I know why he's getting in. He thinks Trump is fiscally irresponsible.\" \"I think that's the way it ought to be,\" Sanford responded to the comments by his former Democratic colleagues in Congress. \"It's a compliment to who they are as human beings.\" \"I might have sizable political differences with Cory Booker,\" Sanford added. \"But it doesn't mean that we shouldn't have a debate of ideas. That's what's made our country.\" In the months leading up to his announcement, Sanford suggested the goal of his race would be to start a conversation about the U.S. debt and deficit. He called his frugality a \"core part\" of his identity. \"It's not a political uniform.\" The former governor had hopped off a Bolt Bus from Washington, D.C. to New York just before his conversation with CBS News on Sunday. A flight, Sanford reasoned, would have cost $350 or more. \"It was $185 for the train.\" Prices for one-way tickets on the Bolt Bus on Sundays begin at about $28. \"The bus is a horror show if you go out on a Monday, but if you go midday on a Sunday, it's a half an hour longer than the train,\" he continued. \"You're comfortable. You're on the phone the whole time. Boom, you're there.\" He chuckled, admitting, \"I did spring for the extra $7 to get the front left seat. So I had a nice view.\" Asked if he'd take his political campaign to Twitter in an effort to counter the president's messaging, Sanford scoffed, bemoaning what he called a \"cult of personality.\" \"Twitter is not the only way of communication despite popular opinion in some circles.\" He added, \"Trump seems to be the master of the Twitter process. I don't know that I need to play on his turf.\" The president's use of Twitter, Sanford argued, has created some Trump fatigue among conventional Republican voters. \"I think that most people are coming to conclusion that leadership by tweet is not leadership.\" It's not just the tweeting, though. Sanford suspected the president's latest installment of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will wear on Americans. \"The latest statistics show that the trade actions would cost the average household more than thousand dollars,\" he said. \"And more significantly, they will cost jobs.\" Circling back to discussing the Federal Reserve System, Sanford expressed concerns about the possibility of an economic downgrade for the U.S. amid \"economic uncertainty.\" But Sanford conceded he doesn't know how many Republicans would be willing to abandon an incumbent president of their own party. \"That's the big bet of this race. And I don't know which way it will cut.\" But he recalled the \"thousands upon thousands\" of conversations he's had in office with local fisherman, small business owners, and penny-pinching families. \"My belief is that those people have not disappeared.\" He paused. \"If they did, the Trump hunch is right.\" CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

            "article_content": "President Trump rallied supporters Monday night in New Mexico \u2014 a state he lost to Hillary Clinton by eight points in 2016. The Trump campaign is targeting some unexpected states like New Mexico ahead of 2020, with the hopes of besting a Democratic candidate he can portray as too far left for the American mainstream. \"It's been quite a while since a Republican won this state,\" Mr. Trump told supporters, who greeted him with chants of \"USA, USA.\" ''I think we're going to do great here. We're here because we really think we're going to turn this state and make it a Republican state.\" The president's rally in Rio Rancho, in suburban Albuquerque, is the first stop on a three-day swing that will also take him to California for fundraisers expected to raise more than $15 million. Mr. Trump's efforts in New Mexico will provide a test of how well his often-harsh rhetoric about immigrants will play with Hispanic voters, who comprise nearly 40% of New Mexico's electorate. The president also touted his efforts to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall, saying Monday that his administration plans to have almost 500 miles of it built by the end of 2020. \"You're gonna have to really want to get over that wall to do it,\" he said. New Mexico is in the midst of an oil production boom that has boosted employment and spurred a state government spending spree from first-year Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham on public education, roadway projects and tax rebates for film productions. The Green New Deal calls for virtual elimination by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming and meeting 100% of U.S. power demand through renewable and zero-emission energy sources, including nuclear power. The proposal has broad support among Democratic activists and 2020 presidential contenders, putting it at the forefront of the party's sprawling presidential primary. As Mr. Trump eyes other events, including a fundraiser in San Francisco, tensions in the Middle East are at dangerous levels following drone attacks over the weekend that struck the\u00a0world's biggest oil processing facility\u00a0and an oil field in Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration is placing blame on Iran.",

The deadly attacks come as the U.S. is trying to negotiate a peace agreement with the Taliban in Qatar. U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad returned to Qatar unexpectedly on Friday to continue talks with the Taliban after announcing earlier in the week they had reached an agreement \"in principle\" and the deal only needed approval from the Trump administration. And on Tuesday, the Pentagon formally authorized the transfer of $3.7 billion in military funding for the construction of approximately 175 miles of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, a signature campaign promise for the president. 127 current Department of Defense projects \u2014 both overseas and domestic \u2014\u00a0 are expected to be affected by the move.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke that aired Sunday, Sept. 1, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We are now joined by 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke. He's here in studio. Good to have you here.\u00a0 BETO O'ROURKE: Thank you for having me.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are following what has happened in your home state overnight. You've said Americans have functionally accepted as our fate mass shootings are just going to occur. How would your policies have prevented what happened in Odessa and Midland? O'ROURKE: Yeah. I'm also thinking about the people in the Permian Basin in west Texas and Midland and Odessa right now. And I want to make sure that we take action on their behalf and on behalf of everyone in this country. Universal background checks that close every loophole, red flag laws to stop people who have firearms before it is too late- if they pose a danger to themselves or someone else. Ending the sale of weapons of war, AR-15's and AK-47's. They were designed to kill people as effectively, as efficiently, in as great a number as possible. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do we know that that was the type of weapon used in the shooting? O'ROURKE: We don't know, but in El Paso it was a variant of an AK-47 that killed 22 people and grievously injured many more. These are weapons of war and they're used as instruments of terror in our country. And so I think in addition to those steps I just described it is really important that we buy back those weapons of war that are out on our streets right now- millions of them. And also ensure that there is a national licensing and gun registry program. We have in this country more than three hundred and ninety million guns in a nation of three hundred and twenty nine million people. That is a big part of the reason that we lose 40 thousand of our fellow Americans every year. And we cannot accept this anymore. We've got to follow the lead of those moms who demand action, the students who are marching for our lives who themselves have announced ambitious plans to ensure that we can protect one another and that our kids don't have to fear going to school or the future of this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: But in your home state of Texas about 35 percent of people are gun owners. And today even more lenient laws go into effect allowing people to carry weapons into many different places. So do you blame local government there? Because all the prescriptions you're laying out are federal solutions. O'ROURKE: Yeah let- let's not blame anyone. Let's all take responsibility to make this right. So I've talked to gun owners and non-gun owners in every one of the two hundred and fifty four counties of Texas. They're all there on universal background checks and red flag laws. I was at a gun show in Conway, Arkansas talking to owners of AR-15's and AK-47's. Some of them were open to a mandatory buyback program. All of them agreed that we have a crisis and an epidemic of gun violence so-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think public opinion in Texas is changing? I mean in those places-- O'ROURKE: It's there. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that have been seen as really-- O'ROURKE: Yea.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: -- impossible to change laws and convictions that are strongly behind the Second Amendment. O'ROURKE: I remember a woman in Brentwood, Texas a Republican rural conservative community said \"I was born with a 22 in my hands. But I also have more than 20 grandchildren and I want to know whether you're going to represent them or the NRA.\" Though she's a gun owner, though she's conservative, she wants us to take common sense practical steps to protect her grandkids to protect people all over this country. So yes the people of America are there. That leadership- the courage of our convictions just needs to be reflected in our national leadership making sure that we're listening to people not the NRA. People not PACs, people not corporations. When we do that we will save the lives of people. MARGARET BRENNAN: But for your solutions so far- policy prescriptions, you don't know that it would have prevented what happened in Midland and Odessa. O'ROURKE: We're still obviously learning the details. Listened to the press conference last night from the chief of police where they were not able to say what kind of weapon-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 O'ROURKE: -- was used, but I also just watched a video on Twitter of a family that is pinned to the ground, the- the children are crying. They're all Mexican American in a part of our country where Mexican Americans were targeted and hunted for their very ethnicity. People are living with fear, feel like they have targets on their backs right now. Kids afraid to go to school tomorrow morning. This is not right. Unacceptable. And I won't accept it.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well though, about the other gathering storm- the Category 5 hurricane that's headed towards the United States. When you look at the kind of federal preparedness we have now is there something as president you would change about it? Or do you think the system is ready to go? O'ROURKE: I'm really disappointed that President Trump has proposed taking money from FEMA in the middle of hurricane season for walls or cages or militarization of the border that we do not need. As president I would fully fund FEMA. I would invest in the resiliency of communities in Florida and Georgia, the Carolinas, and Puerto Rico to make sure that they're ready for the next storm because the scientists have told these storms are only going to become more frequent, more devastating, and more deadly as the climate continues to change. So the immediate priority is helping those in the path of these storms. But the longer term goal is to confront climate change before it's too late. Free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and fully embrace renewable energy and get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as humanly possible. No later than the year 2050. We- we got to do all of that if we're going to meet this challenge. MARGARET BRENNAN: You rolled out your trade policy this week. New tariffs on China go into place today. Is there a situation where President O'Rourke would ever use tariffs?\u00a0 O'ROURKE: As a last resort. These tariffs are punishing farmers across this country, destroying markets they've worked their entire lives, maybe their parents lives as well to open up now lost to them and to their children. We see a tax on the American consumer that averages about nine hundred dollars a household. And we are hurtling the world and this economy into recession. So end these trade wars. No more tariffs. And then work in concert with our allies and our friends: Canada, Mexico, the European Union. A united front against China and any of their trade practices that are manipulative or damaging to the United States-- MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Does that mean something like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this-- O'ROURKE: --No. MARGARET BRENNAN: trade deal? You wouldn't re-enter that?\u00a0 O'ROURKE: No I- I wouldn't. I would make sure-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --but you're viewed as more friendly to free trade than some of your competitors. O'ROURKE: I- I want to make sure that trade works for us and it works for our farmers and it works for our workers. I want to make sure that our trade deals are used to achieve our goals. I'll give you some examples. I mentioned climate change earlier. This could be the platform for us to get the necessary concessions from trading partners to ensure that we don't warm this planet another degree and a half Celsius. Trade deals could be the platform by which we ensure the dignity of working women and men all over the world- make sure they're paid a fair wage and have working conditions that are safe for them. And it's also a way to make sure that we protect the human rights of our fellow human beings all over the planet. These are our values in this country. Let's use our trade deals to achieve them and make sure that we never do that at the expense of the American worker or the American farmer or the American economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Beto O'Rourke. Good to have you here.\u00a0 O'ROURKE: Thank you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. We'll be back in a moment.",

            "article_content": "President Trump was not happy with Fox News on Wednesday, tweeting \"Fox isn't working for us anymore\" while \"America's Newsroom\" aired on the network. In the tweets, Mr. Trump did not hide his displeasure with some of Fox's 2020 election coverage \u2014 and he suggested the whole network should just \"go left,\" saying he'd win without their help. Mr. Trump's rage was at first directed at host Sandra Smith, who was interviewing DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa. \"Just watched @FoxNews heavily promoting the Democrats through their DNC Communications Director, spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor, @SandraSmithFox,\" the president wrote.\u00a0 \"Terrible considering that Fox couldn't even land a debate, the Dems give them NOTHING! @CNN & @MSNBC are all in for the Open Border Socialists (or beyond). Fox hires 'give Hillary the questions' @donnabrazile, Juan Williams and low ratings Shep Smith. HOPELESS & CLUELESS! They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That's what I do, Win. Too Bad!....\" But Mr. Trump wasn't done. \"I don't want to Win for myself, I only want to Win for the people. The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn't working for us anymore!\" he wrote in a third tweet. ....I don\u2019t want to Win for myself, I only want to Win for the people. The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u2019t working for us anymore! @DonnaBrazile refers to former DNC chairperson and current Fox contributor, Donna Brazile, who came under fire in 2016 when\u00a0WikiLeaks revealed emails\u00a0indicating she gave Hillary Clinton's team a heads-up about presidential debate questions. Mr. Trump also called out Juan Williams, a Fox News political analyst, who recently wrote an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0for The Hill titled \"The real reason for Trump's attack on me.\" \"When Trump tweeted out last week that my political analysis of him was 'nasty,' 'pathetic' and 'wrong,' it led to an instant stream of vile comments via email and on my social media feeds,\" Williams wrote in the op-ed.\u00a0 Williams says Trump \"is engaged in a coordinated attack on every journalist's ability to hold him accountable, call out his lies and critique his failed policies.\"\u00a0 In his tweets on Wednesday, the president also named Shepard Smith, another Fox News anchor who is often critical of the Trump administration.\u00a0 This is not the first time Mr. Trump has taken issue with Smith. Earlier this month, he tweeted that watching CNN, which he calls \"fake news,\" is better than watching Smith's Fox News show. In that tweet, Mr. Trump alleged Smith's show was the lowest rated on Fox News. \"Actually, whenever possible, I turn to\u00a0@OANN!\" the president wrote, referring to the right-wing One America News Network that has published conspiracy theories. Watching Fake News CNN is better than watching Shepard Smith, the lowest rated show on @FoxNews. Actually, whenever possible, I turn to @OANN! In Wednesday's Twitter rant, Mr. Trump did not mention OANN, but he floated the idea of a new outlet now that Fox News \"isn't working for\" his administration anymore. Mr. Trump's Twitter gripe was quickly rebutted by the channel's senior political analyst, Brit Hume. \"Fox News isn't supposed to work for you,\" Hume wrote.\u00a0By contrast, several Fox News prime-time hosts, in particular Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro, have been vocal supporters of Mr. Trump, and he frequently returns the favor by tweeting about their shows. And despite his Twitter barrage, Fox News remains the president's go-to network for giving interviews. He had another one scheduled Thursday morning with Fox News Radio's \"The Brian Kilmeade Show\" \u2014 his 61st interview with Fox News since taking office. No other network has had more than seven. While Mr. Trump said he does not need Fox News, there has long been a close relationship between the network and the Trump White House. The White House has not held a press briefing since March, but former press secretary Sarah Sanders regularly appeared on the network before her departure in June. Fox News announced last week that Sanders had been hired as a contributor.\u00a0 There are other connections between Mr. Trump's former staffers and Fox News: Former White House communications director Hope Hicks is now\u00a0the chief communications director\u00a0for Fox Corporation, former deputy press secretary Raj Shah currently serves as a senior vice president at Fox Corporation, and Mr. Trump's former communications director, Bill Shine, previously was a Fox News executive.\u00a0 -Mark Knoller contributed reporting.

And a number of folks have told us recently that they would love to have us spend an episode talking about Afghanistan. And given where we are today in Afghanistan with the peace talks and the continuing attacks by Taliban, this seems like a great time to do that. And you are the perfect person I think to do that because you've spent so much time thinking about this country from a variety of different perspectives. And so, Mike, I'm gonna spend most of our time talking about Afghanistan. But I do want to ask you up front about two other issues that are in the news. The first is the DNI. Dan Coats, the former DNI, and Sue Gordon, the former Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, have both stepped down. Joe Maguire, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, is now the acting DNI. The president is looking for a permanent replacement for Dan and for Sue. What stands out to you in all of this? How do you think about this?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tWell, I think this is an unusual selection because of the circumstances we find ourselves in. I think I've known Joe for a lot of years. And he'll do a really good job as the acting director. He's a real straight shooter, a military officer Navy SEAL. But it seems to me the credibility of the DNI is very important. Dan Coats had that. And Sue Gordon had that, trusted on the Hill, trusted by the American people to tell it straight. And I think that's critically important. You know, given that the Russians intervened in our election last time and they continue to do that and will do that in 2020, having a DNI that really will tell it straight to the congress, to the American people and then therefore has bipartisan support I think is really critical. You know, that's always important in an intelligence officer. It's even more important now. So I hope they pick an intelligence professional essentially that has that credibility and non-partisan nature.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tThe second issue, Mike, is the rebound of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. There's now been multiple statements from U.S. and foreign officials about that. People are talking about 14 to 18,000 ISIS guys along the Iraq/ Syria border. How do you think about this?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tSure. Well, you know, the physical caliphate was liberated and destroyed. But ISIS fighters haven't gone away. They just scattered. And so ISIS is far from defeated in that region. And the pressure on them has reduced. And so as you know from our experience in counterterrorism, the longer you let terrorist groups reconstitute, the more dangerous they become if they have some form of sanctuary and can plan. And so it's very important to keep pressure on. If you look at what the emergence of ISIS as it morphed from Al Qaeda in Iraq to ISIS last time, they had a very systematic campaign in the Sunni areas targeting tribal leaders who had risen up against them. And by 2014, you know, they were able to take big chunks of Iraq. And so the danger is still there very much. This relates in some way to the Afghanistan topic. But like it or not, we face global jihadi threats in four areas of the near east and north Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan being one, Syria, Iraq another, sort of Yemen, Somalia and then north Africa sort of centered on Libya but into the Sahel. And we have to continue to keep pressure on those groups so they don't pose a threat to the American homeland.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tOkay. Mike, Afghanistan. Perhaps a little history first. Can you walk us through kind of a rough arc of the war in Afghanistan from 9/11 to today, kind of the cliff notes version of that?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tSure. So after the horrendous 9/11 attacks, the U.S. mounted a very successful campaign to depose the Taliban and the Al Qaeda sanctuary in Afghanistan. That basically took a few months to accomplish. But Al Qaeda and the Taliban didn't go away. Most of them, certainly all the key leadership, fled to Pakistan. Some went to Iran where they reconstituted a threat. The Taliban beginning in about 2003 started insurgency up again in Afghanistan. We had battles in 2002. But there were more people still trying to get out of Afghanistan. And until roughly 2008 the war was mostly concentrated in the south or the Pashtun heartland around Kandahar. And then it became more lethal both in the east and south. As the situation deteriorated in Afghanistan, U.S. forces built up, concluding with President Obama's decision to essentially triple the force between 2009 and 2010 to almost 100,000 troops for a couple years. That force was able to really push the Taliban back to essentially 2006 levels or so. But after we drew down, they came back as we transitioned in 2014 to a train, advise and assist or supporting mission. And the Taliban now control more territory in Afghanistan than they did, certainly a decade ago. And attacks are just as numerous.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tAnd what's been the relationship between the Taliban and Al Qaeda during that period?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tSo the Taliban had never really renounced Al Qaeda. But the core Taliban leadership had been centered in the south of Pakistan. One of their arms, the Haqqani Network, centered in north Waziristan, has provided sanctuary to Al Qaeda for decades and has planned with them and done attacks as has a related group, the Pakistani Taliban, that have the same philosophy but have different leadership and are on the Pakistan side. And so there's been a very close relationship between insurgents and global jihadists.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo Mike, I want to talk just for a second about ISIS in Afghanistan which you mentioned before. What's the relationship between the Taliban and ISIS? It's a bit different than it is between the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Correct?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tIt is. So ISIS in Afghanistan, Pakistan is what ISIS calls a province of its central command, or ISIS Khorasan, an ancient region that spans part of Iran, part of China, central Asia and Afghanistan. And ISIS Afghanistan was formed -- or Khorasan -- in 2014, 2015 from defectors from the Taliban and also defectors from the Pakistan Taliban or the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan. A number of those leaders have been killed. But they've developed a fairly lethal force rising to about 3,000 fighters or so. Now they may be down to under a couple thousand. They've been battered pretty heavily by U.S. air power and Afghan Special Operations forces. But they're still a formidable threat as witnessed by the attack in Kabul on this Hazara wedding ceremony last few days.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tThere was a New York Times piece, Mike, I don't know about a week ago, a week and a half ago that talked about a bit of a debate between the U.S. military and the U.S. intelligence community about whether ISIS in Afghanistan is a threat to the homeland. And the article said the military sees a bigger threat than the IC sees. What's your sense?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tYeah. I'm more on the IC side of this, that, for now, they're really a regional threat. Most global jihadist groups only have the capabilities to do regional attacks. And that tends to be their priority anyway. That doesn't mean they don't have the ambition to do global attacks. They share the same ideology. But ISIS Afghanistan at this point doesn't have the same extra regional capabilities that ISIS in Syria, for example, had until they were really battered and being able to attack in Europe and threaten the United States. If you look at Al Qaeda, you see the same kind of pattern. Core Al Qaeda had that for the longest time. Al Qaeda in Yemen and Al Qaeda in Syria developed it to a bit. Other groups, Somalia, north Africa really have been regional, or Al Qaeda and the Indian subcontinent. So this falls in that pattern. But they certainly have the ambition to do it.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tAnd then maybe kind of one more kind of setting the stage question here. And I understand this is not in what you do every day. But what's your sense of what the level of political support there is in the United States to maintain our involvement in Afghanistan?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tWell, that's certainly one of the challenges that we face is, you know, certainly President Trump but also several prominent Democrats running for president have pledged to withdraw forces from Afghanistan. And I think, one, national security is really not a front burner issue in our politics right now, despite the fact that the threats to the United States from a rising China and a resurgent Russia and regional powers and global jihadist is greater than it's been since the Cold War. There's just this disconnect there. And I think too many of our senior political leaders tend to view Afghanistan through a prism of Vietnam, as a local war that you can just exit rather than a fight with global jihadists that will go on for a long time -- and really just look at it as a source of funds, you know, that they would rather redeploy those funds to the United States but at some risk. So that's certainly a challenge for national security professionals to try to shape that debate in some way about the danger if we tend to view this war with the global jihadist through the wrong prism. You know, the comparison I like to draw is that the Columbian insurgency has been going on for 55 years. So Afghanistan may be America's longest war. And it's a small war, at this point more of an intelligence war. But Columbia's been going on three times as long as that. And they've had kind of on and off peace agreements. But it took strong U.S. support through the last decade and a half to really get them to that point.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tMike, let's kind of move forward to where we are today. And militarily where would you say we are between the Taliban and the Afghan Security Forces. Where's that balance?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tSo the Afghan government, you know, controls the major population centers and certainly most of the lines of communications between them. But the insurgency has been getting stronger. And so if you look at the number of attacks, they've ramped up after 2014. And they've been maintained at a fairly high level despite some changes in U.S. strategy. As the long as the U.S. is engaged in providing material but also psychological support to the Afghan Security Forces and provides air power and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, the Taliban can't win.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tCan't get to those populations.\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tYeah. And so in fact what you see is a lot of the Taliban attacks, they'll do their high profile attacks occasionally, or other groups like ISIS recently in Kabul will do spectacular attacks in Kabul. But most are now attacks on outposts. Or as a couple years ago, the Taliban were able to overrun district centers because we had more restrictions on air power. So the U.S. is a pretty critical variable in this balance of power. You know, if you look at it on paper, Afghan National Security Forces are about high 300,000. Of course not everybody is manning their positions at all times.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tNot everybody shows up for work. (LAUGH)\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tNot everybody shows up for work. You know, Taliban and all insurgents are, you know, a tenth of that or so.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tYeah. And what's your sense of the quality of Afghan Security Forces?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tIt varies. It's one of the reasons for a shift in strategy is that we now use Afghan Special Forces as the primary offensive force.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tAnd they're pretty good.\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tAnd they're pretty good. They're very well trained. And then the large cores in Afghanistan, the conventional forces are there to follow up and then try to hold. The Afghan police have taken the brunt of a lot of these attacks particularly in small outposts. You know, for the last several years, Afghan Security Forces have been losing and killed in action what the United States lost in the totality of the Iraq War every year, five to 10,000 troops essentially every year. So they've paid quite a high cost.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tOkay. Mike, the peace talks. Can you describe the status of those? I know the deal that's being discussed is not public. But some pieces of it have leaked out. Can you give us a sense of what that might look like as a starter to the discussion on that?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tSure. There's really two key elements to this. The first is that these are talks between the United States and the Taliban not as you'd expect between the Afghan government. The Taliban have refused to do that thus far. So talks that have been going on, there are several rounds. I think we're in our ninth round now over the past year, thereabouts, in Doha, Qatar have been between the Taliban and our special envoy, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad. There's four pillars to the peace talks: troop withdrawal -- the Taliban want all U.S. troops out of the country. Counterterrorism guarantees -- From the U.S. perspective want the Taliban to affirm that they've broken with Al Qaeda and that they will not provide sanctuary, not let the territory of Afghanistan be used for these terrorist groups that could mount attacks on the U.S. homeland. And then direct negotiation or peace talks with the Afghan government, intra-Afghan talks, and then, finally, a ceasefire. And so there was quick agreement on the basic framework for a troop withdrawal and these counterterrorism guarantees early in the year. And the talks have been essentially stalemated since on these last two. And that really is the rub. The U.S. has made essentially concessions to the Taliban without getting the intra-Afghan dialogue. The Taliban consider the Afghan government illegitimate and if they talk to them, they say they'll only talk to them in a personal capacity, not as a government, but just as Afghans. And then the cease fire, it should give Americans pause that the Taliban offensive for 2019 is named Operation Victory. They're continuing the fighting. The leader of the Taliban has said, \"We're gonna fight till we achieve our objectives.\" And so a cease fire is a long way off.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tI guess this is the fundamental question. Do you think the Taliban is willing to live up to the commitments that it makes?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tI don't think their commitments mean much on the counterterrorism side because, number one, if you look at some of their attitudes where they've recently said the U.S. deserved 9/11 for its intervention, its policies, and its intention to continue fighting until it achieves its objectives. Second, the Taliban is not a monolithic movement. It splinters off groups. ISIS in Afghanistan is one of them. So even if they had the intention of controlling and they could really only do that if they were the government rather than power sharing in a government which they just see as a step toward what they really want. But then also there's significant Taliban elements linked with the global jihadists that are in Pakistan. The Haqqani Network for example. And so it really seems to me their counterterrorism guarantees can be on paper. But it's hard to see how they would have the capability to really police them even if they wanted to, just given the dispersity of the threat, the fragmentation of the threat and their limited control. You know, what we have in Afghanistan right now is a friendly government with large security forces supported by the United States, advisors and air power. The Taliban with the best of intentions would be orders of magnitude below that.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo, Mike, paint us a picture of what you think would happen in Afghanistan if we pulled out?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tSo I think it would very much look like what it looked like in Iraq, which is, U.S. withdrawals don't mean the end of the conflict. They just mean in a lot of cases the U.S. pulls out its forces. And so, you know, we maintained an embassy in Iraq after 2011. We had robust intelligence forces. But we essentially had disengaged from our military campaign in terms of advisors and others. And we were providing security assistance much as we do with many countries around the world. Three years later, you know, or in the subsequent three years, ISIS did a systematic campaign, first through assassination and other things, to coerce Sunni areas. And then our big investment in the Iraqi security forces essentially almost collapsed as ISIS was on the gates of Baghdad. And so I think within a matter of years if the U.S. reduced aid, and essentially if it went to the Iraq model, and then, even worse, reduced aid because Afghanistan is more dependent on international aid for defense than Iraq ever was, that you would see something like that.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tAnd then how long before the extremist groups that would be surviving in that environment, how long before they would, in your mind, become a threat to the homeland?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tSo it usually takes a couple years, if they're left unmolested. But that would occur during that period. You know, from the time that the U.S. essentially withdraws, those groups would be unmolested, whether they're aligned with the Taliban or not. And nobody would be policing that.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo Mike, here's maybe a tough question, in some ways impossible to answer. But I'm gonna ask it anyway. You're not the only one who thinks the way you just said. Most national security officials believe what you just said about Afghanistan. So with that in mind, do the diplomats who are negotiating with the Taliban understand this? Or are they deluding themselves into believing that the Taliban is actually going to do what they say? What do you think?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tWell, as Secretary Pompeo made clear the other day, they have their marching orders from the president. And I think they're trying to do the best they can, given the circumstances. Unfortunately, you know, as you said, most national security professionals would be very skeptical of this. And I think, as our former ambassador to Afghanistan twice, and five other countries, Ryan Crocker, said, that this isn't a peace deal. This is surrender. And it's hard to see how it becomes less than that. You know, the Pentagon just released a report that, while some of the global jihadist threat has been beaten down significantly in the Afghanistan/Pakistan theater, it still is the greatest concentration of global jihadists on the planet. And that's when they've been pounded for 18 years. You know, imagine after they have a couple years where no one's pounding really.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo Mike, there's a parallel here. And you actually mentioned it already, Vietnam. There's a parallel here I think between Afghanistan and Vietnam. Paris peace talks, North Vietnamese agree that they're not going to send troops south. Two years later, Saigon falls. People often make this comparison. I've heard Bob Gates make it. I've heard others make it. One of the things that stands out to me, though, is the consequences of it happening in Afghanistan are so much greater than the consequences of what happened in Vietnam, because of the ability of these extremist groups to reach out and touch us. Is that your sense too?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tThat is. Because, again, the aims of the global jihadist movement is to start this global war with the United States as its main enemy, and then local enemies also on the list from time to time. You know, if the global jihadists played by Las Vegas rules, that what happened in Las Vegas stayed in Las Vegas, it would be like Vietnam or Lebanon, for example. We withdrew from Lebanon after Hezbollah bombings in the 1980s. Hezbollah didn't really follow us home. They remained a very serious threat. But they're different from the global jihadists. Our experience with the jihadists, certainly before and after 9/11, in the two decades, is that, when you give them a respite, or they have a safe haven, they exploit it for their aims. And that's just the reality of the world that we live in.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tYeah. So, you know, you and I worked together for a long time on counterterrorism. And I think, for me, you know, one of the fundamental lessons learned is: If you do not keep pressure on these guys, they bounce back and they bounce back pretty quickly.\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tYes, I agree.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo here's another tough question. I've asked you a whole bunch of tough questions. Here's another one. So what should we do? You know, if you were advising the president about what he should do in Afghanistan, what would you tell him?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tSo I think he has to reframe the narrative, you know, and our aims. Our aims are not to turn Afghanistan into some central Asian Valhalla, as my old boss, Bob Gates, said, but to ensure that we don't get hit from that region again, like we did on 9/11. Now that's not that American values don't matter. Afghanistan has been an area where American national security interests and values have coincided to a degree. You know, in 2001 there were only several hundred thousand children in school in Afghanistan. None of them were girls. Today there's eight million. And 40% of them are girls. And women occupy positions of power in politics and commerce. And that's all to the good. But there is a significant cost with Afghanistan. There's been a cost in American lives. There's a tremendous financial cost. We supply $4 billion or so to fund the Afghan national security forces. The government of Afghanistan provides about 1/10 of that. They're just not able to stand on their own two feet in that regard. And the cost of our deployment is several billion more. But it's cheap compared to the cost of another 9/11. And that's the challenge for national security policy and our political leaders. Again, I look at, you know, the Colombia example, where we're better off with Colombia today than we would've been with the FARC. They were relatively modest investments, certainly in U.S. dollars, to produce that result. But it took a lot of time. It took a lot more than 18 years to get that result.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo you would maintain our presence there?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tYeah, I think you can reduce the presence by up to half. President Trump inherited, you know, 8,000-plus troops, you know, added another 5,000-6,000 in his own little mini-surge. There's talk in the first stage of a withdrawal of going back, essentially reversing the mini-surge. I think we can carry out our intelligence mission and our counterterrorism mission with that reduced footprint. But that's about the best I think we can do. If we went strictly to the Iraq model, after 2011, where we pulled out all our forces and our forward intelligence presence, I think you'd see a lot of Taliban gains. If we really cut off aid, I think you'd see a government collapse.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tBut you don't hear anybody talking about this $4 billion in aid, right, what happens to that, as part of this deal?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tRight.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tRight? It's interesting.\u00a0 You've been in the sit room many times. Let's say the president decided to do what you recommended, right, and to keep troops there indefinitely, until there are conditions, right, that ensure that we are protected in our homeland, which, by the way, is what he decided in 2017, right?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tRight.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tHow would you sell that to the American people who are so tired of this war?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tSo, again, I think that's the task of political leadership, to reframe the question of the conflict we find ourselves in with global jihadists. And, you know, the same applies to Syria and Iraq or Yemen and Somalia or North Africa. You know, if you can safely pull out of Syria and Iraq and, you know, we seem to be in the midway phase of that, and you can do it Afghanistan, well, why not the other theaters as well? And then over time your risk gets magnified, as this global jihadist threat has multiple theaters from which to operate.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tMike, one last question. You've spent more time, from a policy perspective and an operational perspective, looking at Afghanistan, maybe more than anybody else. And I'm just wondering, looking back, if you see lost opportunities, in terms of how the U.S. has approached Afghanistan? You know, after the Russians left, were there lost opportunities? After the Taliban was pushed from power, and Al Qaeda was pushed into Pakistan, were there lost opportunities? Did we overreach with our goals? Was Vice President Biden right at the end of the day, in saying our policies should be counterterrorism, not counter-insurgency? How do you think about that?\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tI think all of those are good points. So certainly, you know, in the '90s, by viewing Afghanistan as a local problem, and then doing a missile strike after embassy bombings in 1998, that was a path that led us to 9/11. And we certainly don't want to repeat that experience. Now, you know, Afghanistan had a horrible civil war after the Soviets were driven out, that eventually brought the Taliban to power. We had broken relations essentially with Pakistan, not formal diplomatic relations, but it cut off all military aid and had very strained relationship. And so, you know, it was not an easy situation, I think. CIA I thought was quite prescient in identifying the danger of the Afghan sanctuary in the late '90s. And we didn't do enough about it. After 9/11 I think Iraq diverted us, to some degree, from Afghanistan. But I think also our aims, and what could be accomplished, I do agree with the point that I think we overreached, and that our long-term strategy in Afghanistan has to be counterterrorism with reasonable nation building. Because it's gotta be sustained a long time. We never really solved the problem of the Pakistan sanctuary, which prolongs the war dramatically. And so there have been a number of things I think we could've done better over time. But given where we are now, if the aim of America's intelligence and defense establishments is really to prevent a big attack on the United States, whether through deterrence or through limited action, Afghanistan and all of our counterterrorism efforts are really a small fraction of our national security investment. And, you know, the return is reasonably good, in terms of security for the American people.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo if I was going to sum up our conversation, it would be Afghanistan remains an extremely important national security issue. And we're at a critical inflection point here. And we can do the right thing. But we can make another mistake.\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tYes. I think that's right.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tMike, it's been great to have you on the show.\t\tMICHAEL VICKERS:\tIt's great to be here.\t\t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "MIAMI \u2014 President Trump was in full sales mode Monday, doing everything but pass out brochures as he touted the features that would make the Doral golf resort the ideal place for the next G-7 Summit \u2014 close to the airport, plenty of hotel rooms, separate buildings for every delegation, even top facilities for the media. There's just one detail he left out: He owns the place. Government ethics watchdogs have long railed against the perils of Mr. Trump Court sides with Trump administration in lawsuit over hotel profits and hosting foreign leaders at his properties. But they say Trump's proposal to bring world leaders to his Miami-area resort takes the conflict of interest to a whole new level because, unlike stays at his Washington, they would have no choice but to spend money at his property. \"It's ethics violation squared,\" said Kathleen Clark of Washington University School of Law in St. Louis. Added Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, \"This is him making it perfectly mandatory that they stay at his resort.\" Mr. Trump's proposal at the current G-7 Summit in Biarritz, France, portrayed the Doral resort in the most glowing terms, even though he said later he was more interested in logistics for the meeting than making money. \"We have a series of magnificent buildings ... very luxurious rooms,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants, it's like \u2014 it's like such a natural.\" The president's pitch comes as several lawsuits accusing the president of violating the U.S. Constitution's emoluments clause, which bans gifts from foreign governments, wind their way through the courts. It also comes as Doral, by far the biggest revenue generator among the Trump Organization's 17 golf properties, appears to have taken a hit from Trump's move into politics. The trouble began during soon after Mr. Trump announced he was running for the presidency in 2015 with a speech that called Mexican immigrants crossing the border illegally rapists and murders. Businesses started cutting ties to the president. The PGA and NASCAR moved events that used to be booked at Doral elsewhere. Eric Trump, who is overseeing the business with his older brother, Don Jr., told The Associated Press last year that \"the Doral is on fire.\" But a financial disclosure report filed with the federal government this year showed revenue at the club has barely been growing \u2014 up just $1 million to $76 million. Mr. Trump's financial disclosure also shows he owes a lot of money to Deutsche Bank for the property, which helped him buy it in 2012. As of the end of last year, Mr. Trump had two mortgages on the resort, one for more than $50 million, the other for as much as $25 million. A Trump Organization consultant told the Miami-Dade Value Adjustment Board last year that the property was \"severely underperforming,\" according to The Washington Post. The local government cut the resort's assessed value for 2018 from $110.3 million to $105.6 million, according to county records. Another sign of trouble is the long list of former Doral members who quit the club years ago but are still waiting for their initial deposits back. New members have to join first for old ones to get refunds, but that isn't happening, according to Doral member Peter Brooke. He says some former members have been waiting for 10 years or longer. Brooke said a G-7 summit would bring in \"considerable income\" for the club, citing the need to accommodate Secret Service, guards and other staff that must accompany each foreign government delegation. \"They would have to house all of them at the various lodges, not to mention food and more staff,\" he said. In an effort to assuage critics, Mr. Trump agreed before he took office to donate profits from foreign government spending at its properties. But the company is private, so it's not certain the $340,000 donated so far is all of the profits, or even precisely how \"profits\" is defined. The company has also said it doesn't actively seek foreign government business, and even tries to turn it away. Earlier this year, Eric Trump said the company goes \"to great lengths\" to discourage such spending. It's not clear how hosting the G-7 would square with this policy. The Trump Organization did not respond to several requests for comment. At Monday's news conference, Mr. Trump spoke as if the idea of making money off the summit never entered his mind. In fact, he said, other people were pushing Doral as a venue \u2014 not just him. He said the Secret Service and the military have been visiting various sites and appear to have formed a bit of consensus already. \"They went to places all over the country and they came back and they said, 'This is where we'd like to be,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's not about me. It's about getting the right location.\" He then added: \"I'm not going to make any money. I don't want to make money. I don't care about making money.\"",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration froze all Venezuelan government assets in a dramatic escalation of tensions with Nicol\u00e1s Maduro that places his socialist administration alongside a short list of adversaries from Cuba, North Korea, Syria and Iran that have been targeted by such aggressive U.S. actions. The ban, blocking American companies and individuals from doing business with Maduro's government and its top supporters, took effect immediately Monday and is the first of its kind in the Western Hemisphere in more than three decades, following an asset freeze against Gen. Manuel Noriega's government in Panama and a trade embargo on the Sandinista leadership in Nicaragua in the 1980s. While the order falls short of an outright trade embargo \u2014 notably, it spares Venezuela's still sizable private sector \u2014 it represents the most sweeping U.S. action to remove Maduro since the Trump administration recognized\u00a0opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3\u00a0as Venezuela's rightful leader in January. Critically, it also exposes foreign entities doing business with the Maduro government to U.S. retaliation. \"The apparent goal is to give the U.S. the ability to apply the law beyond its borders to allies of Maduro like China, Russia, Cuba, Iran and Turkey,\" said Russ Dallen, the Miami-based head of Caracas Capital Markets brokerage. \"Should those foreign entities continue doing business with Maduro they can have their U.S. assets seized.\" The executive order signed by President Donald Trump justified the move by citing Maduro's \"continued usurpation of power\" and human rights abuses by security forces loyal to him. U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton hinted earlier Monday that far-reaching U.S. action was close at hand. Speaking to reporters on the eve of an international conference in Peru to show support for Guaid\u00f3, he said that the U.S. was readying measures \"that will show the determination that the United States has to get a peaceful transfer of power.\" Russia, which has staunchly backed Maduro, denounced the U.S. action. Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the Russian upper house's international affairs committee, said Tuesday the move amounts to \"international banditry.\" He added in remarks carried by the state RIA Novosti news agency that it represents an \"open meddling into Venezuela's internal affairs.\" The measures are likely to exacerbate suffering in an already moribund economy marked by six-digit hyperinflation and a deep, multi-year contraction that surpasses that of the Great Depression in the U.S. Previous sanctions targeting the South American nation's oil industry, the source of almost all of its export earnings, have already accelerated a crash in oil production that started with Maduro's election in 2013 following the death of his mentor Hugo Chavez. More than 100 officials and government insiders also have had their U.S. assets frozen and blocked from doing business with Americans. As part of the executive order, Americans or U.S. companies that do business with such individuals face penalties. The same Maduro supporters will also be banned from entering the U.S. Exceptions will be allowed for the delivery of food, medicine and clothing. Transactions with Venezuela's still sizable private sector do not appear to be affected either. It's unclear how the actions will affect American oil giant Chevron, which last month received a three-month exemption from the U.S. Treasury to allow it to continue drilling for oil with state-run oil monopoly PDVSA. The Maduro government has yet to respond. But Guaid\u00f3 celebrated the U.S. action, saying it would protect Houston-based oil company CITGO, Venezuela's most valuable overseas asset, from attempts by Maduro to mortgage its assets. \"Any individual, company, institution or nation that tries to do business with the regime will be seen by the international justice system as collaborating with and sustaining a dictatorship,\" Guaid\u00f3 said in a series of late-night Tweets. \"They will be subject to sanctions and considered an accomplice to crimes.\" Geoff Ramsey, a researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America, said that the measures will aggravate a humanitarian crisis even with the exceptions in place to protect the most vulnerable as Western banks avoid processing even legitimate transactions. \"The truth is that no financial institution wants to run afoul of the Treasury Department,\" he said. Instead of doubling down on the same embargo strategy that has failed for decades to produce regime change in communist Cuba, he thinks the U.S. should do more to support ongoing negotiations being sponsored by Norway between Maduro and Guaid\u00f3 representatives. Bolton and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross are representing the United States at what host Peru has dubbed the International Conference for Democracy in Venezuela, a gathering of 59 nations that with few exceptions back Guaid\u00f3 and consider\u00a0Maduro's reelection last year\u00a0to be fraudulent. Moments after the executive order was announced, Bolton tweeted that he was looking ahead to what he hopes will be a \"productive\" day in Lima, Peru.",

            "article_content": "Here's what you need to know in politics this week... WHERE THE CANDIDATES STAND ON GUNS While President Trump makes no secret of his affection for legal gun ownership and the NRA, some Democratic candidates want sweeping changes to gun laws, including the registration and licensing of new firearms. Here's a rundown on where some of the 2020 candidates stand on the issue in the aftermath of the horrific mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso over the weekend.\u00a0 SEN. CORY BOOKER\u00a0released a plan in May that CBS News Campaign Reporter Jack Turman called \"the most extensive gun violence prevention proposal put forth by a presidential candidate to date.\" Booker's plan, Turman wrote, \"prioritizes a gun licensing program whereby gun owners would be required to obtain a gun permit and pass an FBI background check. Under the proposal, the gun permit would be valid for up to five years.\" For more of his plan,\u00a0click here. The senator also released a gun suicide prevention plan that\u00a0can be found here.\u00a0 FORMER REP. JOHN DELANEY\u00a0released a gun control plan in June that he says would mandate universal background checks, ban assault weapons and bump stocks, close the \"boyfriend loophole\" that activists say allows people who have stalked, abused or assaulted others to still buy guns, and end the ban on gun violence research. For more on his plan,\u00a0click here.\u00a0 SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND unveiled a plan last month that she says would target gun trafficking at the federal level, expand background checks and close loopholes on gun sales, ban military-style assault weapons, and increase federal resources and gun violence accountability measures for local law enforcement. For more on her plan, click here.\u00a0 SEN. KAMALA HARRIS says she would give Congress 100 days to mandate near-universal background checks, revoke licenses of gun manufacturers and dealers that break law regardless of protections, close the \"boyfriend loophole\", ban all AR-15-style assault rifles, among other changes to existing law. For more on her plan, click here.\u00a0 FORMER GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER would create national standards for gun licensing, oppose concealed carry laws, fund local community-based programs to \"break the cycle\" of gun violence in urban areas, use new technology to stop mass shootings, institute national universal background checks, and raise the age to buy firearms to 21. For more of his plan, click here.\u00a0\u00a02020 DEMS DECRY \"ANOTHER MASS SHOOTING\" Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Alexander Tin: Convening in southern Nevada for a labor union's annual forum this weekend, Democratic presidential candidates soon found themselves reacting to news of \"another mass shooting.\" \"One is speechless in trying to make a rational statement about another mass shooting in this country,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders told reporters\u00a0at the AFSCME forum\u00a0in Las Vegas. \"It is deeply concerning that we have Senate leadership more concerned with pleasing the NRA, than listening to the vast majority of the American people,\" the Vermont independent lamented. Saturday's\u00a0shooting in El Paso, followed by another\u00a0massacre overnight in Ohio, thrust frustration over congressional inaction back into the spotlight at the gathering of 19 White House hopefuls, mere minutes from the Las Vegas Strip where a gunman\u00a0killed nearly 60\u00a0in 2017 in the bloodiest mass shooting in modern American history.\u00a0 \"This is beyond anything we should be tolerating,\" said former Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday, after news broke of the attack in Texas. \"We can beat the NRA. We can beat the gun manufacturers,\" he insisted. News of the massacre in El Paso prompted former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke to abruptly cancel planned campaign events in Nevada and California, returning home to the Texas border town he used to represent. \"I just ask for everyone's strength for El Paso right now. Everyone's resolve to make sure that this does not continue to happen in this country,\" O'Rourke\u00a0told reporters\u00a0before departing the Las Vegas event, visibly shaken. \"This is really about hatred and racism and intolerance that continues to grow in this country,\" he later told \"Face the Nation\" from El Paso,\u00a0accusing the president\u00a0of sowing division.\u00a0 And O'Rourke, like several of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, laid the blame for the El Paso shooting at the feet of President Trump. \"I'm saying that President Trump has a lot to do with what happened in El Paso yesterday,\" O'Rourke added.\u00a0 DEMS DESCEND ON IOWA COUNTY FAIR Via CBS News Campaign Reporters Adam Brewster and Musadiq Bidar: Over the next two weeks, 23 Democratic presidential candidates will descend on Iowa for the State Fair and the Wing Ding Dinner in Clear Lake. At the fair, candidates will get 20 minutes at the Des Moines Register Soapbox to address crowds before heading off for retail politicking at the fair in the form of hand shaking, baby holding, pork chop flipping and fried food consumption.\u00a0 On the fair's busiest days -- the first Friday, Saturday and Sunday -- more than 100,000 people typically attend the annual event, giving candidates exposure to a large audience. The Wing Ding Dinner on Friday night will give the candidates a chance to give their pitch to Democrats from some of the more rural communities in northern Iowa. The events are two of the critical opportunities for candidates who have less than four weeks to hit the polling and donor thresholds to qualify for the third debate in September to speak to a range of Iowans. \"I think the thing about the State Fair is, it's a great equalizer for Iowa voters,\" said Polk County Democrats Chair Sean Bagniewski, who added that it gives candidates a chance to speak to people who aren't attending Democratic presidential events.\u00a0 But former Democratic operative Grant Woodard says the Iowa State Fair isn't necessarily going to give lower tier candidates the boost they may be looking for, unless they can give a \"remarkable speech\" at the \"soapbox\" where candidates traditionally speak to the crowds.\u00a0 \"You're not going to resurrect your campaign at the State Fair,\" Woodard said, adding that the event has become something candidates are expected to do, but isn't necessarily the best place for politics. \"Nobody wants to talk about (politics) there. People want to drink their beer and eat their food on a stick and go around and see the sights.\" Woodard says for some candidates Labor Day will be a breaking point of whether their campaigns can continue into the fall. He says if a campaign can't put together a three day Iowa trip where the candidate is the main draw, rather than attending larger events organized by a county or local elected official, there may not be a path forward. \"If you get to Labor Day and your campaign does not have the capacity to do that, then, quite frankly, you just need to get the hell out of the race,\" Woodard said. For those of you lucky to attend, or who'd like to see what we'll be trying to eat this week, here's a look at all of the\u00a0food on a stick\u00a0you can buy and all of the\u00a0new foods\u00a0we'll be taste testing in addition to the fair classics.

            "article_content": "President Trump signed budget legislation which suspends the debt ceiling for two years Friday afternoon. The Senate passed the deal, cut between the White House and Democratic congressional leaders, on Thursday. The budget will raise spending by $324 billion and would also suspend the debt ceiling until July 2021, eliminating the prospect of an ugly battle before the 2020 election. The bill passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis with 67 yeas to 28 nays. Last week,\u00a0the House passed the two-year spending and debt limit deal\u00a0284 to 149, with 219 Democrats voting in favor and 16 voting against. Sixty-five Republicans supported the measure. However, some fiscal hawks in the Republican Party opposed the bill. Here is what you need to know about the budget deal: The two-year budget will increase spending by $320 billion and allows the government to keep borrowing, even as the federal deficit approaches $1 trillion. The widening deficit, which was $587 billion in 2016, is due in part to increased government spending and the $1.5 trillion tax cut package signed by Mr. Trump in 2017. The government's debt has increased significantly since Mr. Trump took office in 2017. When he became president, the national debt was $19 trillion, and it's now reached a high of $22 trillion. In 2016, the president promised he'd eliminate the national debt over an eight-year period. Spending on military programs will increase under the budget deal. Since he took office, Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he'd increase military spending.\u00a0 It will also include increases in spending on domestic programs, a concession for congressional Democrats. According to the New York Times, this increase in domestic spending includes $2.5 billion for the 2020 census. In a letter to House Democrats urging them to vote for the bill, Pelosi noted that \"non-defense budget authority exceeds the defense number by $10 billion over the next two years,\" and that \"Democrats have secured an increase of more than $100 billion in funding for domestic priorities since President Trump took office.\" Essentially, Democrats are happy because they get greater domestic spending, while Mr. Trump keeps his promise to increase military spending. The increase in spending will be partially offset by $77 billion in cuts. Democrats also agreed not to include any \"poison pills\" in the final bill \u2014 such as prohibiting Mr. Trump from using Pentagon money to fund the building of a border wall. Some progressives are upset that Mr. Trump will still have the ability to use this to fund the wall under his declared national emergency. \"The way it is right now, I will not vote for it,\" Sen. Patrick Leahy told Politico\u00a0earlier this month. \"The other 99 can vote for it.\" Ahead of the vote, some Republicans said they weren't entirely happy with the bill. \"I have some concerns,\" Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said on Wednesday, pointing to the huge spending increase. \"Caps are essentially gone forever,\" and he wondered, \"what is the long-term impact on the average person in our country?\" The budget caps, put in place in 2011 to control government spending will expire in 2021, and this deal exceeds the caps. Sen. John Kennedy, of Louisiana, said he would vote \"no\" because he's not comfortable with the spending increases. He supports raising defense spending and said in the short term, he welcomes the idea that it might bring \"a little peace to this place,\" though he added, \"I'm not much of a believer in peace at any cost.\" \"Everybody says they want to reduce spending, he noted, \"but it's like going to heaven. Everybody wants to go to heaven. Nobody's quite ready to make the trip. And that's where it is with reducing spending,\" he noted. \"And put me down as a 'no' dog.\"\u00a0 Sen. Rand Paul attempted to add an amendment that would cap annual spending at lower levels, although it reached the requisite 60 votes to be added to the bill. \"Today is the final nail in the coffin. The tea party is no more,\" Paul told Roll Call. \"The budget deal today allows unlimited borrowing for nearly two years ... Fiscal conservatives, those who remain, should be in mourning.\" Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham declared he's a yes vote for what amounts to a \"big win for the military.\" He scoffed at senators who'd hold the line on military spending without approving similar increases that Democrats want in non-defense sectors.\u00a0 \"What are your options? If you vote against it, then you should be in charge of negotiating the New Deal,\" he told reporters. \"The House Democratic caucus wants more spending for non-defense. If we increase defense spending, that dynamic is not going to change.\"\u00a0 In 2011, House Republicans refused to raise the debt ceiling without Congress addressing national debt, forcing President Obama to sign the Budget Control Act or risk a sequester. The act called for Congress to find $1 trillion in government spending cuts by the end of the year. Mick Mulvaney, now the chief of staff for Mr. Trump, was one of the Republican congressmen who blocked raising the debt limit, pushing Obama to sign the act into law. As Congress failed to adequately cut spending, sequestration was automatically triggered in 2013, with annual budget caps through 2021. However, Congress has repeatedly waived the caps since 2014. The new budget deal also waives the caps, and sets the budget through 2021 -- allowing the Budget Control Act to expire.

            "article_content": "United Nations -- A White House team has returned to the Middle East for a tour of five friendly nations aimed at garnering support for the administration's still-vague plan to end decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, along with Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt, met Jordan's King Abdullah in Amman on Wednesday.  The Trump administration's Iran negotiator Brian Hook, who also handles Mideast negotiations on behalf of the State Department, was also expected to be traveling with the team, making stops also in Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Morocco. \u00a0 Their trip comes a month after Kushner attended a summit in Bahrain at which a proposed $50 billion Palestinian investment plan for the next 10 years was announced. Administration officials have called the proposed cash infusion the economic half of their Mideast peace plan. But they've revealed very little thus far about the political aspects of their plan -- which will need to address the disputes that have thwarted other peace initiatives for more than half a century. Missing from the Bahrain discussion were two key delegations: the Israelis, who weren't invited, and the Palestinians, who boycotted the summit and have already rejected the Trump administration's peace effort as biased in favor of Israel.  At an open meeting of the Security Council last week on the Middle East, Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour said the Bahrain conference had failed to acknowledge the \"root causes of this conflict.\" Nonetheless, an administration official told CBS News the objective of this week's meetings in the region is \"to continue the momentum of the successful Bahrain workshop on the economic plan.\"  At the Security Council meeting, Greenblatt said the U.S. negotiating team had been \"clear and honest\" about the need for both an economic and political plan to bring peace to the region. \"There will be no economic prosperity without a political solution. But no political solution will succeed without a well-developed economic plan.\" While the administration has revealed little in the way of detail on that \"political solution,\" it's clear they intend to depart from the long-standing, internationally agreed parameters of the peace process. \"Let's stop kidding ourselves,\" Greenblatt told other Security Council nations, \"If a so-called international consensus had been able to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it would have done so decades ago. It didn't.\" The U.N. Security Council has long been involved in negotiations to establish two states. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, in her last address to the Council, implored members to heed the Trump administration's proposed peace plan. But the unveiling of that plan was stalled in the wake of the Trump administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the moving of the U.S. Embassy to the holy city. Both moves were hugely contentious, and condemned by the Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.\u00a0 Some analysts -- in Israel in particular -- believe Greenblatt \"gave a nod\" to East Jerusalem as a potential future Palestinian capital when he noted in his remarks last week that \"Jerusalem is a city of three world faiths,\" and that freedom to worship there must be protected. Two administration officials acknowledged to CBS News that his remark may have been a deliberate reference to the point.  In a wide-ranging interview with four news organizations including CBS News after his U.N. testimony, Greenblatt said that after the team's tour of the region, they would \"have a better sense of what our next steps are.\"\u00a0 In the interview, Greenblatt did lay out some more contours of the plan -- vague though they continue to be -- and how the administration will keep campaigning for it: \u2022 On the timing: Mr. Trump's envoy said: \"We have a decision to make - are we going to do it before the Israeli elections (in September) or after. Are we going to do it before they form a government or not. We haven't made that decision yet... We're protecting something extraordinarily delicate. We know that there's a lot of opposition to our effort, primarily from the Palestinian side. We are going to air it at a time that we think it has the best chance of success.\" \u2022 On push-back at the U.N.: Some Security Council members, including Germany, blasted the U.S. stance as hypocritical, suggesting that Washington was keen to see international laws enforced when it suited American interests -- such as demanding a firm response to Iran's actions in the Persian Gulf -- while ignoring Israel's breaches for building new Jewish homes on occupied Palestinian territory.  German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, directing his remarks at Greenblatt, said: \"For us international law is not an a la carte menu.\" \"I think that some of the Permanent Representatives misconstrued my remarks,\" Greenblatt said. \"I did not throw international law into the garbage. That was very clear. We don't think, on this particular conflict, international law is clear. If we just hide behind diplomatic niceties and ambiguous resolutions and diplomatic words that really mean nothing, we're not going to achieve peace.\" \u2022 On a two-state solution: \"We don't think you could boil it down to a three-word slogan, so we stay away from the term,\" Greenblatt said. \"We're well aware of what the Palestinian aspirations are. We're well aware of what the Israelis think that they can give. The hope is that it's interesting enough to both sides that they're willing to engage. I was interviewed last week on PBS and I said our plan does not contain a one-state solution.\" \u2022 On the 1967 borders: For decades, the goal of the U.N.-backed international peace process has been to establish two separate nations; Israel alongside a new, independent Palestinian state with borders reflecting those that were in place before 1967, when Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\u00a0 \"If that were achievable, I think we'd already have peace. It's not achievable. It's not a deal it seems that anyone has been able to achieve,\" he said. \"One of the biggest challenges we have is the security risk to Israel. That doesn't mean we don't care about the Palestinians. It doesn't mean we don't want Palestinians to be safe and secure.\" Greenblatt said the White House was hoping the international community would consider the new proposals, whatever they are, \"with an open mind, and not revert back to the talking points and explain why they have issues.\" He said the White House believed \"the criticism really needs to come from the Palestinians and the Israelis. It's not for America or the Europeans or anyone else to dictate how this conflict is resolved. We don't live there. Our lives aren't at risk there.\"  In the interview, Greenblatt conceded that his words may \"irritate\" some of America's allies, but insisted there was \"nothing that I said that in our view wasn't truthful, and I think that everything that I said is a necessary step to eventually airing the plan, and if there's traction, getting to results.\" CBSNews.com's Tucker Reals contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "President Trump at a campaign rally on Wednesday doubled down on his racist remarks about four progressive congresswomen  of color, casting them as an existential threat to modern American society and saying \"let them leave.\" \"These left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force of evil,\" Mr. Trump told his ardent supporters during a campaign rally in North Carolina on Wednesday night. \"They want to demolish our constitution, weaken our military (and) eliminate the values that built this magnificent county.\" As he took direct aim at Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a defiant Mr. Trump was buoyed by the raucous crowd, which chanted \"send her back!\"\u00a0 The racist chants some in the crowd directed at Omar, a Somali-American and one of two Muslim women in Congress, were reminiscent of Mr. Trump's own factually inaccurate tirade over the weekend against the Minnesota lawmaker and her colleagues Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.\u00a0 Mr. Trump on Sunday morning posted\u00a0a series of tweets\u00a0deriding \"'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen,\" alluding to Omar, Pressley, Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib. \"So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.\" The president claimed that the four Democratic congresswomen \"originally came\" from foreign countries but only Omar was born outside the U.S. Pressley, an African American, was born in Ohio. Ocasio-Cortez, of Puerto Rican heritage, was born in New York. Tlaib, the daughter of Palestinian immigrants, was born in Detroit. Omar, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in Somalia, a country she and her family fled from because of a civil war and ethnic strife. On Wednesday night, the president again singled out the four progressive lawmakers, accusing Omar of being a fringe legislator who holds anti-Semitic views, denigrates the military and minimizes the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He accused Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 who he referred to as \"Cortez\" because her double-barrelled surname takes \"too much time\" to say \u2014 of stating that Nazis are running\u00a0 detention centers for migrants near the U.S.-Mexico border.\u00a0 Along with joking that Pressley could be related to rock legend Elvis Presley, Mr. Trump had harsh words about Tlaib, the other Muslim woman serving in Congress. \"That's not somebody that loves our country,\" he said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's recent remarks have drawn scathing condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans. Like others in her party who accused the president of stoking racial animus, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called his comments \"xenophobic\" and \"racist.\" On Tuesday, after a bitter partisan brawl, House lawmakers approved a resolution to formally denounce Mr. Trump's recent tirade against four progressive congresswomen of color, with four Republicans joining Democrats to rebuke the president.   The campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina \u2014 one of several rallies Mr. Trump has held this year \u2014 also came after a long-shot effort to impeach him failed in the Democratic-led House.\u00a0 The Trump campaign and Republican National Committee are beefing up staff in North Carolina, which the Trump campaign recognizes is a key state for the president's reelection. The president won North Carolina by less than four points in 2016, and he'll likely face a tougher battle in 2020. Kathryn Watson contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming that aired Sunday, July 21, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now is the number three Republican in the House, Wyoming's Liz Cheney. Good morning to you.\u00a0 REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the vice president say, \"next time the president might say something.\" Why doesn't the president as a matter of principle say unequivocally that non-white Americans are just as American as anyone else? Why doesn't he put this to rest? REP. CHENEY: Well, I think you've heard him say that the chant was inappropriate. We've all said the chant was inappropriate. I think the news media-- MARGARET BRENNAN: No, he said they were patriotic-- REP. CHENEY: I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --very patriotic. REP. CHENEY: I think the news media really wants to make this about race. You just did it. This isn't about race. It's not about gender. It's not about religion. These members of the House of Representatives more, it's not just these four, it's also some of the candidates who are running\u00a0 for president on the Democratic side, fundamentally believe in policies that are dangerous for this nation. And as Republicans we are going to fight against those even if the mainstream media accuses us of racism when we do that. This is about their support for-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is \"send her back\"-- REP. CHENEY: It is absolutely-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --patriotic? REP. CHENEY: It is absolutely wrong it should not have happened. And we've all said it shouldn't have happened. I would really like to see the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And when the president says, \"go back\"-- REP. CHENEY: --media as focused. I would like to see the media as focused on the substance of what this wing of the Democratic Party is advocating because that is really dangerous for our country.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You understand-- REP. CHENEY: Socialism is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: the president-- REP. CHENEY: --dangerous for our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: --tweeted about this, this morning-- REP. CHENEY: I do. MARGARET BRENNAN: --right before we went to air. REP. CHENEY: I do. That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president is-- REP. CHENEY: It is- it is fundament-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --continuing this conversation REP. CHENEY: The president, this morning before we came on air, talked about the extent to which you know they love this nation. And I think that if you go back and you look at many of the things I've said you saw the vice president say some of that this morning as well, talking about the nation is \"garbage\" for example. But-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But those are policies. REP. CHENEY: I would-- I would, you know, again reiterate this election and these issues that we're talking about are fundamental to the future of this country. When you have members of Congress who are as anti-Semitic as- as Ilhan Omar has been, when you have members of Congress who are advocating the, you know, complete elimination of the use of all fossil fuels, all air travel, the elimination of private insurance, the imposition of socialism on this country, we're not going to stand for that. We're not going to stand for policies that take freedom away from the American people. That's what this fight is about. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, what you're talking about there are policy differences.\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: That's right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not what the president was tweeting about this morning.\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: Listen, I think it's fundamentally-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And when he said, \"I don't believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our country.\" I know you disagree with their policies and their politics, you just made that clear. But, there have been death threats against Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. REP. CHENEY: MARGARET-- MARGARET BRENNAN: In April, there was an arrest-- REP. CHENEY: --MARGARET, listen-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --because someone called-- REP. CHENEY: MARGARET-- \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --her office and said-- REP CHENEY: There is no question-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --asked if she-- REP. CHENEY: Listen-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and said he-- REP. CHENEY: --There are a lot of secure-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --would put a bullet in-- REP. CHENEY: Are you going to let me answer your question? MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I'm asking the question--\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: I- I- I got the question. MARGARET BRENNAN: --a bullet in her skull. REP. CHENEY: There are- there are- fundamentally, this is- this is a moment where we have to be very clear, and- and it's really important for us to focus on- and I know you guys don't want to, you don't want to focus on the fact that there are substantive differences, you also don't want to focus on. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, I-- REP. CHENEY: Wait, let me- I let you ask me the question. This is about-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not what the president is talking about. He's not--\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: --policy. And it is- this is- that is not true. The president-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --talking about policy. REP. CHENEY: --every single day talks about policy. Every single day-- MARGARET BRENNAN: \"Are they capable of loving our country\"-- REP. CHENEY: Every single day this president talks about the tremendous economic growth that we have seen since he's been in office, the tremendous job growth, the tremendous-- MARGARET BRENNAN: \"Capable of loving-- REP. CHENEY: decline in unemployment-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --our country\" has nothing to do-- REP. CHENEY: MARGARET. MARGARET BRENNAN: --with jobs-- REP.\u00a0 CHENEY: You are making-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you disagree with that sentiment? REP. CHENEY: --my point, you are making my point for me right now. We are focused on-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you agreeing with the president or disagreeing with him? Because I'm not clear. REP. CHENEY: The president has absolutely said that they should not have chanted \"Send her back.\" Our concern and our opposition to what these women are saying- and many other members of the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives- has to do with the fact that they are advocating policies that will destroy this nation and we will fight against it. And I think the news media, you included, ought to cover the substance and I think it is outrageous for you to say the president doesn't talk about substance. Every single day, you can look at the evidence, you can look at the fact that this nation is stronger than- than it has probably ever been. You can look at what the president's policies have done on economic growth, but you don't want to talk about that. So I do think that it would behoove you--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --We would love to talk about that, and the president has talked to us about that-- REP. CHENEY: You have every opportunity, every single day, you have an opportunity-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --the president this morning tweeted that they don't love their country.\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: You've made that point MARGARET, yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: The rest of the world is also watching this, though.\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: That's right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Canada's prime minister said the comments made were \"hurtful, wrong, completely unacceptable.\" Germany's chancellor said these sentiments are in opposition to her impressions about the U.S. and she expressed solidarity in her words \"with the attacked women.\" The prime minister of the U.K. issued a statement condemning this, of New Zealand. These aren't members of the media, these are world leaders. Should Americans find the comments from the president acceptable? REP. CHENEY: MARGARET, listen, I know you want to continue to talk about this as though it had to do with race. I know you want to continue to talk about it, as though it had-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You think all those world leaders-- REP. CHENEY: MARGARET, I just let you- I just let you-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --misunderstood everything? \u00a0 REP. CHENEY: Look I don't think the American people are going to look to foreign leaders to tell us who should lead the nation. They're not going to look to foreign leaders to tell us whether or not we should be a socialist country. Thank goodness we won't do that. We depend upon those people who are elected. And I think that when you see the- the Democratic members of Congress standing up and saying that they want to, you know, that- that we have concentration camps on our borders, that they want to provide free healthcare for illegal immigrants, that they want to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. REP.\u00a0 CHENEY: --end private health insurance, that they want to impose socialism on this country, they need to defend those policy positions and we are going to take every opportunity to make sure the American people, who are the ones that are going to make this choice come November 2020, recognize the fundamental choice that we're all facing. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to you on Iran but I just do want to point out that there are two black elected Republicans who said that this was racially insensitive. REP. CHENEY: MARGARET, we have many views--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And another Republican Mark Walker--\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: MARGARET.\u00a0 MARAGRET BRENNAN: --said it was painful. So--\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: MARGARET, we have all said that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --that's not the media REP. CHENEY: Excuse me, but you-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But, on Iran--\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: Listen, you just continue to sort of put these little points out there and then move on. And every time you do it you are making the point I'm making. As Republicans we are focused on substance. We are focused on policy and we will continue to do that no matter what the mainstream media attempts to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Unfortunately now we don't have time to talk about Iran, but thank you very much-- REP. CHENEY: Well you should have asked about Iran sooner because that's a policy issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: I would love to if the president tweets about it-- REP. CHENEY: Great. MARGARET BRENNAN: --we certainly will cause I know you-- REP. CHENEY: He has tweeted about Iran. MARGARET BRENNAN: --have raised questions about it. REP. CHENEY: Actually he's tweeted about Iran quite a bit. Be good to cover all the president's tweets. MARGARET BRENNAN: I would love to. REP. CHENEY: Great. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much-- REP. CHENEY: Thank you\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --but we have to go now to the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff--",

            "article_content": "President Trump, asked if he'll tell Russian President Vladimir Putin not to meddle in the 2020 election, told reporters Wednesday what he says to Putin is \"none of your business.\" Mr. Trump made the comments on his way to Japan for the G20 summit, where he'll meet with Putin and other world leaders. Mr. Trump continues to be criticized for his handling of relations with Russia, recently making headlines for telling ABC News he would probably take a look at information from foreign governments that could hurt his opponents. He'll be meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the G20 summit, and it's unclear how much of the content of that meeting will be shared. As he departed the White House for his trip to Asia Wednesday, Mr. Trump also expressed optimism about progress on a humanitarian border aid bill. \"We are moving along very nicely with a bipartisan bill in the Senate,\" he told reporters at the White House. He spoke with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi before he departed and said, \"I think that Nancy wants to get something done.\" However, the bill in the Senate differs from the House version, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been critical of the measure passed by the House Thursday, calling it a \"go-nowhere proposal filled with poison-pill riders which the president would veto.\" The president was also asked about a photo depicting the tragic death of a migrant father and his two-year-old daughter, who drowned trying to cross the Rio Grande this week. He said that if Congress \"fixed the laws,\" this wouldn't happen. And he noted that the river currents can be rough. If we had the right laws, he said, \"those people wouldn't be coming up...they wouldn't be trying\" to come to the U.S. In Japan, Mr. Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin, among other world leaders. The international trip comes amid escalating tensions with Iran and as a trade deal with China still has yet to come to fruition. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened the \"obliteration\" of parts of Iran if it attacks anything belonging to the U.S. Mr. Trump authorized new sanctions against Iran's supreme leader and a cyberattack on Iran after Iran shot down a U.S. drone last week. \"Iran's very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only shows that they do not understand reality,\" Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. \"Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.\" Mr. Trump arrives in Osaka, Japan, on Thursday night for the G20 summit and a host of sideline meetings Then on Saturday he flies to Seoul, South Korea, to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. He will return to D.C. on Sunday. Kathryn Watson and Arden Farhi contributed to this report.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Hong Kong \u2014 Demonstrators gathered here Monday outside the office of the city's leader, demanding that she resign due to the crisis over an unpopular extradition bill that has tested the durability of China's promises to respect the former British colony's quasi-autonomy.  The mostly young protesters blocked a street near the city's waterfront as they stood outside the office of Chief Executive Carrie Lam chanting calls for her to give up the proposed legislation.  Nearly 2 million Hong Kong residents, young and old, joined a march on Sunday that lasted late into the night to express their frustrations with Lam and the extradition bill, backed by Beijing. Many stayed on afterward.  Protesters blocked some downtown roads well into Monday morning, but gradually yielded to police requests to reopen roads, moving to areas near the city's government headquarters.  Later on Monday, the protest revived after Joshua Wong, a prominent activist leader, rallied the crowd after his release from prison.  The activists have rejected apologies from Lam for her handling of the legislation, which would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. She announced that work on the bill would be suspended after large protests last week, but the legislation has touched a nerve not easily soothed in a city anxious over the increasingly authoritarian Communist rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping.  \"If Carrie Lam does not respond to the demands by the protesters, people will come back and the struggle will continue,\" Lee Cheuk-yan, an activist and former legislator, said Monday.  The uproar over the extradition bill highlights worries that the former British colony is losing the special autonomous status China promised it when it took control in 1997.  On June 9, as many as 1 million people demonstrated to express their concern over Hong Kong's relations with mainland China.  The scenes are similar to those in 2014, when protesters camped for weeks in the streets to protest rules that prevented the direct election of the city's chief executive.  Wong, who was imprisoned for his role in the 2014 demonstrations and sit-ins, dubbed the \"Umbrella Movement,\" was released from prison on Monday after serving half of a two-month sentence on a contempt charge. He soon swapped his white shirt for one that was black - the color of this year's protests \u2014  and joined the fray.  \"After the end of the Umbrella Movement we claimed we would be back. Finally five years later we did it,\" Wong said.  \"It's lucky that Beijing and Carrie Lam transformed a whole generation of youngsters from normal citizens to dissidents. That's the price that Beijing must pay,\" Wong said.  Wong called in a tweet for Lam to resign and for a halt to \"all political persecutions.\"  One concern over the extradition bill is that it might be used to send critics of Communist Party rule to the mainland to face vague political charges, possible torture and unfair trials.  It's seen as one of many steps chipping away at Hong Kong's freedoms and legal autonomy.  Lam insists the legislation is needed for Hong Kong to uphold justice, meet its international obligations and not become a magnet for fugitives. It would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include Taiwan, Macau and mainland China.  So far, China has been excluded from Hong Kong's extradition agreements because of concerns over the judicial independence of its courts and its human rights record.  The vast majority of Hong Kong residents fled persecution, political chaos or famine in the Chinese mainland. They value stability and but also cherish freedoms of dissent and legal protections not allowed Chinese living across the border.  Many Hong Kong residents also were angered over the police use of tear gas, rubber bullets and other forceful measures as demonstrators broke through barricades outside the city government's headquarters during demonstrations on Wednesday, and over Lam's decision to call the clashes a riot. That worsens the potential legal consequences for those involved.  The protesters have mainly focused their ire toward Lam, who has little choice but to carry through dictates issued by Beijing. She has sidestepped questions over whether she should quit and also defended how the police dealt with last week's clashes.  Many here believe Hong Kong's legal autonomy has been significantly diminished despite Beijing's insistence that it is still honoring its promise, dubbed \"one country, two systems,\" that the territory can retain its own social, legal and political system for 50 years after the handover from Britain in 1997.  Prosecutions of activists, detentions without trial of five Hong Kong book publishers and the illegal seizure in Hong Kong by mainland agents of at least one mainland businessman are among moves in recent years that have unnerved many in the city of 7 million.

            "article_content": "The Trump name graces apartment towers, hotels and golf courses. Now it is the namesake of a tiny Israeli settlement in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet convened in this hamlet Sunday to inaugurate a new settlement named after Donald Trump in a gesture of appreciation for the U.S. president's recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the territory. The settlement isn't exactly new. Currently known as Bruchim, it is over 30 years old and has a population of 10 people. Israel is hoping the rebranded \"Ramat Trump,\" Hebrew for \"Trump Heights,\" will encourage a wave of residents to vastly expand it. \"It's absolutely beautiful,\" said U.S. Ambassador David Friedman, who attended Sunday's ceremony. Noting that Mr. Trump celebrated his birthday Friday, he said: \"I can't think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday present.\" Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in 1981. Most of the international community considers the move illegal under international law. But during a visit to Washington by Netanyahu in March, just weeks before Israeli elections, Mr. Trump signed an executive order recognizing the strategic mountainous plateau as Israeli territory. The decision, the latest in a series of diplomatic moves benefiting Israel, was widely applauded in Israel. \"Few things are more important to the security of the state of Israel than permanent sovereignty over the Golan Heights,\" Friedman said. \"It is simply obvious, it is indisputable and beyond any reasonable debate.\" After the Cabinet decision, Netanyahu and Friedman unveiled a sign trimmed in gold with the name \"Trump Heights\" and adorned with U.S. and Israeli flags. the president retweeted photos Friedman posted of the event and thanked Netanyahu \"and the State of Israel for this great honor!\" Thank you PM @Netanyahu and the State of Israel for this great honor!\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 https://t.co/OUcf6s98UX Addressing the ceremony, Netanyahu called Mr. Trump a \"great friend\" of Israel and described the Golan, which overlooks northern Israel, as an important strategic asset. \"The Golan Heights was and will always be an inseparable part of our country and homeland,\" he said. Developing Ramat Trump will not be easy. Ringed by high yellow grass and land mines, it is roughly 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Syrian border and a half hour drive from the nearest Israeli town, Kiryat Shmona, a community of about 20,000 people near the Lebanese border. According to Israeli figures, almost 50,000 people live in the Golan, including about 22,000 Jewish Israelis and nearly 25,000 Arab Druze residents. While Israel has encouraged and promoted settlement in the Golan, its remote location, several hours from the economic center of Tel Aviv, has been an obstacle. The area is home to small agriculture and tourism sectors but otherwise has little industry. The eight-year Syrian civil war, which at times has resulted in spillover fire into the Golan, also could present an obstacle to luring new residents. Zvi Hauser, an opposition lawmaker who formerly served as Netanyahu's Cabinet secretary, called Sunday's ceremony a cheap PR stunt. \"There's no funding, no planning, no location, and there's no real binding decision,\" he said. Ramat Trump joins a handful of Israeli places named after American presidents, including a village for Harry S. Truman, who first recognized the Jewish state, and George W. Bush Plaza, a square the size of a modest living room in central Jerusalem.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the full interview with British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt that aired Sunday, June 2, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump travels to London tonight, and he will be greeted by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt who is also vying for leadership of the country's Conservative Party and ultimately the title of prime minister. He joins us from London. Welcome to FACE THE NATION. We know that the president has given some interviews ahead of his arrival in the U.K. and he said of Boris Johnson, one of your rivals, \"He would do a very good job. He would be excellent.\" He's made other comments. Should the president be weighing in on your election? U.K. FOREIGN SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT: Well, we've gotten to know the president a bit over the last few years. Good morning, Margaret, by the way, and we're- we're quite used to the fact that he does the unexpected thing, and it's not going to affect the warmth of the welcome that we give him because Britain and America are two of the greatest friends you find anywhere on the planet. And we want to celebrate the fact that 75 years ago we had more than a million U.S. troops stationed in the U.K. fighting for our freedom. Over 400,000 Americans lost their lives in the second world war, and no two countries have done more to stand together for the values that you and I and everyone watching this show believes in, freedom, democracy, the rule of law, all those things that really, really matter and we're just delighted that President Trump is coming here so that we can celebrate that together. MARGARET BRENNAN: The special relationship, indeed. In that interview, the president also said he likes you too. And he said that some candidates had asked for his endorsement-- FOREIGN SECRETARY HUNT: I'll take the compliments where I can get them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you ask him for an endorsement? FOREIGN SECRETARY HUNT: No, I have never asked, and you know, I think my job is to represent the British government. And I think that the worst thing anyone could imagine is a foreign secretary talking about the future leadership of the country when he's there to represent the current government and the current prime minister. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I want to ask you about your work in that, but I have to ask you another uncomfortable question, and that's even worse because it's about the royals. The president had made some comment about Meghan Markle referring to her as \"nasty\" for comments she made about him back in 2016. \u00a0 \u00a0Is any of this going to disrupt the welcome? FOREIGN SECRETARY HUNT: I don't think it's going to disrupt the welcome at all because I think the other thing we've learned from the president is that you know regularly we have to agree to disagree, and there's a whole list of things that we don't agree with the administration on, but it doesn't affect the fact that we have the most important partnership that there is in the world for freedom, democracy, the rule of law the things, that really matter, and that's what we're celebrating. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about one of the things that the U.K. and the U.S. have had some disagreement on and that is the threat posed by Iran. The U.K. had wanted the U.S. to stay part of that international deal to freeze Iran's nuclear program. Obviously the president did not. Do you think that that decision and labeling the IRGC a terrorist group has contributed to the rising tension in the Middle East? FOREIGN SECRETARY HUNT: Well, we've never disagreed with the U.S. about the threat posed by Iran, and we see the intelligence that the U.S. sees. We have a very close intelligence sharing relationship, and we see the destabilization that's happening in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon- across the Middle East, the Yemen as well. And so we completely agree that something has to be done to stop that because this is one of the most fragile regions on the planet. But we do want to make sure that Iran doesn't go nuclear. And we think that if Iran acquired nuclear weapons other countries in the region would be likely to follow suit. And that could be very, very dangerous. And so- and we have a very honest discussion that's why we signed up with the previous administration to the Iran nuclear deal. And we want to make sure that whatever happens as tensions rise, as they seem to be rising at the moment, we don't lose one of the big achievements of the last few years which is that Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon at the moment. Just think how much worse it would be today if we were having to confront the possibility of an Iran with nuclear weapons. We don't want that to change. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Ambassador Bolton has said they will bring evidence against Iran and this threat to the United Nations. I know you just met with him. Is the U.K. supporting the U.S. campaign to put more pressure on Iran? FOREIGN SECRETARY HUNT: We absolutely recognize we need to put more pressure on Iran. And we agree that the status quo, even with the lack of nuclear weapons in Iran, the status quo is not sustainable when you have incredibly tense situations because of the activities of Hezbollah in Lebanon attacking Israel, because of some of what the Houthis have been doing to Saudi Arabia, because of the threats to American interests in Iraq. These are things that are not stable, they're not acceptable. And if we're going to find an accommodation both the U.S., both Ambassador Bolton, Mike Pompeo who I meet regularly, and the president, we all see the end game in this and sitting around the table and having talks with Iran, and it's a question of creating the context where those talks can be successful. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. has filed an extradition request with your government to have Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, here in the United States to face justice. We know U.N. officials raised concerns about human rights violations if he's sent here. Does your government take that seriously? FOREIGN SECRETARY HUNT: Well, we have absolute confidence in the judicial processes in the U.S. The U.S. and the U.K. are the two countries that do more to stand up for the rule of law across the world. We- both our Constitution strongly respect the independence of the judiciary. But Julian Assange is someone who is alleged to have committed some very serious crimes, alleged to have led to people's deaths. And so it is absolutely right that he faces justice and he has no more reason to escape justice than anyone else who is alleged to have committed crimes. So I think what's happened is the right thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: So if you do become prime minister you would not stand in the way of an extradition of Assange to the United States? FOREIGN SECRETARY HUNT: Well we would have to follow our own legal processes just as the U.S. has to follow its own legal processes. But do I think- would I want to stand in the way of Julian Assange facing justice? No I would not. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump has said one of the things he does want to speak to your current Prime Minister Theresa May about is the threat posed by China and specifically this company Huawei, which I know the U.K. has not made a decision as yet as to whether this firm would be allowed to help build out your internet, the 5G network. But Secretary Pompeo has said if you don't take this seriously the U.S. might not be able to share intelligence anymore with the United Kingdom. Why hasn't the U.K. agreed to what the U.S. is asking? FOREIGN SECRETARY HUNT: Well we are taking it very seriously. We have some of the best cyber security capability in the world and we'd never take a decision that affected our intelligence sharing capability with the United States. And we have to look at the technical issues which are around whether buying products from a specific country could be a backdoor to espionage. And we're looking at those very carefully but we also have to look at the strategic issue which is that China's being very open. They've said they want to have a- an 80 percent market share of telecoms technology and in other areas like artificial intelligence, they want a 90 percent market share by 2025. And we have to ask as Western countries whether it's wise to allow one country to have such a commanding monopoly in the technologies that we're all of us going to be depending on. So those are very, very important discussions that we- we continue to have. MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you may be considering that. One of the things that the president has also said he wants to bring up with Prime Minister May is it seems his continued concern that the U.K. may have in some way or another worked with the CIA or FBI regarding what he calls the Russian hoax. He made these comments just last week. How does your government respond to this allegation? I know the GCHQ British intelligence has previously denied it but the president still suspects it. FOREIGN SECRETARY HUNT: Well you know we have a very close intelligence sharing relationship and our default is always to say yes to our closest ally. If- if- if America asks us to do things, you guys are doing so much to defend Europe and defend freedom across the world. You know we would want to be cooperative but we would always do so within due process and we would never do anything improper and- and we don't have any secrets. So we're happy to discuss these things but one of the things that I'll certainly be discussing with the president and Secretary of State Pompeo is our concern about the growing strategy we seem to be seeing from Russia to interfere in democratic processes in free countries. And in doing so, seeking to discredit or destabilize democracies. And a country that I think is the greatest concern in this respect is Ukraine which is a very brave and very young and very fragile democracy. They are subject to enormous amounts of cyber attacks from Russia and we believe and I know that Mike Pompeo believes that we need to find a way of making an international red line so that countries know it is just not acceptable to try and interfere in the electoral processes of other countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do I understand you saying there that the U.K. has not yet been asked by the U.S. for help in the probe the attorney general in this country is carrying out? But you continue to deny that there was any work with the CIA or FBI on the so-called Russian hoax? FOREIGN SECRETARY HUNT: Margaret you'll forgive me if I- I talk in generalities but we obviously don't talk in the media about specific requests over intelligence sharing, except to say what I've just said, which is that we would always try and work closely and helpfully with our- our greatest ally because we recognize the important role you play in the world, and we would never of course do anything improper or seek to interfere with another country's electoral processes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And lastly, President Trump talks a lot about a possible free trade deal with the U.K. Speaker Pelosi was recently in the area and said there is no way it would pass the U.S. Congress if, as a result of Brexit, there was a hard border put back in Ireland splitting the republic from the north. Is that something you could say that as Prime Minister you would prevent from happening? FOREIGN SECRETARY HUNT: Well, I think I can put Speaker Pelosi's mind to rest at this because no U.K. government, no U.K. Prime Minister is ever going to be responsible for putting up a hard border on the island of Ireland because the- the peace process is every bit as important to the U.K. as it is to the Republic of Ireland. I mean, I grew up in the 1980s when you know we had bombs going off in Harrods and in Hyde Park and in Manchester. We suffered enormously from the Troubles as did people on both sides of the border in Ireland. And so we are absolutely committed from every fiber of our bodies to making sure that that peace process, a big achievement of John Major and Tony Blair, is preserved and protected. MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright, Mr. Foreign Secretary. Good luck with your busy visit. Thank you for joining us.",

            "article_content": "Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy denounced congressional Democrats for their myriad of investigations into President Trump and his administration, accusing them of being more interested in issuing subpoenas than offering legislative solutions.\u00a0 \"This is a time that the country wants to move forward. We want to move forward. We've got health care, we've got trade, we've got a crisis on our border. The Democrats are more interested in subpoenas than solutions,\" McCarthy said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\u00a0 Joining other Republicans in Congress, the veteran California lawmaker criticized the decision by the Senate Intelligence Committee to subpoena the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. The unexpected move by the Republican-controlled panel, considered one of the last bastions of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill, has splintered McCarthy's caucus, with some Republicans defending the committee's work and others accusing it of capitulating to the political goals of Democrats. \u00a0 McCarthy said a second round of congressional testimony by Trump Jr. would not change the \"outcome\" of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation \u2014 which concluded in March. \"Donald Trump Jr. has already testified for more than 27 hours,\" he said. \"If you want to bring him back in because something [Michael] Cohen has said when he is in jail for lying and talking about a meeting he wasn't even in? No, I don't think that's right.\" The minority leader said congressional Democrats would not be able to replicate Mueller's nearly two-year probe \u2014 which he alleged found \"no collusion\" and \"no obstruction.\" While Mueller did not establish the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government during the 2016 election, Mueller did not reach a decision in his obstruction of justice probe, which analyzed more than 10 instances in which Mr. Trump tried to impede the investigation.\u00a0 Although he said \"it's time to move on,\" McCarthy indicated he supported a probe into the origins of the Russia investigation, which Mr. Trump and his allies have constantly called for. He said it's \"appropriate\" for Attorney General William Barr to look into it.\u00a0 \"Was there obstruction? No. Was there collusion? No. But why did we even get to this point? Why did the dossier get to that point? What were the communications? You've got an IG report coming in?\" McCarthy said. \"That's going to be very important, but you never want America to have to live through this again.\" \"You don't want to have a president on any side of the aisle have to go through what we just went through again,\" he added.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "London --\u00a0The former President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, sharply criticized the country's current president on Thursday for stripping WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange of asylum status and allowing him to be arrested by U.K. police. \"The greatest traitor in Ecuadorian and Latin American history, Len\u00edn Moreno, allowed the British police to enter our embassy in London to arrest Assange,\" Correa tweeted. \"Moreno is a corrupt man, but what he has done is a crime that humanity will never forget,\" the former leader said. Assange had been living in Ecuador's embassy in London since he was granted asylum by Correa in 2012. The greatest traitor in Ecuadorian and Latin American history, Lenin Moreno, allowed the British police to enter our embassy in London to arrest Assange.Moreno is a corrupt man, but what he has done is a crime that humanity will never forget. https://t.co/XhT51MA6c6 \"Len\u00edn   Moreno was Correa's candidate,\" Richard Lapper, Associate Fellow at Chatham House's U.S. and the Americas Programme, told CBS News of the now-rivals. The left-wing leader was unable to run in Ecuador's 2017 elections because of the country's term limits, so he campaigned for Moreno, who was his one-time vice president. \"Correa expected Moreno to follow very similar policies to him. That hasn't happened. Len\u00edn   Moreno has pursued a more social democratic, more centrist political line,\" Lapper said. As tensions grew in Ecuador between Correa and Moreno supporters over the shift, a large trove of hacked documents, dubbed the \"INA Papers,\" was leaked on the internet. It included material belonging to Moreno which some people believe shows he profited from corrupt business dealings. WikiLeaks tweeted a link to the papers, but denied having anything to do with their publication, the Daily Beast reported. On Thursday, Correa tweeted: \"Julian Assange was expelled from the Ecuadorian Embassy for exposing Pres. Lenin Moreno's corruption in the #INAPapers.\" His tweet included bank details that he alleged were a secret account used by Moreno for money laundering.

Granting or withdrawing asylum is a sovereign right of the Ecuadorian state, according to international law,\" Moreno said in the prerecorded message.

            "article_content": "\"Some would call it a purge. I would call it turnover,\" said Indiana Senator Todd Young in response to the recent shake-up that saw Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation Sunday evening, as well as the departure of the other high-ranking officials on Monday. \"This is one agency that has been absolutely strained over the last few years on account of the crisis -- and I believe it is a crisis we have at the southern border,\" Young told CBS News' chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on this week's episode of \"The Takeout.\" \"Kirstjen Nielsen, I think personally has done an exceptional job in trying to work with Congress and take her case not just to the American people but to the courts on behalf of the President.\" Young, who was elected to the Senate in 2016, previously served three terms in the House. He currently sits as the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. With the 2020 election cycle gearing up, Young remained hopeful about the possibility of holding the 22 Republicans seats that will be up for grabs. \"I believe we are [going to hold our seats],\" said Young, who joined Garrett at The Dubliner on Capitol Hill. \"It's one thing to have strong candidates, it's another thing to have strong candidates who have a real record of accomplishments to run on.\" Democratic Sen. Doug Jones' seat in Alabama was one seat Young said Republicans are targeting, and said GOP Senate candidates would be running on a record of tax reform, regulatory reform, and the confirmation of judges. He conceded that President Trump's trade war with China is making him nervous. \"I have my own anxieties with respect to the impact that this tit-for-tat tariff war will have on our farmers, on our manufacturers, and on others,\" Young said. But Young credits the Trump administration for addressing trade disagreements between the U.S. and China, specifically mentioning intellectual property theft. He feels that intellectual property theft and trade should be handled by the federal government as a national security issue. \"I would come up with a written plan, actually much like we do for the national security strategy, about exactly how we're going to handle issues like this,\" Young said.

            "article_content": "The House Judiciary Committee voted to\u00a0authorize subpoenas for special counsel Robert Mueller's full report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and any ties between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. The resolution passed Wednesday morning 24-17 on a party-line vote, with Democrats voting in the majority. The committee will also subpoena all underlying documents related to Mueller's findings. After the vote, House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, told reporters the subpoena would not go out immediately. \"We are going to work with the attorney general for a short period of time, in the hopes that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials,\" he said. \"In very short order we'll issue the subpoenas if that doesn't work out.\" If the Justice Department does not release the grand jury material, Nadler will ask a judge to release it. He also called upon Attorney General William Barr to testify before the May 2 date Barr has proposed.\u00a0 In his opening statement, Nadler laid out the legal precedent for the claim on the documents, looking to the Watergate investigation into President Richard Nixon, the Starr Report into President Bill Clinton, and the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails.\u00a0 Ranking Member Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, countered that asking Barr to release grand jury materials is illegal. He also accused the majority Democrats of trying to paint a picture of innuendo before the full report is released, and he said that the proper thing to do would be to see what Barr releases and then ask for more material if that's insufficient. Republican members on the committee also claimed the resolution was a continuing effort to undermine the Trump presidency, with some claiming Democrats were pursuing the subpoenas as an attack on the president.\u00a0 \"As much as Democrats may hate the president, I would hope you love America more,\" said Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck. He said that \"if love trumps hate,\" Democrats should afford the attorney general enough time to properly release the findings.\u00a0 Meanwhile, as Democrats continue to push for transparency, President Trump pushed back, calling out Nadler for opposing the release of independent counsel Ken Starr's report on the investigation of former President Clinton. \"With the NO COLLUSION Mueller Report, which the Dems hate, he wants it all. NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY THEM!\" tweeted Mr. Trump on Tuesday.\u00a0 In 1998, Rep.Jerry Nadler strongly opposed the release of the Starr Report on Bill Clinton. No information whatsoever would or could be legally released. But with the NO COLLUSION Mueller Report, which the Dems hate, he wants it all. NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY THEM! @foxandfriends Committee spokesman Daniel Schwarz said in a statement on Tuesday that the debate in 1998 \"was not about Congress receiving evidence\" but rather about \"what type of material from the underlying evidence in the Starr report should be made public.\" \"Our expectation is that Attorney General Barr will be as forthcoming now as Mr. Starr was in 1998,\" added Schwarz, saying Barr \"should provide the full Mueller report to Congress, with the underlying materials, at which point we will be in a better position to understand what Special Counsel Mueller uncovered during his investigation.\"\u00a0 The House already overwhelmingly voted 420-0 on a non-binding resolution to release the full Mueller report, but Sen. Lindsey Graham blocked a vote on the resolution in the Senate. As a result of the resolution, Nadler's committee will also issue subpoenas for a variety of Trump associates. They include former White House Counsel Donald McGahn, former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, former White House communications director Hope Hicks, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and former White House Counsel chief of staff Ann Donaldson. They are being subpoenaed as part of the Judiciary Committee's separate investigation into possible threats to the rule of law by the president. \"Because we may have to go to court to obtain the complete text of the special counsel's report, and because the president may attempt to invoke executive privilege to withhold that evidence from us, it is imperative that the Committee take possession of these documents, and others, without delay,\" explained Nadler.\u00a0 The Department of Justice declined to comment about the House vote authorizing the subpoenas. Rebecca Kaplan and Clare Hymes contributed to this report.\u00a0 Speaking before Wednesday's vote, Nadler said in his opening remarks that on multiple occasions, he asked Barr \"to work with us to go to the court and obtain access to materials.\" Nadler claimed however that Barr has \"so far refused.\" \"I will give him time to change his mind.\u00a0 But if we cannot reach an accommodation, then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials. And if the Department still refuses, then it should be up to a judge\u2014not the president or his political appointee\u2014to decide whether or not it is appropriate for the Committee to review the complete record,\" said Nadler. Ranking Member Rep. Doug Collins, R-Georgia, meanwhile slammed the committee's ongoing probe of the president and investigation, saying time would best be spent on issues like the crisis on the Southern border. Collins said the asks for further documents was \"reckless, irresponsible and disingenuous.\" \"What's the rush? Spring break probably, we don't want to wait until May,\" Collins suggested of Nadler's calls for subpoenas as Barr has vowed to testify before lawmakers in early May. He claimed Democrats were simply calling for the subpoenas of documents to make headlines after Mueller didn't make a determination as to whether Mr. Trump committed obstruction of justice.\u00a0 \"This is great political theater,\" he added, arguing that asking Barr to release any grand jury materials was illegal, citing potential national security issues.\u00a0 GOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado echoed Collins, saying the public release could \"compromise intelligence sources and methods,\" and he noted that Barr had previously expressed concerns about this to the committee.\u00a0 \"As much as Democrats may hate the president, I would hope you love America more,\" said Buck. He said that \"if love trumps hate\" Democrats should afford the attorney general enough time to properly release the findings.\u00a0 Rep. John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, meanwhile urged that Mueller also be subpoenaed, saying the committee should let Mueller speak about \"whether or not he thinks the report he created should be disclosed without considerations of redactions of classified information.\"\u00a0 Fellow Texan Louie Gohmert, also a Republican, blasted Democrats, claiming they were the ones who had colluded with the Russian government. He called the ongoing probe an \"outrageous assault on the office of the president, even after the truth has come out.\" \"It's time to go back and clean up the mess that's been made,\" added Gohmert.\u00a0 Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida agreed with Gohmert, saying Democrats are in denial over Muller's report, saying the report's initial release is the the \"death rattle of the Democrats' Russian collusion lie.\" He said they're going through the \"stages of grief\" in real time over Mueller's less-than-fruitful findings into obstruction of justice and collusion.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "A suspect was arrested in a shooting that left three people dead and five wounded on a tram in the Netherlands\u00a0on Monday morning in what authorities said may have been a terror attack. The ensuing manhunt convulsed the Dutch city of Utrecht. Dutch Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus said the attacker \u2014 identified as Turkish-born Gokmen Tanis, 37 \u2014 \"was known\" to justice authorities and had a criminal record, but would not elaborate. \"If it had terror motives, that is being investigated. But it was very serious. The world shares our grief,\" Prime Minister Mark Rutte said, adding that some of the wounded \"are still in critical condition.\" In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on television the country's intelligence agency was investigating whether the attack was terrorism or personal, according to the Reuters news agency. The country's official Anadolu news agency had said the suspect's relatives believed he shot at someone close to the family due to \"family issues.\" Grapperhaus  warned against early speculation about motives, telling the Associated Press \"it is important that now the independent investigation will thoroughly go through\" the evidence. Tanis' father, Mehmet Tanis, who lives in Turkey's central Kayseri province, told the private Demiroren news agency that he hadn't spoken to his son in 11 years, saying \"if he did it, he should pay the penalty.\" The identities of the shooting victims were not immediately released. Grapperhaus would not say if any were known to the gunman. Monday's attack came three days after 50 people were killed when an immigrant-hating white supremacist opened fire at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Friday prayers. There was no immediate indication of any link between the two events. Dutch authorities reduced the threat level in the city back to four out of five following the arrest, which came after a manhunt involving heavily armed officers with dogs. During the hunt, police released a photo of a bearded Tanis aboard a tram in a blue hooded top. \"We cannot exclude, even stronger, we assume a terror motive. Likely there is one attacker, but there could be more,\" Utrecht Mayor Jan van Zanen said as police searched for the suspect. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Dutch military police tightened security at airports and key buildings in the country, and Rutte declared: \"If it is a terror attack, then we have only one answer: Our nation, democracy, must be stronger that fanaticism and violence.\" The shooting took place at a busy intersection in a residential neighborhood. Police erected a white tent over an area where a body appeared to be lying next to the tram. Anti-terror officers gathered at one point in front of an apartment building close to the scene. However, the suspect was later arrested at another location in the city. Political parties halted campaigning ahead of provincial elections scheduled for Wednesday that will also determine the makeup of Parliament's upper house. In neighboring Germany, police said they stepped up surveillance of the Dutch border, watching not only major highways but also minor crossings and train routes. German authorities said they were initially told to look out for a red Renault Clio compact car but were later informed it had been found abandoned in Utrecht.",

            "article_content": "The Israeli military said Friday it had begun airstrikes in the Gaza Strip in response to a rocket attack on Tel Aviv \u2014  which was the first time the city, some 50 miles north of Gaza, was targeted by rocket fire since a\u00a02014 war against Gaza militants. In a statement early Friday, the army said it was targeting \"terror sites.\" It provided no further details. The attacks were taking place in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, about 15 miles south of Gaza City. The warplanes could be heard flying overhead in Gaza City, where smoke from the explosions could be seen about 15 miles away from some of the strikes. Palestinian media said a Hamas naval base had been targeted. Israeli warplanes could be heard roaring through the skies above Gaza City. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Minutes later, the Israeli military reported air raid sirens in southern Israel. It said it had identified a launch attempt out of Gaza, but the rocket misfired and landed inside Palestinian territory. Earlier, in Tel Aviv, air raid sirens were heard wailing after rockets were launched from Gaza. \"No interceptions were made by aerial defense systems. No damage or injuries were reported,\" military officials said. CBS News has confirmed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is also Israel's defense minister, is holding an urgent security meeting with his military chief and other senior advisers in wake of the rocket launches. In Gaza, there was no immediate claim of responsibility. Gaza is controlled by Hamas, an Islamic militant group that seeks Israel's destruction. The territory is home to other militant groups, including Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed armed organization that also has a formidable rocket arsenal. \"The Hamas organization is the main organization in the Strip,\" chief military spokesman Brigadier-General Ronen Manelis told Israel Radio, according to the Reuters news agency. \"It is responsible for what happens within the Strip and what emanates from it.\" A post on social media apparently showed two rockets streaking through the night sky above Tel Aviv. Rocket alert sirens triggered in Tel Aviv and in surrounding central towns pic.twitter.com/s8BWxImwW6 Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai said he had ordered the city to open public air raid shelters as a protective measure. But he said there were no special instructions and encouraged residents to stick to their daily routines. \"Continue life as usual,\" he told Channel 10 TV. \"Be calm, but be alert.\" In an unusual step that indicated Hamas was attempting to prevent further escalation, the Hamas Interior Ministry said the rocket fire went \"against the national consensus\" and promised to take action against the perpetrators. Earlier this week, Israel struck Hamas targets in Gaza in response to rocket fire on southern Israel, near the border. Late Thursday, local media said that Egyptian mediators left the territory. In addition to Hamas, Gaza is home to other militant groups. They include Salafists inspired by the Islamic State group, as well as Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed armed organization that also possesses a formidable rocket arsenal. The Islamic Jihad also denied involvement in Thursday's attack. Earlier this week, Netanyahu issued a warning to Hamas, rejecting suggestions that Israel would be reluctant to take tough action in Gaza ahead of national elections next month. \"I suggest to Hamas, don't count on it,\" he told his Cabinet. \"We will do anything necessary to restore security and quiet to the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip and to the south in general.\"",

Fair Haven, a town of about 2,500 along the border with New York just west of Rutland, does not have an actual mayor. Town Manager Joseph Gunter says the honorary pet mayor idea was conceived as a fundraiser for a playground, but it turned into a civics lesson for kids. According to CBS affiliate WCAX-3, students on election day took to the polls with their parents to pick from a packed race of 16 candidates ranging from cats to dogs. Lincoln secured the office by a razor-thin margin of 3 votes.\u00a0 \"What I'm hoping is they took away a little sense of civic pride, you know, taking part in the community, going down to the voting places on voting day. I hope that they got excited about it went down and took part,\" Gunter told WCAX. Lincoln's owner Christopher Stapleton told the station that he hoped to see children getting involved in voting with their parents on a regular basis.\u00a0 On the way out of the offices, the honorary mayor defecated on the floor \u2014 leaving clean-up to the police chief and other attendees.",

            "article_content": "Columbia, S.C. \u2014 Democrat Kamala Harris represents California in the Senate, but her inaugural campaign swing through South Carolina over the weekend sent a clear signal that she sees the Palmetto State as the gateway to winning her party's nomination for president.  With its prime spot in the 2020 calendar and its high concentration of African American voters, the South Carolina primary could provide a launching pad for Democratic presidential hopefuls. And Harris' \"truth and justice\" campaign pitch seemed tailormade for competing in the state, which is scheduled to hold its primary on Feb. 29, 2020. Over the course of two town halls in North Charleston and Columbia \u2014 which book-ended stops through small businesses owned by black women, lunch at Rodney Scott's BBQ and a visit to Emanuel AME, the historically black church where nine worshipers were gunned down in 2015 \u2014 Harris advocated for changes to the criminal justice and education systems and the nation's gun laws, while touting bail reform legislation and an anti-lynching bill she co-authored in the Senate. She recounted how her immigrant parents \u2014 her father from Jamaica and her mother from India \u2014 had met while both were activists during the civil rights movement.  \"In America today, a mother or father has to sit down with their 12-year-old son and talk to him about how he may be arrested, or may be shot because of the color of his skin,\" Harris said at a town hall Friday evening attended by 1,000 people at Royal Family Life Center in North Charleston. \"That is not justice.\" \"Putting money in public education is smarter than putting money in mass incarceration,\" Harris said Saturday afternoon at the second town hall, held at the Health and Wellness Center at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia. \"We pretend to be a society that cares about education, but not so much the education of other people's children.\"  Harris frequently referenced her experience as a prosecutor to explain her approach to systemic reforms on matters of race and inequality. But that same experience also presents liabilities for Harris in the Democratic primary, with her record as district attorney in San Francisco and as attorney general of California already coming under scrutiny and attacks from some progressives. Harris touted a re-entry program designed to reduce recidivism known as \"Back on Track\" from her time as district attorney. \"I tried to explain to them the concept of redemption ... Isn't it a sign of a civil society that you allow people to earn your way back?\" she recalled of the 2005 initiative. She referenced her push for anti-bias training for police officers, California's \"Open Justice\" data sharing program and her work in the Senate with Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky to reform the bail system they view as discriminatory. But critics argue her record of action on criminal justice is mixed and at times at odds with the cause of social justice and anti-discrimination. As attorney general from 2011 to 2017, Harris declined to support a measure that would have required her office to independently investigate shootings by police officers, and didn't weigh in on a ballot initiative to reduce low-level criminal sentences. She defended the death penalty in her role as the state's top law enforcement officer, even though she personally opposed it. And she established a strict anti-truancy program that was seen as punishing parents. Harris has defended her positions by referencing a \"tough on crime\" mentality of the time, arguing she aimed to play a role in reform from the inside instead of from the outside.\u00a0 \"For too long, we have been offered a false choice \u2014 either you're soft on crime or tough on crime \u2014 instead of asking, 'Are we smart on crime?'\" she said in Columbia.  At a CNN town hall in Iowa in January, Harris was asked how she reconciles her \"contradictory past.\" The senator said, in part, that \"there are some people who just believe that prosecutors shouldn't exist, and I don't think I'm ever going to satisfy them. But I will also say that there is so much more work to do. And do I wish I could have done more? Absolutely.\" Beyond criminal justice, Harris spoke about other national issues with particular relevance in South Carolina, including climate change and offshore drilling, teacher pay and middle class wages.\u00a0 \"The economy isn't working for working people,\" Harris said repeatedly throughout her stops here. Political leaders are engaging in \"science fiction instead of science fact,\" was another line of her stump speech. \"I have met teachers who are working three jobs to put food on the table and pay the bills,\" she told the audience in Columbia, as the state legislature debates a public school teacher wage increase. At other moments, Harris was light on specifics. When asked by a questioner at the town hall in Columbia how she can \"square the circle\" of supporting Medicare for All and the Green New Deal resolution at a time of rising national debt, Harris replied, \"Our opponents will have you believe it's all about doling out money. It's about an investment.\" On the Green New Deal, Harris said, \"I support the goals, and we're going to have to figure out a way to get there ... I care about the environment not because I have a strong desire to hug a tree, but I have a strong desire to hug a baby.\" When asked by reporters about the recent decision by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fellow Democrat who endorsed Harris on Friday, to scale back the state's high-speed rail plan, the senator she had not had the chance to talk to him about the choice. Newsom's decision furthered criticism of the ambitious goals found in the Green New Deal framework.  And when asked whether she would declare a state of emergency over gun violence or climate change, in light of President Trump's declaration to free up border security funding, Harris said she wouldn't speculate about what she would do. \"I can tell you it is absolutely a subject, rightly, of litigation,\" she said, referring to the president's order. \"This is an emergency of this president's own creation, for political purposes, in a very irresponsible way.\" With the South Carolina primary still more than a year away, Democratic voters who attended Harris' events in the state said they were at the listening-and-learning stage of their decision-making process. \"I don't care who the person is, man or woman, whatever color they are, I want to know what they have to say and how that's going to impact my life,\" said Garvin Ladderly, a retiree from North Charleston. \"What I thought middle class life [was] going to be is not what it is. You have people living payday to payday.\" \"I think a woman will be able to bring America back together,\" said his wife Carmen Ladderly, who works for a utility company. \"The one thing about Trump is that he made us realize that there is still this separation between white and black people.\" \"I'm disappointed in America right now,\" said Sandy Taylor, a retiree from Columbia. \"I know that the world cannot be perfect, but we need to be moving more toward it than away from it \u2014 a more perfect union.\" Naida Rutherford, who owns a boutique and runs a foundation aimed at helping disadvantaged people dress for success, met Harris as the senator toured her Columbia shop.\u00a0 \"The fact that I have someone that looks like me, that speaks my language, that understands what it's like to be a woman of color in a very racially divided country at times, that's huge to me,\" Rutherford told CBS News. \"I feel like we are living history right now.\" Yet even with the nuances of the South Carolina primary, voters here consistently identified a key requirement for their eventual nominee: They want someone who can defeat President Trump.  \"Polls show voters are looking for a candidate who can win ... We're desperate,\" said one woman who asked Harris how she sets herself apart from the growing pack of contenders. Harris gave a generic answer about there being so much \"at stake,\" before settling on her pitch to be the \"fighter on the stage who knows how to fight. I do.\"\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Pakistan's envoy to Washington called for more \"active involvement\" from the United States to help defuse simmering tensions with India, claiming a lack of condemnation of India's airstrikes may have \"emboldened\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to escalate a burgeoning crisis.  \"We would certainly like to have more, and would certainly like to see more active involvement of the United States\" in addressing the standoff, said Ambassador Asad Khan, who spoke to reporters at the Pakistani embassy on Wednesday.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is in Vietnam as President Trump holds his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said in a statement issued Tuesday that he had spoken to his counterparts in India and Pakistan. Pompeo said he encouraged the two sides to \"avoid escalation at any cost,\" and urged the latter to take \"meaningful action against terrorist groups operating on its soil.\"  The United States' response to an Indian airstrike in Pakistani territory earlier this week was \"construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even more,\" Khan said.  India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers, have been locked in an intensifying dispute after a Pakistan-based extremist group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police officers in Kashmir, a divided territory in the Himalayan mountains, on February 14. The two rival nations have fought several wars since becoming independent in 1947.  On Tuesday, India launched airstrikes in Pakistan that it later claimed killed hundreds of suspected fighters. Pakistan disputed India's account, saying its jets were successfully intercepted within minutes and that no casualties resulted from bombs Indian forces had dropped in what was an \"uninhabited, remote\" area, according to Khan.  On Wednesday, Pakistan's Air Force attacked six sites in Kashmir and said it shot down two Indian aircraft that had entered its territory; one pilot was captured and is being held in Pakistan.  \"For us these strikes were not in retaliation to continued Indian belligerence but a demonstration of our right, will and capability for self-defense,\" Khan said. \"The strikes are deliberately directed at non-military targets avoiding human loss and collateral damage.\"  India has demanded the immediate return of its pilot and said it \"strongly objected\" to images that have surfaced allegedly showing him blindfolded and bloodied. Khan said the pilot \"has been treated very nicely\" by Pakistan's army but declined to say whether he would be returned.  \"We'll see, because the situation is still very fluid; this will be part of the conversations that we will have,\" Khan said.  A State Department spokesperson said the United States continued to call on India and Pakistan to \"cease all cross-border military activity.\"  \"We urge both sides to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation, including through direct communication.\u00a0 Further military activity will exacerbate the situation,\" the spokesperson said. Khan accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces significant political headwinds ahead of India's general elections this spring, of using a crisis to \"draw political mileage at home.\"  \"Pakistan has\u00a0no intention for escalation but is fully prepared to do so if forced into the paradigm,\" he said.

            "article_content": "Illinois lawmakers filed two bills in the state's legislature on Wednesday that aim to \"modernize\" its abortion laws, including repealing decades-old legislation that criminalized the pregnancy ending procedure. The bills are part of a handful around the country that addresses abortion, spurred by uncertainty surrounding the fate of Roe v. Wade. Illinois' first bill, dubbed the \"Reproductive Health Act,\" would repeal a host of non-functioning anti-abortion access laws that live on the state's law books. Even though Roe v. Wade protected abortion access for women across the country, many states, including Illinois, still have laws on the books that criminalize the procedure, though they're not in effect. \"The reality is that leaving this law on the books creates misunderstanding for doctors and invites mischief from those committed to barring all abortions in the United States,\" wrote Illinois State Rep. Kelly Cassidy in an email to CBS News. The bill would also repeal laws that previously allowed husbands to legally block their wives from obtaining the procedure as well as remove a former requirement for a fetal death certificate following an abortion. According to Cassidy, who sponsored the bill, \"abortion care, contraception and maternal care all deserve to be treated like health care, not criminal activity.\" The \"Reproductive Health Act\" would also require all private health insurance companies in the state to provide coverage for abortions. State employees and Medicaid recipients in Illinois are already guaranteed coverage, according to a fact sheet from the American Civil Liberties Union who supported the bill. The second bill introduced to the state legislature specifically addresses Illinois' 1995 \"Parental Notice of Abortion Act,\" a law that requires abortion providers to notify a parent or adult family member if a girl under the age of 18 wants to terminate a pregnancy.  With a Republican White House and increasingly conservative Supreme Court, some believe that the days of Roe v. Wade may be numbered. During a 2016 presidential debate, then-candidate Donald Trump said he foresaw the ruling being overturned if he were elected because he planned to appoint pro-life judges. He stressed the issue again in a speech before the 2018 midterm elections. In the event that the Supreme Court agrees to hear a direct challenge to Roe, and if a majority of the justices vote to overturn that precedent, it would be up to individual states to determine whether to restrict or outlaw abortion within its borders. Illinois' efforts are one of a handful of recent state-level bills that address that scenario. Last week in South Carolina, lawmakers introduced legislation that would criminalize the procedure, which echoed a successful state ballot measure in Alabama passed in November. In Louisiana, the state attempted to enact a regulation that would have closed all but one its abortion clinics. Lawmakers in blue-leaning states, including Illinois, have gone the other direction. In New York, lawmakers passed in January their own bill called the \"Reproductive Health Act\" which allows for abortions after 24 week if the fetus is not viable or if there is a risk to the mother's health. In Virginia, the state's embattled Governor Ralph Northam expressed his approval of a sweeping state bill that would expand abortion access in the state by eliminating a 24-hour waiting period.  Although the Supreme Court has not agreed to hear a direct challenge to Roe yet, it did recently temporarily block an anti-abortion access measure in Louisiana. The decision gave abortion rights advocates a glimpse into how recently appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh may view abortion as a member of the Supreme Court. Even though Kavanaugh wrote the dissenting opinion, those groups didn't get a clear look into how the new judge may view abortion issues in the future, said Travis Tu, lead counsel on the case for the Center for Reproductive Rights. \"Justice Kavanaugh plays his cards very close to the vest in this ruling,\" Tu said in a telephone interview with CBS News shortly after the Supreme Court ruling about Louisiana. \"This is just one step in a long game.\"",

            "article_content": "South Carolina lawmakers have introduced legislation that seeks to criminalize abortion and make women and their doctors subject to felony charges if they receive or perform the procedure. Their efforts mark the latest state-level push to restrict access to abortion as politicians across the country prepare for a potential overturn of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court. State Senator Richard Cash and state Representative Josiah Magnuson separately introduced \"personhood\" legislation to South Carolina's legislature this session. The House bill specifically seeks to \"establish that the right to life for each born and preborn human being vests at fertilization.\" By defining the beginning of life at fertilization, the proposals would effectively prohibit abortion, granting that the unborn can't be \"deprived of life without due process of law nor denied the equal protection of the laws.\" The Senate bill matches that language. Magnuson's law makes exceptions for when the mother's life is at risk, and specifically clarifies that the bill would not impact access to birth control methods.\u00a0Cash's legislation has similar exceptions, but it also proposes that having or performing an abortion be deemed a felony, referring to abortion as \"the shedding of innocent blood.\"\u00a0 However, the bills would not take effect -- even if they become state law -- unless the Supreme Court moves to overturn its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which prohibited states from banning abortion prior to fetus viability. The landmark ruling secured a woman's right to access the procedure across the U.S., regardless of state.\u00a0 Cash, in a telephone interview with CBS News, said that the purpose of his bill was twofold. First, if passed, the legislation could be used to challenge the high court's ruling on abortion access, potentially prompting an overturn of the original decision. Second, if Roe v. Wade is overturned, South Carolina would already have anti-abortion laws in its books, making the procedure immediately illegal, Cash said. \u00a0\u00a0 \"We're always hopeful in moving the needle and challenging the way people think about the killing of unborn children,\" said Cash, who has spent his entire professional career fighting against abortion. \"There's a need and urgency to do something at the state level and not just wait for someone else.\" \u00a0 Elizabeth Nash, a senior states-issue manager at Guttmacher, called it \"very concerning.\" \"This bill could have some momentum given the political climate,\" she told CBS News.\u00a0 Cash's bill was introduced and referred to committee Wednesday, according to the state legislator's website. Magnuson's was introduced and referred to committee in January.\u00a0 South Carolina lawmakers, including Cash, have introduced several \"personhood\" measures in the statehouse in previous sessions, but all have failed to pass.\u00a0 \u00a0 Magnuson did not immediately respond to calls and voicemails requesting comment. \u00a0 With a Republican White House and increasingly conservative Supreme Court, some believe that the days of Roe v. Wade may be numbered. During a 2016 presidential debate, then-candidate Donald Trump said he foresaw the ruling being overturned if he were elected because he planned to appoint pro-life judges. He stressed the issue again in a speech before the 2018 midterm elections. The Supreme Court has not agreed to hear a direct challenge to Roe. But if it eventually does, and if a majority of the justices vote to overturn that precedent, it would be up to individual states to determine whether to restrict or outlaw abortion within its borders. The proposals in South Carolina are similar to laws passed in other states. Voters in Alabama approved a state ballot measure in November that amended the state constitution to include that its policy was to protect \"the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life.\" The legislation also clarified that the state's official stance on abortion was to \"ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child in all manners and measures lawful and appropriate.\"\u00a0 In the event that justices overturn Roe v. Wade, the law would immediately take effect and outlaw pregnancy-ending procedures. Two other states -- Kansas and Missouri -- have similar \"personhood\" laws in place that would go into effect if Roe is overturned. In blue-leaning states, politicians have gone the other direction, successfully passing laws that dramatically expand a woman's access to abortion. In New York, lawmakers passed the \"Reproductive Health Act\" last month which allows for abortions after 24 week if the fetus is not viable or if there is a risk to the mother's health.  Last week, Virginia's embattled Governor Ralph Northam expressed his approval of a sweeping Virginia abortion bill that would expand abortion access in the state by eliminating a 24-hour waiting period. It would also allow the procedure to take place in non-hospital settings if it is performed during the second trimester, and widen availability to third-trimester abortions in the event that the mother's health is at risk. During his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, President Trump took aim at the hot-button issue, vowing to end late-term abortions while asking Congress to \"work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.\"",

On Thursday, they kicked into high gear. Thursday's hearings were just the beginning. In one hearing room, Democrats kicked off their pursuit of the president's tax returns. In another hearing room, they probed the administration's controversial move last year to separate families at the border. Just a month into their new majority, House Democrats are demanding sensitive documents that could shed light on how security clearances were granted at the White House, how companies got contracts to clean up after Hurricane Maria and whether the president's decisions have been influenced by his foreign financial interests. The president complained Thursday Democrats are \"going nuts,\" tweeting \"the Republicans never did this to President Obama.\" But they launched plenty of probes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted her parties' investigations will be carefully chosen and carried out \"They want to know the truth, they want to know the facts. And he has nothing to hide,\" she said. On Friday, Democrats are hauling Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker before Congress for the first time. They were threatening to subpoena him if he didn't answer every question but he threatened not to show up, so Democrats relented a few hours ago.

More than 1 million federal contractors are unlikely to get back pay because they aren't legally guaranteed reimbursement for missed time at work during the 35-day shutdown, according to experts and published reports. The lowest-paid of these workers typically earn $450 to $650 a week, the Washington Post reports.\u00a0 It's not just service employees like janitors, cooks and service workers who are feeling the strain. Kevin Doyle, an encryption specialist at Laughlin Air Force Base on the Texas-Mexico border and a father of three, told the Associated Press he's out $5,000 because of the record-long shutdown, alluding to the anxiety of watching bills pile up. Doyle isn't taking any chances. He starts a new job Friday with another company that he hopes will be more stable if talks between the Trump administration and congressional leaders fail, potentially leading to another shutdown next month. \"We were scraping pennies and nickels together one day to get the baby a Happy Meal,\" Doyle, 40, told the AP. \"It's just that bad.\" The federal government includes roughly 4 million contract workers, according to a 2017 report by Paul Light, a New York University professor of public service. That figure is down from 4.3 million in 2010; another 1.6 million depend on federal grants for their livelihood, according to the study. Light estimates about 1.2 million contractors. as well as those who rely on federal grants for work, were affected by the partial shutdown.\u00a0 The shutdown delayed $18 billion in federal discretionary spending, according to a Congressional Budget Office\u00a0report\u00a0released this week. The stalemate reduced economic growth in the first quarter by $8 billion, or 0.2 percent, the agency found. Most of that is expected to be recovered as the year goes on, although CBO estimates that about $3 billion in GDP will permanently be lost. The legislation that funded the government signed by President Donald Trump funds the government through Feb. 15. Another shutdown would \"create an even greater economic effect than the 35-day shutdown,\" Light told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"We know that the economic effect is due to a slowdown in spending due to worries about the future. A second shutdown in such short order would remind workers that this is a long-haul event that could return in September, giving them ample reason to clamp down on all discretionary spending through the summer and into the early fall.\" That would likely hit tourism, travel, consumer goods, and other discretionary sectors of the economy, with Light warning that it could hit consumer spending through the 2020 election.\u00a0 \"Even the hint of a shutdown right now could reduce activity,\" Light said. Some government contractors, unable to get timetables or a paycheck for ongoing work in industries like construction, laid off workers in December and January.\u00a0 Low-wage federal contractor employees should not have to bear the financial burden caused by the #TrumpShutdown. The federal government has a moral obligation to do the right thing, provide them with back pay, & stand by these hardworking Americans. #BackPayNOW https://t.co/6Je2VtXUQm A bill introduced by House Democrats earlier this month would grant back pay to contractors in retail, food, custodial or security services in any future shutdowns. A similar bill introduced in the Senate by Minnesota Senator Tina Smith has yet to attract any Republican backers, Vox reported.  -- The Associated Press contributed to this report ",

Kamala Harris, a 2020 presidential candidate, is bringing a government worker who was furloughed during the recent shutdown as her guest to the State of the Union, telling CBS News' Nancy Cordes the shutdown was \"not without harm.\" Harris and her guest Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik spoke to Cordes before the senator's pre-speech rebuttal to President Trump's address. Harris discussed the damage the extended shutdown inflicted on the 800,000 workers who went without pay. \"Whatever decision policymakers and leaders make in this place, in Washington, D.C., has a direct impact on real human beings,\" Harris said. Pesiri-Dybvik is an Air Traffic Control officer who was furloughed during the 35-day government shutdown. She and her husband, who is also an Air Traffic Control officer and worked without pay during the shutdown, lost their house during the Thomas Fire, one of the deadly wildfires which swept through California this year.

According to a press release for Harris' speech, she will \"push back on the president's expected message of division, highlight the importance of speaking truth, and outline her vision for a country that works for all its people.\" Harris told Cordes she will be \"critically evaluating the veracity\" of Mr. Trump's address Tuesday night. \"I'm going to be listening to the words, hoping and praying that there is some understanding of the way that Americans are living their lives right now,\" Harris said. Mr. Trump is delivering his second\u00a0State of the Union\u00a0address before a joint session of Congress Tuesday night at 9 p.m. ET.

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the many Democrats running for president in 2020, spoke at the Alejandro Tapia y Rivera Theater in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Tuesday evening, bringing her populist economic message the embattled American territory. Warren addressed the hardships Puerto Rico has endured in the past two years, particularly its debt crisis and the recovery in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. \"Puerto Rico has not been treated with respect,\" Warren said. Around 3,000 people died in the aftermath of Maria, and the federal government's response to hurricanes Harvey and Irma on the mainland was faster and more \"generous\" \u2014 in terms of resources and funds \u2014 than its assistance to Puerto Rico before and in the aftermath of Hurricane Mar\u00eda, according to\u00a0a newly released study. She called for the resignation or firing of FEMA Administrator Brock Long. Warren also addressed reports that President Trump is mulling calling a national emergency and using disaster funding to pay for a border wall. \"Back when he was running for office, Donald Trump promised that Mexico would pay for this wall. Now he thinks that the people of Puerto Rico who are struggling to get back on their feet should get stuck with the bill instead,\" Warren said, calling the wall \"dumb.\" \"Puerto Rico has suffered enough. We will not allow anyone to sabotage your recovery \u2013 not even the President of the United States.\"\u00a0 She also said that she supports the creation of a commission to look at the federal government's response to Maria. \"I've called for an independent, 9/11-style commission to understand how and why Washington's response to these hurricanes was so inadequate\u2014and to make sure nothing like this ever, ever happens again,\" she said. Warren also discussed Puerto Rico's $70 billion in federal debt and $50 billion in pension obligations. If Puerto Rico were a corporation or an American city, she said, it would be able to file for bankruptcy. However, an unelected oversight board was put in place by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act in 2016. This year, the board proposed cuts to almost one-third of the government budget in six years, which would affect subsidies to municipal governments and university tuition. In response, Warren has proposed a Territorial Relief Act for Puerto Rico, and said she would support Marshall Plan-style investment in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\u00a0 Warren argued that Puerto Rico has not received enough respect, and that respect begins with allowing the territory to decide upon its relationship to the United States. \"Respect for Puerto Rico means that you have the right to determine the nature of your association with the United States. Puerto Rico deserves self-determination on this question, and I will support the decision of the people of Puerto Rico,\" Warren said. She also argued that her Anti-Corruption Act would clean up Washington, and by extension help Puerto Rico. \"Washington works great for the Wall Street bankers who want bailouts, tax cuts, and no regulations, but not for the people right here in Puerto Rico,\" she said. \"We believe that when we come together, we can build a government that reflects our best values,\" Warren said at the end of her speech. \"One based on respect. One where we dream big and fight hard. And when we do that, I know that we can make real change.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "In a speech that felt as though it might pick up and head to Iowa any day, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti highlighted his administration's response to the six-day teacher strike that resulted in his first all-nighter since college. \"I did what mayors do,\" he said at a speech for an the annual U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. \"When we see a problem, we fix it,\" Garcetti said about the negotiations that reversed the hiatus of America's second-largest school district. Amidst the longest government shutdown in United States history, the pitch for tireless deal-making resonated loudly throughout the ballroom of mayors, all quick to contrast their city's checklists against a backdrop of \"broken Washington.\" \"I know that if this room stormed Capitol Hill, we would get this shutdown taken care of in a few hours,\" Garcetti said. Closing out his keynote, Los Angeles' youngest mayor declared \"it's time to demand that Washington follow our lead instead of the other way around ... It is time that our nation is led from the bottom up and not from the top down. My friends, it's time to flip Washington on its head.\" Despite an FBI probe and ongoing homelessness crisis stirring troubles on the homefront, the 47-year-old mayor told reporters to \"stay tuned\" for the possible announcement of a 2020 presidential bid. \"I don't have one,\" Garcetti said when pressed about his timeline for a decision. He said the teacher strike \"stopped my thinking\" about the political future for weeks. In 2018, Garcetti traveled to \u00a0New Hampshire on more than one occasion, and he made additional stops in key primary states such as Iowa, Nevada and Florida.   The Democratic Party has never selected a mayor as nominee, nor chosen a candidate who hails from west of the Texas border. Those barriers, Garcetti said, are not deterring him. \"I think we have a TV reality star as president. We had our first African American president,\" Garcetti said. \"The time for obviously trying new things \u2013 in both positive and sometimes negative ways \u2013 is upon us. I don't think it's about your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 anymore.\" Another new thing to try? A cabinet full of mayors, Garcetti suggested with a grin. \"I've kind of fantasized about it,\" the former Los Angeles councilmember conceded at a press conference, hypothetically floating Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan as Attorney General and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg as Treasury Secretary. \"You have all these folks who would know how to do homeland security, who would know how to run things on day one.\" If he decides to jump into the 2020 race, Garcetti will not be the first mayor to enter the presidential pool. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg announced Wednesday he is forming an exploratory committee for president. \"I get the underdog nature of this project,\" Buttigieg told reporters Thursday, \"but you've got to have a path.\" The 37-year old veteran and first openly gay candidate for president doubled down on his Oval Office vision. In response to one question about Garcetti's \"cabinet of mayors,\" Buttigieg responded, \"I don't believe in running for an office so you can have some other office. I believe you have to have a vision for that office, even if it's narrow.\" With over a year until the Iowa caucus, that narrow path could see more travelers hoping to pave a trail from City Hall to the White House. Bloomberg visited Iowa in December, while current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN earlier this month, \"I never rule things out because you never know what life brings.\" CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

            "article_content": "Editor's Note: In this story, as originally broadcast, footage of the 2015 Freddie Gray street protests in Philadelphia was mistakenly used. It has been replaced with footage of the Freddie Gray protests in Baltimore. On Thursday, we learned President Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who is headed for prison, will testify in a televised hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. It marked the beginning of season three of what's been called the \"Donald Trump Reality Show\" with a fresh plot, and new characters ushered in by voters in the midterm election who gave Democrats control of the House of Representatives. Among the recently empowered is Congressman Elijah Cummings, the new chairman of the House oversight committee. It has the constitutional authority to investigate anything it wants, creating serious problems for the Trump administration and making Cummings one of the most powerful people in Washington. Elijah Cummings has been a familiar face on Capitol Hill for a long time, a respected 13-term Maryland congressman who has served on the oversight and reform committee under four different presidents. And he was handpicked by the Democratic leaders for this job.  Rep. Elijah Cummings: We are in a fight for the soul of our democracy. And you've got to understand that. This is serious business. You can dismiss the congressman's statement as partisan hyperbole, but part of the government is shuttered, four of President Trump's former associates are now convicted felons, ten of his original cabinet secretaries have left, four under a cloud of scandal. And there are 17 other investigations underway. Not counting the ones that are about to begin in the new Democratic House of Representatives empowered with the legal authority to compel testimony and demand documents. Steve Kroft: So how are you gonna run this committee? Rep. Elijah Cummings: What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to work with the Republicans as I have in the past. You know why? Because that's our job. And when it comes to subpoena, I know the power of a subpoena, having practiced laws. In order to do oversight, you gotta have documents. You gotta have emails. You gotta have information.  For the first two years of the Trump administration that kind of information was beyond the reach of house Democrats. The power of subpoena belonged exclusively to the Republican majority. As ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, Cummings made 64 requests for subpoenas on things like White House security clearances, hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico, and the Justice Department's refusal to defend the Affordable Care Act. All of them were blocked by the Republican chairman. Steve Kroft: You've asked the White House for a bunch of things. \u00a0you've asked for documents connected to Jared Kushner's use of private emails. Child separation policy at the border. Have you ever gotten anything?  Rep. Elijah Cummings: Zero. Steve Kroft: Nothing? Rep. Elijah Cummings: Zero. --that's the point. Now, I-- I don't know if any president has ever done this. None. None that has ever said, \"I'm not givin' you anything.\" For anything. Nothing. Steve Kroft: But you're sitting here telling me you think somehow, miraculously, he's going to change. Rep. Elijah Cummings: it's not about miraculous. It's about-- adherence to the Constitution. And the American people and the Congress is insisting that he allows us to do our job. Basically what the president has done and the Republicans have done, they've joined hands. And the Republicans have been basically not only blocking but become the defense counsel for the president. Okay. But no documents? I mean, come on. Now as chairman of the oversight committee, Cummings no longer has to consult with the Republicans to issue subpoenas, initiate investigations or call hearings, and he has a much bigger budget and staff. So will Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, and Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee, but their inquiries will be limited to their specific jurisdictions. Cummings' committee has the authority to investigate anything inside or outside the federal government. Rep. Elijah Cummings: We can look at anything. Steve Kroft: You could-- Rep. Elijah Cummings: Anything. Steve Kroft: --look at Interior, you could look at E.P.A. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Anything. but the fact that we can look at anything is part of the problem. There's so much. No, I'm-- I'm serious. There's so much. Steve Kroft: And you only have two years. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Less than that. Actually, less than that. The Congress doesn't meet but so many days in a year. \u00a0And all I'm saying is that we've gotta hit the ground, not running, but flying.  Some Democrats believe Cummings should go for the jugular and push for impeachment. He says it's premature, and he also wants to pursue other issues especially the high cost of prescription drugs. His staff has already sent out 51 letters to government officials, the White House, and the Trump Organization asking for documents related to investigations that the committee may launch. The issues range from the private use of government owned aircraft by cabinet members to the flow of foreign money into various Trump enterprises like his hotel in Washington. Steve Kroft: You think he's making money off this job? Rep. Elijah Cummings: Please.  Steve Kroft: A lotta money? Rep. Elijah Cummings: A lotta money.  Steve Kroft: And-- and you say the Constitution and the laws say it's not okay? Rep. Elijah Cummings: It's not okay. And, but this is the other piece. I still believe that people-- the average citizen, the guys on my block, they oughta know if the president is making a deal, whether he's making it-- making it in his self-interest or that of the country. In response, the White House said: \"these claims are completely baseless, but we cannot comment further about ongoing litigation.\" Elijah Cummings has been in Congress for 23 years but he is not a creature of Washington. When he needs to be there he commutes from his Maryland district, an hour's drive to the north, where he represents 700,000 people and most of the city of Baltimore. He was born here 67 years ago to parents with fourth grade educations who'd been sharecroppers in South Carolina before moving north for a better life. His father worked in a chemical plant, his mother was a domestic. Both were pentecostal ministers. Rep. Elijah Cummings: First it was religion, and then it was the education. My father, Steve, had a saying. He said-- he told us, \"If you miss one day of school, that meant you died the night before.\" And he meant that. I did not miss one second of school between kindergarten and graduating from high school. Not one second. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Howard University before earning a law degree at Maryland. He says he is one of the few congressmen who live in an inner-city, working-class neighborhood.  Steve Kroft: How long have you lived here? Rep. Elijah Cummings: 37 years.  He says he keeps a campaign poster in the front window so people will know where to find him. Steve Kroft: \u00a0So you like to be among your constituents? Rep. Elijah Cummings: I like to be among my constituents. Let me tell you something man, if I don't do well in this block I'm in trouble. \u00a0I mean, if you wanna take a poll, if I lost in this block I might as well go-- I might as well stay home. When riots broke out in Baltimore three years ago after the death of a young black man, Freddie Gray, who was fatally injured in the back of a police van, Cummings gained national attention walking the troubled neighborhoods trying to keep the peace. He is part of the city's fabric.  But now he has stepped onto a much larger stage, under the bright lights of the oversight committee. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Well, I sit here. And the Democrats'll be all over here. And the Republicans will be over there. Our hearings can go anywhere from an hour and a half to 11 or 12 hours. Steve Kroft: So you got a good, comfortable chair. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Got a good, comfortable chair. And \u00a0I gotta tell you, Steve-- standing here, it just-- it sorta gives me chills in a way because I think about my journey to this chair. After years as the committee's ranking minority member, he is ready to wield the gavel and the subpoena. Steve Kroft: You've got a lotta power. But you don't have unlimited power. I mean-- Rep. Elijah Cummings: No. Steve Kroft: --and the Republicans are going to put a lot of obstacles in your way. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Sure. I expect that. \u00a0Now, there's one big elephant that's sittin' around here that we don't know-- what it's gonna yield. And that is Mueller's report. I don't know what that report is gonna have in it. One thing I do know, though, is whatever it is, even if it-- if it exonerates the president, fine. But this I do know: I want whatever it is, for the Congress to have it, and I want the public to have it, so that everybody can make a judgment.  Steve Kroft: Do you think it's possible the Republicans will try and suppress the report? Rep. Elijah Cummings: I hope not. But that's a possibility. But I hope not. I hope they don't.  Cummings' Republican foil on the committee is Ohio's Jim Jordan, one of the president's most loyal and enthusiastic supporters. Steve Kroft: You've known Elijah Cummings for a while. How would you describe your relationship? Rep. Jim Jordan: Well, look, there's-- there's not much of anything that-- that Mr. Cummings and I agree on, policy-wise. But-- I certainly respect his toughness-- his tenacity. You know, he's demonstrated that he's-- he's a fighter and I kinda-- my background is such that I kind of appreciate that. A founding member of the Freedom Caucus, Congressman Jordan is a one-time college wrestler and coach, still known for his scrappiness. He's seldom seen wearing a jacket, and always ready to go to the mat.  Rep. Jim Jordan: Taxes have been cut, regulations reduced, the economy growing at an unbelievable rate, lowest unemployment in 50 years. 312,000 jobs added last month alone. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on the courts. We're out of the Iran deal. The embassy's in Jerusalem. Hostages are home from North Korea. And oh, by the way, there's a new N.A.F.T.A. agreement. So it's an amazing record and that's what I know about the two years that we've had Donald Trump as President of the United States.  Steve Kroft: After the midterms, you wrote a letter to the Republicans saying, \"You must valiantly defend the president.\" Is that your job? Rep. Jim Jordan: My job is getting to the truth. \u00a0If the president is getting a raw deal I'm going to defend him.  Steve Kroft: I feel like I would be remiss in this if I didn't point out that truthfulness has not exactly been President Trump's strongest asset. Rep. Jim Jordan: Well, I mean, Steve, look, this-- this president's probably been attacked more than any president that-- in my lifetime. And here's what I know. Over the last two years, in spite of the unprecedented attacks that have come against President Trump, the last two years have been amazing.  Chairman Cummings wouldn't disagree that the past two years have been amazing, but in a much different way.  Rep. Elijah Cummings: I don't think the other presidents-- called a lie the truth and the truth a lie. I-- I'm gonna tell you, that's what makes the relationship so difficult. It's hard to trust. You-- you wanna believe that if you make an agreement with someone, and I believed that with the other presidents it was this way, their word was their bond. \u00a0I don't know how to compare. I-- I-- I don't. And I'm not tryin' to be smart. Steve Kroft: We're in new territory here. Rep. Elijah Cummings: Yes, it's new territory.  The new territory now includes a beefed-up White House counsel's office. \u00a0It has added more than a dozen new lawyers to fight what it anticipates will be a barrage of requests and subpoenas from congress. Steve Kroft: What happens if you issue a bunch of subpoenas and the administration doesn't respond? Or invokes executive privilege.  Rep. Elijah Cummings: We probably will end up in the courts. And one of the interesting things about the courts is that our president has been making sure that some of the most conservative judges are being p-- appointed-- to the federal bench. And I think he relies on that, and I think that he assumes that the courts will-- will possibly be, it all depends-- be helpful to him.  It promises to be a demanding time for a man who spent nearly six months in the hospital over the last year and a half for heart and knee surgery. As he showed us the victory prayer chapel, a church founded by his mother, Congressman Cummings relied on a cane and a walker. He says his chairmanship will be a physical burden on him, but his strong faith and awareness of his mortality will see him through.  Steve Kroft: Do you feel like you have the strength-- Rep. Elijah Cummings: Oh yeah, man-- Steve Kroft: --and the stamina to do this? Rep. Elijah Cummings: \u00a0Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Like I tell my-- my constituents, \"Don't get it twisted. You know, I may-- my knee may be hurtin' a little bit, but my mind is clear. My mission is clear.\" And I am prepared and able to do what I have to do. And I will do it to the very best of my ability, so help me God. This story was produced by Maria Gavrilovic. Associate producer, Alex Ortiz.

            "article_content": "Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she believed a sitting president could be indicted, disagreeing with Justice Department guidelines. Pelosi made the comments in an\u00a0interview with \"TODAY\"\u00a0Thursday morning, hours before she is set to return to the speaker's office. \"I do not think that is conclusive. No, I do not,\" Pelosi said when asked if Special Counsel Robert Mueller should adhere to DOJ guidelines that a sitting president cannot be indicted. \"I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law.\" Pelosi also said that she was not ruling out the possibility of impeaching President Trump, depending on Mueller's findings in his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. \"We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report. We shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn't avoid impeachment for a political reason,\" Pelosi said. Pelosi is currently locked in a stalemate with Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans over a funding bill to end the partial government shutdown. Mr. Trump is unwilling to sign any bill which does not include sufficient funding for a border wall. He also told congressional leaders in a meeting Wednesday that he would not sign a bill to open government agencies other than the Department of Homeland Security, because it would make him \"look foolish\" Pelosi reiterated on \"TODAY\" that wall funding was a nonstarter for Democrats. \"We can go through the back and forth. No. How many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall,\" she said. Pelosi also addressed her national unpopularity, saying that Republicans demonized her because she is effective. \"I'm effective as a legislator -- I'm excellent at that. I'm effective politically, as a fundraiser -- the best. And they have to take me down, and that's what they've tried to do,\" she said. Pelosi is set to become speaker for the second time Thursday afternoon, making her the first person to do so since Sam Rayburn in 1955. She is the first female speaker of the House.

            "article_content": "On Monday, several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates gathered at the Poor People's Campaign presidential forum in Washington, D.C. This is the first of several cattle calls in the week leading up to the\u00a0first presidential debate, and the candidates are trying to distinguish themselves and gain support. \u00a0 CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto and Jennifer De Pinto\u00a0report\u00a0that Democrats in early contest states overwhelmingly say they want a candidate who can beat President Trump, and voters in\u00a0our latest Battleground Tracker\u00a0assessed the chances of the candidates they are considering. A nominee's prospects are not an easy thing for voters to gauge \u2014 even professional campaign consultants and politicos have a challenge doing it. But in a year when Democrats seem so focused on electability, a key test for candidates this debate season will surely be convincing Democratic voters they're up to that task. At the moment, former Vice President Joe Biden elicits the most confidence from his potential backers: 75% of those considering a vote for Biden think he \"probably would win\" against Mr. Trump, and another quarter think \"maybe\" he could win. Read what voters have to say about the other candidates' chances here. PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0Mr. Trump's reelection campaign chose Orlando to officially launch his 2020 campaign, with a rally scheduled for Tuesday evening.\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson\u00a0notes that the city presents an opportunity for large gains for either party, according to data from Univision. In 2018, turnout among Hispanics who were registered Republicans saw a 60% increase over 2014, compared to a 29% increase among non-Hispanic Republicans. In Orlando, one in three new registered voters between 2014 and 2018 were Hispanic. In the same time period, Hispanic turnout increased 2.7 times as much as non-Hispanic turnout, according to the data released in April from Univision. FORMER HUD SECRETARY JULI\u00c1N CASTRO:\u00a0Castro today unveiled part one of his three-part \"People First Housing Plan,\" to solve the rental affordability crisis and end homelessness, per\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. The plan seeks to grow the supply of affordable housing by increasing funds to the Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund by at least $45 billion per year. It also calls for an end to veteran homelessness by the end of his first term and an end to chronic homelessness by 2028. \"Unfortunately we've seen that chronic homelessness in the last two years has gone up 14%,\" Castro said in a call with reporters Monday. According to the campaign, parts two and three of the plan will be released Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. REP. ERIC SWALWELL:\u00a0Swalwell released an extensive\u00a0gun violence prevention plan\u00a0Monday that includes a semi-automatic assault-style rifle ban and buyback, as well as increased requirements for legal gun ownership, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Swalwell has repeatedly said his presidential platform would be centered on gun violence prevention, and today called for significant investments in mental health and safety programs. But despite spanning six pages, some parts of Swalwell's plan fell short of Sen. Cory Booker's proposal, which would require potential gun owners to go through a process including getting fingerprinted and interviewed in addition to passing a gun safety course and background check.\u00a0 \"There's nothing that we propose here today that is at odds with what [the National Rifle Association] claims they stand for,\" Swalwell said at the news conference near the NRA's national headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, surrounded by nearly a dozen gun violence survivors and activists. And nationally, a majority of Americans support a ban on semi-automatic weapons, a\u00a0Gallup poll\u00a0found last year. But Swalwell's plan includes the creation of a national firearm registry, a policy the NRA has long opposed. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS: Harris scored the endorsement of California Rep. Jim Costa, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Stephanie Ramirez.\u00a0The campaign says Costa's endorsement points \"to her new plan to protect the millions of Dreamers in this country.\" Harris recently called for addressing DACA through immediate executive action. Costa joins the more than 80 state, local and municipal leaders from California who have endorsed Harris so far \u2014 a key advantage in a state that will likely have an outsized role due to California's earlier place in the primary calendar. OUT WEST:\u00a0We now have a date\u00a0for Nevada's coveted \"First in the West\" dinner, says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. The state Democratic Party will host candidates on November 17,\u00a0one day before\u00a0another hotly anticipated presidential forum in Las Vegas. The party has attracted thousands of attendees to similar dinners in elections past, as well as a \"raucous crowd.\" UP NORTH:\u00a0This weekend, New Hampshire's progressive lawmakers rallied together at the state's annual Progressive Summit and participated in a presidential straw poll, per\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. Sen. Elizabeth Warren won the contest with 34.6% of the vote, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders at 24%. Booker and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard tied at 6%. On the $$$:\u00a0Ahead of the president's visit to Orlando on Tuesday to relaunch his campaign, Democratic super PAC Priorities USA is launching a six-figure, week-long digital advertising campaign in the state, says\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. The ads will focus on the challenges everyday Americans face when it comes to affording health care and take aim at the president's economic policies. The effort is part of Priorities USA's larger $100 million spending campaign in Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan. It comes amid concerns the president and his allies are far outpacing Democrats when it comes to digital spending.",

            "article_content": "Produced by Marcelena Spencer and Dena Goldstein  [This story first aired on May 19, 2018] Jennifer Harris was 28 when she disappeared on May 12, 2002. Her Jeep was found abandoned on the side of the road. Six days later, a fisherman found her nude body floating in the Red River.  Police learned Jennifer had told at least one other person she was pregnant. Initially, while she was missing, police reached out to the two men in her life \u2013 James Hamilton, her ex-boyfriend, and Rob Holman, her ex-husband. Both denied seeing her the night she disappeared. \u00a0Both have denied being involved in the murder and neither has been arrested or charged with any crime related to Harris' murder. The case grew cold and along the way became part of the Bonham folklore \u2013 and its rumor mill. In 2017, then-newly elected Fannin County Sheriff Mark Johnson made good on a campaign promise to take a second look at the Jennifer Harris case. What he found was limited information and some evidence that had been damaged and destroyed by water getting into a storage pod. Johnson says he believes other evidence may have been mishandled. Daryl Parker, a former sheriff's lieutenant and Marine, is now a private investigator working with Harris' family to find answers. \"If anything happens in this case, rain or shine, anytime of day, I'm on it,\" Parker says. Also trying to solve the case is Barry Wernick, a filmmaker married to Harris' sister, Alyssa. He began working on the project two years ago. He says he's done interviews with people who were not interviewed by law enforcement early on and is following up on any leads he gets. \"Finding the killer and actually being able to prove who the killer is, will that actually be able to provide closure? Well, yeah, for my family it will,\" says Wernick. \"It doesn't get any easier,\" says Alyssa Wernick. \"There's not one day that I don't wake up and think about my sister.\" Will Parker, Wernick or Sheriff Johnson be able to solve the case? In the northeast corner of Texas, where the banks of the Red River touch Oklahoma, you'll find Fannin County and the town of Bonham, one of the oldest cities in the Lone Star State. And it's where, Mark Johnson, who had just wrapped up 32 years in law enforcement, decided to ditch retirement and run for sheriff in 2016.  Sheriff Mark Johnson: \u00a0I met Jerry Harris, the father of the young lady, on the campaign trail\u2026 And he made a promise, from one father to another, to continue the investigation into the murder of Jerry's oldest daughter, 28-year-old Jennifer Harris -- a case unsolved for more than 15 years.  Sheriff Mark Johnson: When I came here January 1 and took over \u2026 I demanded that case be brought to me.  Jim Axelrod: That was the first thing you did? Sheriff Mark Johnson: Yes. I wanted the Jennifer Harris case Jennifer's father, a Marine and Vietnam veteran, finally has hope.  Jerry Harris: I think he's serious about trying to solve this case. And he's not the only one. For the last eight years, Daryl Parker has been working with Jerry Harris to solve his daughter's murder; first as a lieutenant in the Fannin County Sheriff's Office, and now as a private investigator. Daryl Parker: A Marine never meets a stranger if he meets another Marine. He too was a Marine and Parker has never charged Jerry a dime. Daryl Parker: I still have a lot of that Captain America justice kinda thing goin' on. \u00a0\u2026I want Jerry and his family to find justice. In high school, Jennifer Harris was popular and athletic. Jerry Harris: \u2026 brilliant red-haired girl \u2026 bright brown eyes, who played tennis \u2026 and was a cheerleader\u2026 Alyssa Wernick: \u2026 she was [sighs] amazing. \u2026She was the red-haired girl who was the goof ball \u2026 adorable\u2026 loveable \u2026Lucille Ball-type. \u2026She smothered me with love.  Jennifer \"was a dreamer\" says her younger sister, Alyssa. Alyssa Wernick: She was an idealist. And she knew that there was a bigger world outside of Bonham, Texas. Daryl Parker: Bonham is probably your prototypical Small Town, USA \u2026 Gossip is on an epic scale. Jim Axelrod: When Jennifer Harris goes missing, how does that news play in Bonham? Daryl Parker: It was a bombshell. Because \u2026 this girl was not too removed from high school. To understand that she had been murdered -- it disturbed a lot of people. Jerry Harris: She was only 28 years old. She was just beginning to come into her own right when she was murdered. Sheriff Mark Johnson: The day that I came in here and looked at her case \u2026 and opened those boxes, I wanted to sit down on the floor and cry. That's because after more than 15 years, they don't have a lot to work with. \u00a0 Jim Axelrod: And what do we have in each of these boxes? Sheriff Mark\u00a0 Johnson: This is all the documentation that's in there \u2026 you know, when she first came up missing \u2026 this is a poster they're looking for her \u2026 newspaper articles, business records \u2026 and this is just some case reports. Sheriff Mark Johnson: Now this is wet. A lot of the stuff got wet \u2026 They had some pods out back. \u2026They stored a lot of evidence. \u2026They leaked \u2026 a lot of stuff got wet. Jim Axelrod: Contaminated. Sheriff Mark Johnson: Yes. Some of it got destroyed. Daryl Parker: The file was very light \u2026 Duplicates of the same paperwork over and over and over again \u2026 it was a mess.  Although the original investigators have said they did their best, Jennifer's laptop computer and clothing -- a shirt, bra, and jeans that might have been hers -- were booked into evidence but, somehow, mysteriously disappeared.\u00a0  Sheriff Mark Johnson: It's just been mishandled. Jim Axelrod: Why would it be mishandled? Sheriff Mark Johnson: I honestly don't know. The only thing I can gather out of it is lack of experience, lack of training. It was Mother's Day 2002. Jennifer was visiting her friend Kristy Farr in the early evening.  Jim Axelrod: It gets to be close to 8:00, and Jennifer's like, \"I gotta go\"? Daryl Parker: Correct. She never told Farr where she was going. But Jennifer Harris never returned home that night. The next day, Jennifer's Jeep was discovered -- parked just down the road from a local music spot.  Alyssa Wernick: I get a phone call \u2026 that her Jeep had been found \u2026 What did she do leaving her Jeep on the side of the road? While she was still missing, authorities reached out to the two men in her life: her former boyfriend and business partner James Hamilton and her ex-husband Rob Holman. Both agreed to speak with investigators without a lawyer present. They had not been arrested, but both men were read their Miranda rights. And both denied seeing Jennifer the night she disappeared: JAMES HAMILTON [police interview]: I know I'm not guilty of anything\u2026 JAMES HAMILTON [police interview]: I would love to know that she's OK, she's happy. According to his police interview, Jennifer's former boyfriend, James Hamilton, was with a friend more than an hour away from Bonham at a McDonalds around the time investigators believe Jennifer disappeared.\u00a0 He even took -- and passed -- a lie detector test.\u00a0 Daryl Parker: He had an alibi for that evening \u2026The alibi checked out. But ex-husband Rob Holman seemed concerned about his alibi: ROB HOLMAN [police interview]: I'm just \u2026 worried and scared. 'Cause I know that I don't have anybody to say where I was at that night. Holman told investigators that he had gone out that night to buy beer and visit friends. But when they weren't home, he drove around alone for five hours on the roads of rural Fannin County.  INVESTIGATOR: Sunday when you went riding around, you saw her.  ROB HOLMAN: No, I didn't see her Sunday. I saw a Jeep, but I didn't see -- I don't know whose it was\u2026 But when the investigator pushes harder. It sounds like Holman is admitting he did see her Jeep that night.  INVESTIGATOR: Where'd you see her Jeep?  ROB HOLMAN: I was on 898 at the stop sign by the blinkin' light\u2026 then I turned north. She was in front of me. She was comin' from town.  By now, Jennifer had been missing for 72 hours. The search would continue for three more days. Jerry Harris: I was getting about three or four hours a sleep a night \u2026 spent the rest of my time \u2026 searching, driving country roads \u2026looking for buzzards.  Jim Axelrod: That's a hell of thing for a father to have to do. Jerry Harris: Well, that's what I did \u2026 until they found her. Jerry Harris: Things seemed to go in slow motion for me. \u2026It was very surreal. Daryl Parker: There was a fisherman who was fishing on the Red River, he saw a body in the water. \u2026the body is completely naked. Jim Axelrod: Not a stitch of clothing? Daryl Parker: Not a sock.  Alyssa Wernick: I remember going to the Red River \u2026 to the bridge \u2026 seeing\u00a0 \u2026 the police officers, the sheriff \u2026 and I remember my dad being right there with them and I just, \"Let me see her, let me see her, let me see, is it her? It can't be her [voice breaks] \u2026Is it her? Is it her?\u00a0 Is it really her? [cries]. Finding Jennifer's body six days after her disappearance devastated her father Jerry. But it did little to clear up the mystery of what had happened to her. She was so badly decomposed the medical examiner couldn't determine the cause of death.  But Jennifer's family believes they know the answer. Her sister Alyssa and her filmmaker husband Barry Wernick are on mission to prove who killed Jennifer and why.\u00a0  Barry Wernick: Jennifer's murder impacted my wife and her family, you can't even put it in words.\u00a0 \u2026 This is much more than a passion project, because this is family.  Jim Axelrod: In the time you've been looking into this, have you gone from \u2026 \"I want the facts to shape my opinion\" to now having a sense of who killed Jennifer? Barry Wernick: Absolutely. Alyssa Wernick: To think about how beautiful she was and her red hair and just how -- [sighs] and to think about how she was found. That's what um, that's what I just can't let go of until justice is done. Barry Wernick married Jennifer Harris' sister Alyssa eight years after Jennifer's murder. Barry Wernick: When Alyssa first told me about her sister's murder \u2026 the first thing that came to my mind was, \"Who did it? Do you know who did it? \" \u2026All these things started going through my mind. The Wernicks are determined to answer those questions by making a docuseries, \"Justice for Jennifer.\" Barry, an experienced filmmaker, was a consultant on this broadcast.  Barry Wernick: I felt like I could use my filmmaking ability to do our own investigating, because it didn't seem like anyone was doing it.  He is working hand-in-hand with Daryl Parker and another private eye, Jim Holloway, re-examining everything.\u00a0  Jim Axelrod: \u00a0We are in a place -- this is central to your theory of what happened. Daryl Parker: Yes.  The reason why Daryl Parker is so sure of where Jennifer died is because of a clue that lies on the river's floor a short way down the dirt road.\u00a0 \u00a0  Daryl Parker: She had some blue mud \u2026 on the front of her \u2026 according to fishermen there are only two spots on the river within several miles that that mud is on the bottom. And the river bank is one of those spots.  Daryl Parker [at the river bank]: This is that blue marl mud that was on the body.\u00a0 Not far from the river bank there used to be the original caretaker's cottage. Daryl Parker: And it just so happened that it burned down the night Jennifer Harris disappeared. Parker suspects Jennifer left her friend Kristy Farr's house and met her killer here. He believes the cottage was burned to hide the evidence.\u00a0   Jim Holloway:\u00a0 No godly Earth reason for that shack to burn at the same night Jennifer comes up missin'. Parker hoped to find clues here. Daryl Parker: We came here \u2026 with a crew and excavated the whole thing \u202615 feet that way [pointing] to another 10 feet that way on either side of this foundation. Jim Axelrod: I see a well. Daryl Parker: We drained the well. \u2026And then we dug down in the muck, probably a foot or two \u2026 We didn't come up with anything. But years of coming up empty hasn't deterred Daryl Parker or Barry and Alyssa Wernick. And it hasn't shaken their conviction of who killed Jennifer. Alyssa Wernick: When I think about Jennifer, I think about Jennifer and Rob.  Rob and Jennifer were together for as long as anyone can remember. She was a sixth- grader when she began dating Rob, a fifth-grader. By high school the teenagers were practically inseparable, says Jennifer's cousin, Susan Bowen. Susan Bowen: He was just part of our family from the time we were growing up. \u2026Jennifer was just in love with him, she just adored everything about him. Jennifer had big dreams -- bigger than could take flight in small town Bonham.  Jerry Harris: Jennifer had potential to explore greater horizons than just Fannin County, Texas. She moved three hours away to go to college. A few years later, Rob followed her there, and the couple married in 1996. Alyssa Wernick: It was gorgeous. It was \u2026 meticulously planned at a \u2026 very beautiful mansion out in the country. One year after the wedding, Jennifer's mother died of cancer. Alyssa Wernick: You could tell she had learned a lot \u2026 in the few years that we lost our mother \u2026 she became an adult that was very open-minded.  In 1999, the couple bought a house in suburban Dallas, but there was friction brewing. Alyssa Wernick: I think that my sister was growing and evolving and moving forward in her life and Rob was stuck and he just wasn't gonna change. According to Jennifer's family, Rob, who was working in landscaping, preferred the slower pace of rural Bonham while she enjoyed living near a big city. Jennifer embraced a holistic lifestyle and enrolled in massage therapy school.  Alyssa Wernick: She transformed in front of my eyes \u2026 She said that she had met someone who was like-minded and who wanted to start a business that was a massage and wellness center. That someone was James Hamilton -- someone she'd met in that massage therapy school.  Alyssa Wernick:\u00a0 He was different, but -- Jim Axelrod: In what way? Alyssa Wernick: Well, he was new age and \u2013 Jim Axelrod: Touchy-feely? Alyssa Wernick: A little bit. Their relationship was complicated. Hamilton was living with the mother of his child, and had another on the way. Jennifer was still married to Rob.  Alyssa Wernick: \u00a0I told her that it was not a good idea, that I \u2013 Jim Axelrod: And what did she say? Alyssa Wernick: She didn't tell me a lot after that. [laughs] She knew where I stood. Jerry Harris: I went up there to see what was going on in their lives. When Jennifer's father got there he was shocked to see holes in the wall. While no one knows for sure how they got there, Jerry seems certain Holman was responsible.  Jerry Harris: He took his fist and knocked five holes in the living room wall about as big as a softball\u2026 Jerry remembers the holes in the wall. Alyssa remembers something worse.\u00a0 Alyssa Wernick: My sister called me one night and was shaking in her voice\u2026 She says Jennifer told her Rob came home drunk and forced himself on her. Jennifer never reported the alleged attack. But Rob would later tell police, after her disappearance, that Jennifer was the violent one in the relationship: ROB HOLMAN [police interview]:\u00a0 She was hot-tempered when we were married. And it was generally her way or no way. \u2026Sometimes I'd grab her, wrap her up, keep her from hittin' and s---.  Rob moved back to Bonham, and Jennifer's new love interest, James Hamilton, moved in with her. They became partners in a massage therapy business in suburban Dallas. But Jennifer's infatuation with Hamilton quickly faded. Jerry Harris: James wanted to marry her. And she refused to marry him. \u2026 And he was very -- upset about that. The private investigators say Jennifer's relationship with Hamilton was rocky. Jim Holloway: Real fiery. Just -- fussin' and fightin' at each other all the time. Jim Axelrod: By the spring of 2002, your sister is leading one complicated life emotionally. Alyssa Wernick: Mm-hmm [affirms]. Jennifer had divorced Holman and her relationship with Hamilton was on the skids. To add to the chaos, the massage business had failed and Jennifer was forced to file for bankruptcy. Alyssa Wernick: I think that everything was catching up to her and she never really grieved my mom's death and I think she was exhausted. Susan Bowen: She said, \"I'm not happy \u2026 I don't care about the business anymore.\"  With no job or income, Jennifer confided in cousin Susan Bowen that she'd been back in touch with her former husband Rob Holman, who now had a new girlfriend. Susan Bowen: And she said, \"I still love him,\" and she said, \"I want him back.\" And she said, \"I even told him that.\"  In fact, Holman later admitted to police, that even though he had a girlfriend, he and Jennifer were still having sex. INVESTIGATOR: Four or five times since Christmas? ROB HOLMAN: Yes.  Jim Axelrod: So Jennifer was living a little bit of a split life? Susan Bowen: To a certain extent. But James didn't know it. He knew nothing about it all. Then one day Bowen saw Jennifer outside her apartment with a moving truck. Susan Bowen: I said, \"What are you doing?\" And she said, \"I'm moving to Bonham.\" \u2026I thought, \"You're only going to Bonham because Rob's in Bonham.\" \u2026 \"OK.\" And with that I turned around and left. And that was the last time I ever saw her. About six weeks later, Jennifer disappeared. On the very day she went missing, she called Holman. Rob says she asked to see him, but he refused. ROB HOLMAN [police interview] I'd had plans with my girlfriend \u2026 she got real upset 'cause it was Mother's Day and I wouldn't come over. Holman agreed to take a polygraph to back up his story, but for some reason it was never administered. Sheriff's investigators allowed him to go home. They had a lot more digging to do and it centered around a secret Jennifer had shared with her best friend Jyl Wagner just weeks before she died.  JYL WAGNER [police interview]: We started talking and she said, \"You're not going to believe the mess I'm in.\" And she told me how, you know, and I pretty much guessed, I was like, \"you're pregnant.\" If Jennifer was pregnant, who was the father?\u00a0 Was it Rob Holman or someone else?\u00a0 That question became even more important after the medical examiner's autopsy revealed a stunning piece of information. When they examined Jennifer Harris' body, investigators were shocked.  Daryl Parker: There was a wound that affected some of the internal organs. Her uterus was missing. LOCAL NEWS REPORT: Her death was classified as a quote \"violent homicide.\" Her uterus had somehow been removed. Daryl Parker:\u00a0 The question was \u2026 What damaged her?  Jim Axelrod: What would've the motive been?  Daryl Parker: \u2026that she was possibly pregnant, and that the person who killed her was trying to destroy that evidence\u2026 In Bonham, where gossip is often taken for gospel, people couldn't stop talking.\u00a0  Daryl Parker: The public grabbed a hold of that information and they started concocting their own theories as to who did it and why But according the case file, there was no scientific evidence to prove Jennifer was actually pregnant at the time of her death.  Still, Jennifer's best friend Jyl Wagner told investigators she had talked to Jennifer about being pregnant. And, that's not all she said.\u00a0  JYL WAGNER [police interview]: You know, she told me that it was Rob's and I was kinda shocked\u2026 Rob Holman -- Jennifer's ex-husband. He had revealed to detectives, in his police interview, that he had met Jennifer a month before she disappeared, near a drive-in movie theatre: ROB HOLMAN [police interview]: She told me that she was pregnant and that it was mine\u2026 Alyssa Wernick: I definitely think that she brought it up with Rob and in my mind that's what led to her death. Daryl Parker had long been familiar with the story of Jennifer being pregnant. Eight years after her murder, Parker, then a lieutenant for the sheriff's department, dropped by Rob Holman's house. It was Sunday. Mother's Day. A calculated move by Parker.  Daryl Parker: It was the anniversary of the crime. I had \u2026 picked out of number of photographs of her and Rob, one of those being Jennifer swimming in a muddy body of water \u2026 and when I gave him the stack of photographs, the very first one he picked out was that one with the muddy water. He stood there for about five to six seconds staring at that photograph. Jim Axelrod: But that's the one that caught his attention? Daryl Parker: Like that [snaps fingers]. You know, I said, \"well, if you want to talk, call me,\" and I gave him my card and I left.  A few hours later, to his surprise, Holman called and wanted to talk. But Parker had wanted to record the interview so he suggested they meet at the sheriff's office the next day. Daryl Parker: That's where I screwed up \u2026 I should have gone right then and there \u2026 I think he was ready to talk and say something. And I should have just done it [becomes emotional]. Jim Axelrod: This really has you, still. Why so emotional Daryl? \u2026You're really blaming yourself here? Daryl Parker [wipes away a tear]: Well, the previous investigation, it failed in so many ways. \u2026 But he was responding to me. He was responding to the pressure I was putting on him and I let it slip away. When Holman arrived for the interview with Parker, he had a lawyer: DARYL PARKER: Did you have anything to do with the death of Jennifer Harris? ROB HOLMAN: No.  DARYL PARKER: Jennifer's pregnancy \u2026 Did you believe she was pregnant? ROB HOLMAN: No, I didn't think she was. DARYL PARKER: Did you think she believed she was pregnant?  ROB HOLMAN: No. Remember, there was no evidence Jennifer was pregnant and, in fact, forensic experts in Dallas would later conclude Jennifer's missing uterus wasn't even cut out by the killer. Instead, her uterus and other body parts were destroyed by turtles and fish in the river. But the rumors persisted and they had plenty of company in Bonham.  A year after Jennifer's murder, Myles Porter found himself in the center of the storm. Myles Porter: They were saying that I had been arrested for this murder. \u00a0 Jim Axelrod: I mean you hear this, and what's your reaction? Myles Porter:\u00a0 \"What are you talking about? Where did this come from? That's crazy.\" Crazy, because Porter was also the district attorney at the time overseeing the case.\u00a0  Jim Axelrod: For the record, did you know Jennifer Harris? Myles Porter:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 Jim Axelrod: Had you ever met Jennifer Harris?\u00a0 Myles Porter:\u00a0 No. Jim Axelrod: Did you kill Jennifer Harris? Myles Porter: Absolutely not.  Porter says locals cooked up the story because they had a grudge against him over an unrelated case he tried.  Jim Axelrod: Did this cost you your job? Myles Porter: Yeah, no doubt. Myles Porter blames losing his re-election on the Jennifer Harris gossip.\u00a0 Now in private practice, Porter still lives with the fallout from the unfounded allegations.  Myles Porter: I've had, on a number of occasion, random people throughout the county say, \"I can't be fair in this case because you're the lawyer and I think you killed Jennifer Harris.\" Crazy.  Jim Axelrod: Fourteen, 15 years later? Myles Porter: Absolutely, still happens.  Daryl Parker: \u2026in the court of public opinion, he was definitely a suspect. Jim Axelrod: Meanwhile, there's no shred of evidence that he was connected at all? Daryl Parker: None. Daryl Parker thinks he knows who's responsible.  Daryl Parker: Not Myles Porter, not James Hamilton, not a random stranger \u2026 In my view, the evidence points directly to Rob Holman. Filmmaker Barry Wernick agrees. Barry Wernick: We were gonna let the facts take us where the facts took us, and where it brought us was to one person that it had to be.\u00a0  But they haven't been able to physically connect Rob Holman to Jennifer Harris the night of her disappearance. They're both hoping Rhonda Fitzwater can. Barry Wernick: We need that eyewitness. Jim Axelrod: And in your view Rhonda Fitzwater is that eyewitness? Barry Wernick: Yes. On a rural road in Fannin County, Texas, Rhonda Fitzwater could hold the key to Daryl Parker and Barry Wernick's theory that Rob Holman met up with Jennifer Harris that night.\u00a0 Jim Axelrod: On Mother's Day, 2002, no different than any other day, you take the walk. Rhonda Fitzwater: Right \u2026I saw a Jeep, but I didn't think anything about it \u2026 But then when it was here the second day, you're, like, \"Why is that Jeep still here?\" Jim Axelrod: So what do you make of this idea that somehow you saw Jennifer Harris and Rob Holman? Rhonda Fitzwater: I've not ever heard that until you told me that. \u00a0 Fitzwater has always insisted that all she saw that night was Jennifer's parked Jeep.\u00a0  Jim Axelrod: Did you see anybody following the Jeep? Rhonda Fitzwater: No. It was already parked.  Jim Axelrod: Did you see Jennifer Harris? Rhonda Fitzwater: No, not at all. But for years, Parker and Wernick have believed there is more to Rhonda Fitzwater's story. Only she says they are sorely mistaken. After 15 years of investigation by people closely connected to Bonham, maybe the best thing anyone can hope for is a fresh set of eyes. Joe Moura: I'm flying out to Dallas, Texas \u2026 my job is to really look at the facts of the case, study the case.\u00a0  Could the questions about a murder in Bonham be answered by someone 1,700 miles away in Boston? Meet Joe Moura, a private investigator and CBS News consultant. Jim Axelrod: Jennifer's been dead 15 years by the time you're looking at the file. Joe Moura: Absolutely, yeah Jim Axelrod: What'd you make of that collection of papers? Joe Moura: I thought the file was very weak, meaning that the investigation that went into it was extremely weak. \"48 Hours\" brought Moura to Texas to take a closer look at the Jennifer Harris case. Joe Moura: You gotta speak to people. And that's what I've done. His first stop is Fannin County Sheriff Mark Johnson. Joe Moura: \u00a0I can see your frustration where \u2026you're in the job for one -- one year you got the public -- I'm sure the family still wants to know what happened to their daughter. Sheriff Mark Johnson: There's no -- no physical evidence. That's the problem. In fact, today the sheriff won't call either Rob Holman or James Hamilton suspects, even though detectives did early in the investigation in their case documents. \u00a0  Jim Axelrod:\u00a0 How come you can't call them suspects?\u00a0  Sheriff Mark Johnson: You have things that lead up to 'em, that draw your interest to 'em to make them a person of interest, but you don't have that connection to make them a suspect where you can tie some physical evidence in to them.\u00a0  Filmmaker Barry Wernick took Moura to the location of the cottage private investigators Parker and Holloway had come to believe was burned to hide the evidence of Jennifer's murder. Joe Moura: This stuff, Jim ,with a burning shed \u2026 there's all kinds of theories about that ... now, you just murdered somebody \u2026 but about 200 yards away from where you are disposing of the body in the river, let's light up this shed in fire, attract people. Jim Axelrod: Makes no sense to you Joe Moura: Absolutely not. \u2026it certainly can't tie it to this case, but people are trying to make it tie in. Wernick also brought him to the bank of the Red River, where he believes his sister-in-law's body was dumped.\u00a0 Joe Moura: There's nothing on the records of the case or any eyewitnesses that will tell you that this is where her body was disposed. Barry Wernick: Right Joe Moura: So, we're just here basically guessing. Moura sat down with the private eyes who had been working the case for nearly a decade.\u00a0  Jim Holloway: To me, I think it boils down to who had the most to lose by killin' her or not killin' her? Eighteen years of child support? Maybe? Maybe not? ROB HOLMAN [police interview]: She told me that she was pregnant and that it was mine\u2026 Daryl Parker: I don't think that we need to speculate about Rob Holman's motive \u2026 because he made it clear that she was applying pressure to him. Jim Axelrod: \u2026and there could be no more intense pressure than \"I'm about to have a baby and you're the father?\" Jim Holloway: That's right.  Joe Moura: You have to consider it \u2026 however he disbelieves her and he admits that in the interviews. He actually said it, \"I don't believe it and I don't think she is pregnant.\" DARYL PARKER: Did you believe she was pregnant? ROB HOLMAN: No. I didn't think she was. For his part, Moura was surprised authorities seemed to quickly disregard James Hamilton, the ex-boyfriend who wanted to marry Jennifer before she left him when their business failed.\u00a0  Joe Moura: She covered all the finances for the business, she's the one that put her name on the loans. Jennifer's father Jerry made notes that two months after Jennifer's death, Hamilton called him asking about her life insurance policy. Joe Moura: In my experience, money, insurances, all that stuff is a big deal. Money creates a lot of motive for a lot of people. What's more, he believes investigators bought Hamilton's alibi -- that he was with a friend at that McDonalds more than 50 miles away -- without thoroughly vetting it.  Joe Moura: And I'm not so thrilled about the checking they did on that alibi. Daryl Parker: No. Joe Moura: The one thing is you go check with the alibis \u2026 And the next thing you -- you look at, \"Are these alibis lying to me?\" So you gotta go check that out. That was never done. Why? To Joe Moura, the investigation was flawed from the outset. And had authorities approached it differently, they may have gotten more from their interviews. \u00a0  Joe Moura: Here's what bothers me about this situation. It's a missing person. They're calling people, talking to people about a missing person, and the first thing they do is read you Miranda warnings.  INVESTIGATOR: So, you have the right to remain silent \u2026 Do you understand all that? ROB HOLMAN: Right. Joe Moura: Now that is unheard of. Jim Axelrod: You're saying that sure, Rob said I don't have an alibi and that might be incriminating\u2026. Joe Moura: That was after he already signed the Miranda warning. So he's already nervous and he's already saying, \"Oh I'm being charged. God, I don't have an alibi\" \u2026 of course he was nervous. Most people would be.  But at the end of the day, the men who've been working this case for years see it very differently than the man with the fresh set of eyes.\u00a0  Daryl Parker: \u2026circumstantially there is a lot of evidence in this case. Daryl Parker: \u2026It is all circumstantial. Joe Moura: But Daryl, I think me and you are a little confused in reference to circumstantial \u2026 I'm saying to you and I submit to you that there's very little circumstantial evidence, OK? Daryl Parker: We'll have to agree to disagree. Joe Moura: Well, because I am asking you to give me the facts on what your circumstantial evidence is -- Daryl Parker: Sure. Joe Moura:\u00a0 --and it's based on theory \u2026 and theory ain't gonna cut it.  Like Daryl Parker's theory about Rhonda Fitzwater knowing more.\u00a0  Joe Moura: Everybody's putting all the weight on this woman and she has nothing to offer to the case. Only that yeah, that Jeep was there. Well, we know the Jeep was there.  But what Joe Moura does find interesting in the case file is one of the least examined parts of the story. One year after Jennifer's murder, Deborah Lambert -- who had seen a news report about the unsolved case -- told detectives she saw something when she was driving across the Red River Bridge on Mother's Day.\u00a0  DEBRA LAMBERT [police interview]: ...there was three guys out there and a girl. And two guys had the girl by her elbows and it was like she was trying to get away from them and they were restraining her\u2026 The girl she says she saw had reddish-brown hair.  DEBORAH LAMBERT [police interview]: \u2026I made eye contact with her and \u2026 she was scared, terrified look on her face\u2026 my mom seen her too and she said \"that girl's fixin' to get raped and killed\" \u2026 But Lambert never called police back then. She said she was too afraid to get involved. What's more, her story didn't fit with the investigators' timeline. She put Jennifer near the bridge at 5 p.m., but detectives believed Jennifer left her friend Kristy's Farr's house around 8 p.m. Jim Axelrod: Deborah Lambert's saying what she saw, she saw at 5 o'clock. That's not a deal breaker for you. Joe Moura: Absolutely not \u2026 In the real world, people are not looking at their watches and clocks all the time \u2026 she may be wrong on her time and not wrong on what she witnessed. Could Deborah Lambert hold the answer to who killed Jennifer Harris? Every month, the Riders for Justice, ride for Jennifer Harris. Forrest Morris: What Riding for Justice has done is reached out to people that knew Jennifer Harris.  Jim Axelrod: Something has touched the people of Fannin County about this case. Forrest Morris: Absolutely.\u00a0 \u2026Everybody in this county wants to see this case solved.  Teresa Morris: To let somethin' like this go on this long is uncalled for. Forrest Morris: Jennifer Harris was well loved here. \u00a0 A year-and-a-half after Jennifer's murder, the Texas Rangers launched their own investigation into the case. They reinterviewed Deborah Lambert.  Joe Moura: The story was the same \u2026 She was very detailed. Redhead, three guys, two were wearing jeans, one was wearing shorts Lambert was asked to look at a photo lineup to see if she recognized any of the men the woman was with. She did. She was very clear that one of the men she saw was Rob Holman.  Joe Moura: Maybe Mrs. Lambert is believable. \u2026Now the situation is, is I worry about how is that lineup done? How many photographs do they show? In other words, do they have a good old boy -- Texan boy there with his baseball cap on? And then they had three Mexican photos next to him, OK? Those are the things I worry about.  Jim Axelrod: The way that the lineup was conducted, we don't know anything about. Joe Moura: No, and that's -- that's crucial. But Moura can't be confident because there are no details in the case file about how the lineup was done. Still, Moura considers Deborah Lambert a missed opportunity to potentially solve Jennifer's murder. Joe Moura: There's an open lead there that I feel wasn't closed \u2026 therefore until that lead is closed, it's problematic to say, \"I'm gonna disregard what this woman saw and I'm still gonna focus on Rob and James.\" Rob Holman, on the advice of his attorney back then, declined to speak with the Texas Rangers. After working the case for a year, they suspended their investigation. \"48 Hours\" wanted to know why, but they wouldn't comment on an unsolved case. The conclusion to their report: \"No physical evidence, specific cause of death, or credible witnesses \u2026 link any particular person as a suspect.\" No one can actually follow up with Debra Lambert. She and her mother have both passed away.\u00a0 But Alyssa and Barry Wernick now cling to Lambert's story. Alyssa Wernick: In my mind I always just believed that she got in the truck with Rob and it was just the two of 'em. This changes everything. There are other people that know. There are other people that could possibly speak up. Barry Wernick: Now knowing that there were two other people involved, oh, yeah. There is renewed hope. Jim\u00a0 Axelrod: The problem here, I suppose, is that Deborah Lambert's dead? Barry Wernick: She is dead but her -- her interview isn't. She's alive. You can see what she said. Neither James Hamilton nor Rob Holman have ever been arrested or charged with any crime related to Jennifer's murder. During \"48 Hours\"' reporting of this case, we made several attempts to contact both men: JIM AXELROD [on phone leaving message]: James, if this is your number, I'm calling to follow up on a letter I sent you recently. \"48 Hours\" got no response. \u00a0 ROB HOLMAN [voicemail]: This is Rob. I can't take your call right now.  JIM AXELROD: [on phone leaving message]: We sent you a letter a couple of weeks ago. So, on one of \"48 Hours\"' trips to Texas, we went to Rob Holman's home. \u00a0 Jim Axelrod: How are ya? Mr. Holman? Jim Axelrod with CBS News. Rob Holman: Turn that off. Jim Axelrod: Will you talk to me if I turn that camera off? Rob Holman: Yeah, I'll talk to you if you turn it off. Holman told us off camera he never saw Jennifer that night and he's been advised by his attorney not to talk to anyone. His attorney provided this statement to \"48 Hours:\" \"Robert Holman has neither been arrested nor charged with any criminal conduct as it relates to this investigation. This notwithstanding, Mr. Holman has, from the inception of the investigation, been treated by law enforcement as a suspect. Mr. Holman has maintained his innocence from the very beginning and his position has not wavered.\" With no resolution in sight, filmmaker Barry Wernick has a new plan.\u00a0  Jim Axelrod: Barry wants to raise $50,000 under the theory that reward money could shake someone loose. Jim Moura: No shot. \u2026You can't put money out there and thinking that that's gonna create evidence for you. Joe Moura said as much to the sheriff.\u00a0 Joe Moura [to Sheriff Mark Johnson]: This isn't a cold case. This is a frozen case. It's done. It's over.  Joe Moura [to Jim Axelrod]: If you have a prosecutor who's worth his weight, he would never bring this case to trial. He has absolutely nothing on this case.  But Sheriff Johnson is not giving up. Sheriff Mark Johnson: I want to solve the case. I want it solved and I want it done right. Neither is private eye Daryl Parker. \u00a0  Daryl Parker: When Mr. Harris came to the sheriff's office and he got me involved \u2026 I told him that I would get results. And I can't, I can't put it down. \u2026until I'm sure that either the person is held accountable or I can't do anything more, I have to carry it.  Jim Axelrod: And if it takes another 15 years?  Daryl Parker: If it takes another 15 years. Joe Moura: The sadness is we all have kids. We all have family members. And I have a daughter. It's devastating to not know.  Alyssa Wernick: I don't know how she was killed. I wish I did. I want closure \u2026 I'm gonna do everything I can to bring justice for Jennifer. \u2026for my Dad, he needs to see some justice done. Jerry Harris: To have walked in my shoes for the last 15-and-a-half years hasn't been easy. \u2026 we miss her every day. \u2026 we miss Jennifer not bein' here \u2026 I still have high hope that justice will prevail.  Anyone with\u00a0 information about the Jennifer Harris case is asked to contact the Fannin County Sheriff's Office at 903-583-2143.",

            "article_content": "Nancy Pelosi is the most powerful woman in American political history. She's been speaker of the House not once, but twice. And President George W. Bush's nickname for her was \"3\" because of her place in line for the presidency.\u00a0 Under her leadership last year, the Democrats won back control of the House. The San Francisco liberal is now the voice of her party and chief critic of President Trump; she's also keeping close tabs on at least six House committees investigating the president. And she's pressing for release of the full, unredacted Mueller report. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: The Mueller report is about an attack on our elections by a foreign government. And we want to know about that. We wanna know about that in terms of being able to prevent it from happening again. So it's bigger even than Donald Trump.\u00a0 She says she doesn't trust Attorney General William Barr. Lesley Stahl: Do you think that the attorney general is covering anything up? Speaker Nancy Pelosi: I have no idea. I have no idea. He may be whitewashing, but I don't know if he's covering anything up. There's no use having that discussion. All we need to do is see the Mueller report. Lesley Stahl: And asking for the president's tax returns? Speaker Nancy Pelosi: It should not have taken this long for the president-- he said he was under audit. When I was in a-- I was going to a Martin Luther King breakfast in San Francisco and one of the waiters there said to me, \"Madame Speaker, when the president says the Mueller report's going on too long just tell him not as long as your audit.\" (LAUGHTER) Everybody has released their returns and we will have legislation to say that everyone should-- must, but for the moment he's been hi-- so what's he hiding? She's just hit her 100th day as speaker. She recently called the president to ask for a meeting on infrastructure, but there's no sign that the gridlock that has plagued Congress for years is easing.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: One of the complaints we've heard is that you don't reach across the aisle because it seems like right now nothing is getting done. You pass things-- whatever it is dies in the Senate. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Nothing died. Nothing's died. We already put together 100 days, the fact that we even passed them in the House is a victory. Let's figure out the places-- figure out where we can find common ground. There's always been bipartisan support for Dreamers, bipartisan support for gun safety, bipartisan support for infrastructure. Lesley Stahl: But why doesn't anything get done-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi: We just started. Lesley Stahl: --with the Dreamers? Speaker Nancy Pelosi: We just started. We're three months since we were in-- in office. Lesley Stahl: But you're talking about 100 days. This president's been in office for two years plus. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: And we've been here three months. Hey, may I introduce you to the idea of the spout-- power of the speaker is to set the agenda. We didn't have a speaker who would bring a gun bill to the floor. We didn't have a speaker who would bring a Dreamers issue to the floor. We do now. And that's a very big difference. The power of the speaker is awesome. Awesome. But her becoming speaker was in doubt last December when a group in her caucus agitated for a change to someone younger. It was the president, of all people, who rescued her, in that now famous Oval Office meeting.\u00a0 President Trump in Oval Office meeting: You know, Nancy's in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now.That did not sit well with her.\u00a0 Speaker Pelsoi in Oval Office meeting: Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength I bring to this meeting as a leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory\u2026 Right after the meeting, she walked to the mics in her orange coat, with a whole new image, her ascendance to the speakership no longer in jeopardy. Lesley Stahl: You seem to be one of the very, very few people who have stood up to him and won. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: No, people do. People do. It-- it is-- Lesley Stahl: Maybe not so much in public the way-- this was televised. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Well, that was his problem. In other words I tried to say let's not have this conversation in the public domain because you're saying things that we have to contradict because they're not true. And he said, \"Oh, I want the public to see it.\" Well, you want them to see that you don't-- don't know what you're talking about? Really? Lesley Stahl: Here's what you've said. You've said, \"If someone's ripping your face off. You rip their face off.\" (LAUGH) Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Oh yeah, I would do that. Lesley Stahl: And that's what it was like. (LAUGH) And, you know, you have this-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Yeah, I probably said that. Yeah. They just have to know. You throw a punch, you better take a punch. Lesley Stahl: From a grandmother. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Yeah. Then, at the State of the Union, she did her mocking clap and it went viral. Now, if you go to her own campaign website, you'll see she's touting herself as \"The Patron Saint of Shade.\" Lesley Stahl: This is your new branding of Nancy Pelosi. Kind of like a giant slayer almost, or-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Well, I think that it-- Lesley Stahl: --muscular. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: No, I think I happen to be a manifestation of the women power that is coming forth now, but only one manifestation. Today she's a more self-assured Nancy Pelosi, more willing to promote herself.\u00a0 Speaker Pelosi at November 7, 2018, press conference: I think I'm the best person to go forward. She told us that our Democratic values are being threatened, and says unabashedly, that she is the right person to stand up for them. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: As our founders said, when they declared independence and established a new nation, The times have found us. The times found Lincoln. Not to be presumptuous to put ourselves in those categories, but the times have found us, not because we're so great, but because of the urgency that-- of the-- situation that our country faces because of the situation in the White House. In January she swore in the 116th Congress. That includes 43 new Democrats from Republican districts who are called \"the moderates.\" Plus, the most diverse caucus in history with unprecedented numbers of people of color and a record 91 women. She is given high marks, even among Republicans we spoke to, for her skills as a legislator and effective negotiator.\u00a0 We spoke to a group of Democratic congresswomen, veterans and freshmen, to ask how she wields her power.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Rep. Anna Eshoo: She constantly is weaving, weaving people together. Rep. Karen Bass: I-- I like the way that the president can't figure out-- Rep. Anna Eshoo: And she is a moderating force. Rep. Karen Bass: \u00a0--how to deal with her. VOICES: Yes. (CLAPPING) Rep. Karen Bass: The president has no idea. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici: But-- but part of that is because she has the experience. It's not easy to get through-- the legislative process in congress. Rep. Primila Jayapa: As the co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, she doesn't try to shut something down before it needs to be shutdown. Lesley Stahl: How many of you are going to be willing to tell me how afraid you are of her? Rep. Ann McLane Kuster: She's the first person in my life that has (LAUGH) scared the heck out of me. (LAUGH) I'm honestly-- but I have so much respect for her. And it's this combination of courage and grace. Lesley Stahl: But why were you afraid of her? Rep. Ann McLane Kuster: Trust me. You don't wanna cross her. (LAUGH) Lesley Stahl: It's what I heard. Rep. Ann McLane Kuster: There were times early on where we had to take difficult votes. (LAUGH) I'm kind of embarrassed. We would run to the ladies room after the vote. Lesley Stahl: You'd run and hide? Rep. Ann McLane Kuster: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: Some of them told us that they're afraid of you. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Oh, no, they're not. Lesley Stahl: And if they vote against you, if they don't toe the line, that they run out the back-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Oh, they do that, yeah. Lesley Stahl: --and they hide in phone booths, and they run--\u00a0 Speaker Nancy Pelosi: But the men do that, too. That's not just the women. But she does get pushback, for instance, from 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, AOC, who has proposed some out-of-the-mainstream measures.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: So you are contending with a group in Congress: Over here on the left flank are these self-described socialists, on the right, these moderates. And you yourself said that you're the only one who can unify everybody. And the question is can you? Speaker Nancy Pelosi: By and large, whatever orientation they came to Congress with, they know that we have to hold the center. That we have to be m-- go down the mainstream. Lesley Stahl: They know that-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi: They do. Lesley Stahl: But it doesn't look like that. It looks as if it-- you're-- it's fractured. She likes to minimizes the conflicts within her caucus. Between the moderates and the progressives.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: You have these wings-- AOC, and her group on one side-- Speaker Nancy Pelosi: That's like five people. Lesley Stahl: No, it's-- the progressive group is more than five. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Well, the progressive-- I'm a progressive. Yeah. Lesley Stahl: Well, as I understand it the progressives want radical change. They wanna get rid of Obamacare and replace it with Medicare for all. I was under the impression that you had said that you do not favor Medicare for all, that-- ACA, Obamacare is better. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Well, Affordable Care Act is better than Medicare, there's no question about that. The Affordable Care Act benefits are better. Medicare doesn't have a catastrophic plan. So if you want Medicare for all you're gonna have to change Medicare and let's take a look at that. Lesley Stahl: Well, Medicare for all-- it's not only being pushed by some members of your caucus, but also some of the presidential candidates. And it is allowing the president to say you're all socialists. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Do you know that when we did Med-- when Medicare was done by the Congress at the time, under Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan said, Medicare will lead us to a socialist dictatorship. This is-- this is an ongoing theme of the Republicans. However-- I do reject socialism as an economic system. If people have that view, that's their view. That is not the view of the Democratic Party. Speaker Pelosi is now the most public face of the Democratic Party. Its most successful fundraiser and the agenda setter.She works tirelessly, always on the move - in three-inch heels \u2013 at 79. Even when she takes time to visit one of her 9 grandchildren, as she did recently with Bella and her mother Christine, Nancy's second, it's brief. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: This weekend, I came from Washington to San Francisco. On Sunday-- I'll be in Los Angeles. Monday, St. Louis. And then Chicago and then New York. Lesley Stahl: Wow. Speaker Nancy Pelosi: And then Boston. And then Florida. (LAUGH) And then back to California. And then back to Washington.Lesley Stahl: That's one week? Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Yeah. (LAUGH) Yes, that's one week. A lot of peanuts and pretzels on the plane. (LAUGH)It's not exactly an accident that Nancy Pelosi became speaker, given how she grew up. Politics was the family business: her father, Thomas D'Alesandro, was a congressman from Baltimore and then the mayor.\u00a0 Speaker Nancy Pelosi: I was born into a family that was devoutly Catholic, deeply patriotic and staunchly Democratic. She got married right after college to Paul Pelosi, an investment banker, and had five children in six years. At age 46 she was drafted to run for Congress and won in 1987, when there were only 23 women in the House. Lesley Stahl: When there were only 23-- did any of the big bulls, the men-- it was a men's club, obviously-- encourage you to run for leadership, to lift your head up? Speaker Nancy Pelosi: You have to understand. When they're only 23, men are not threatened by the women in Congress, you understand? They're not threatened by that. \"That's-- that's nice. That's nice, we have some women here--\" Lesley Stahl: Pat you on the top of your head? Speaker Nancy Pelosi: But when you get to have numbers and you wanna be-- run for leader, then that's a different story. Then they're, like, \"Why are they all gathering in the well?\" They all have the same color on today. What are they up to?\"\u00a0 In her prime, at nearly 80, she's deploying everything she's got into keeping the House in Democratic hands, flipping the Senate and, above all, defeating the president. Lesley Stahl: How would you describe President Trump? Speaker Nancy Pelosi: How would I describe him. I think that he describes himself on a daily basis and-- I think that there's nobody in the country who knows better that he should not be president of the United States than Donald Trump.Lesley Stahl: You think he knows it himself? Speaker Nancy Pelosi: I think he does. Yeah. But I respect the office he holds and, uh, he's not-- worth the trouble of saying you're so horrible we can't work together. No, we need to work together. Lesley Stahl: You have complained, I'm quoting you, President Trump h-- is engaged in an \"unconstitutional assault on the Constitution.\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi: That's right. He has. Lesley Stahl: And what do you think the future of our system is if that's true? Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Well, I think our future-- is strong enough-- built on a strong foundation to withstand everything including the current occupant of the White House. I don't think for two terms though. Produced by Ruth Streeter and Kaylee Tully.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 A day after impeaching President Trump, the House is moving on and it wants the Senate to follow. The impeachment inquiry consumed the House for the past couple of months, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a press conference on Thursday to urge the Senate to act on the bills it has passed. The House passed more than 400 bills this year \u2014 275 of them with bipartisan support. Pelosi, joined by several freshman members of the House, stood next to a toddler-sized stack of paper that represented all of the bills that are sitting in the Senate.\u00a0 \"The time to act is now, Senator McConnell. We are waiting,\" said Florida Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made clear that his priority is confirming judges, not passing legislation.\u00a0 \"My motto for the remainder of this Congress is leave no vacancy behind,\" he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday. House Democrats highlighted bills lying dormant in the Senate that would lower prescription drug costs, sign the United States back onto the Paris Climate Agreement, reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and strengthen gun control laws. Mucarsel-Powell also pushed for action on a bill that would provide so-called Dreamers, young adults brought to the U.S. by their parents, a pathway to citizenship. \"Our Dreamers are as American as any one of us, except on paper,\" she said. Katie Porter, a California representative, advocated for the Raise the Wage Act that would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 within six years. \"Working families shouldn't have to choose between putting a roof over their heads and putting food on the table,\" she said. Lucy McBath, a congresswoman from Illinois, praised Congress for funding gun violence research but called on the Senate to pass bills that would close gun loopholes and strengthen background checks. She was driven to run for office after her son was shot and killed while sitting in the backseat of a friend's car at a gas station. \"It's not about partisan politics. It's about saving lives,\" she said. The House Democrats also addressed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is set to pass Thursday afternoon. Unlike most legislation, the Senate is expected to sign the trade deal because it hands Mr. Trump a major victory. He campaigned on a pledge to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It's the result of months of negotiations with the White House. McConnell, however, said the Senate won't vote on it until after the impeachment trial and blamed \"Speaker Pelosi's impeachment obsession.\" Congresswoman Haley Stevens, of Michigan, pressured him on Wednesday to take action sooner. USMCA, she said, \"is a long overdue compromise ... that you don't see so often in this body. ... The question is, will the Senate act?\" Mr. Trump is the third U.S. president to be impeached. The House voted to impeach him for abusing his power and for obstructing Congress. The first charge relates to his dealings with Ukraine. He solicited election help from the foreign country. The latter charge is the result of him blocking evidence and witnesses from the House impeachment inquiry. The impeachment process now heads to the Senate, which will hold a trial. Before that can happen, the House must name \"impeachment managers,\" who act as prosecutors during the trial. But Pelosi said the House won't name\u00a0impeachment managers\u00a0until the Senate finalizes its procedures for the trial. The Senate still has to determine whether to call witnesses, what kind of evidence to admit, and how long to make the trial. Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story misidentified Katie Porter as a representative of Iowa. She is in fact a representative of California.",

            "article_content": "After campaigning throughout the Hawkeye State on Tuesday, President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden each have one event in Iowa in the evening. Our\u00a0Political Unit intern Julia Cherner\u00a0reviewed a copy of Biden's prepared remarks and counts 84 times the former vice president will say \"Trump\" or \"he,\" and an additional 17 times that he will say \"his\" or \"him\" in reference to the president \u2014  making a total of 101 Trump mentions. CBS News White House producer Fin Gomez\u00a0confirmed\u00a0earlier today that an internal poll conducted by Mr. Trump's reelection campaign found Mr. Trump trailing Biden in some key battleground states in a hypothetical general election matchup, according to two sources with knowledge of the poll.\u00a0 The campaign also found Biden doing well in states Mr. Trump won in 2016 and would need to win again to ensure reelection to a second term. The poll was conducted by campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio, and its findings were first reported by\u00a0The New York Times. The poll found Biden doing well across a broad swath of the country, including Rust Belt states like Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, as well as Florida, North Carolina and Arizona. A number of public polls have shown Biden leading the president, including a\u00a0Quinnipiac University national survey\u00a0released Tuesday that found Biden ahead 53% to 40%.\u00a0 Read more about the internal poll\u00a0here. MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG:\u00a0Buttigieg gave his most substantive\u00a0speech\u00a0to date Tuesday focused on foreign policy and national security.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says Buttigieg criticized the Trump administration's foreign policy approach, called for a repeal of the authorization of use of military force (AUMF) and commented on the Iran Nuclear Deal and North Korea.\u00a0 On the AUMF, Buttigieg said, \"If members of our military can find the courage to deploy to a war zone, our members of Congress ought to be able to summon the courage to take tough votes on war and peace.\" He also said he would recommit the U.S. to the Iran nuclear deal, would not \"exchange love letters\" with North Korea and argued the U.S. \"must be ready to deter\" Russian election interference through \"diplomatic, economic and even cyber tools and information operations.\"\u00a0 CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson\u00a0also notes that Buttigieg's speech offered no policy on Afghanistan, even though the\u00a0The Associated Press reports\u00a0an ISIS affiliate is growing in the country. Authorities have made at least eight arrests in the U.S. linked to the ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan, and recent attacks in Kabul could be \"practice runs\" for even bigger attacks in Europe and the U.S., a U.S. intelligence official told The AP. A campaign aide tells CBS News that Buttigieg was working on this speech for weeks and has a volunteer team of 100 foreign policy experts. This team is led by Doug Wilson and Ned Price is also on the team. The campaign also sought input from the veterans advocacy group VoteVets.\u00a0 Separately,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0has confirmed that the chair of Stonyfield Organic, Gary Hirshberg, will host a fundraiser for Buttigieg at his home in Holderness, New Hampshire, on July 11.\u00a0 Tickets are billed at $2,800 per person.\u00a0 IN THE MIDDLE:\u00a0In Iowa, unsuccessful Democratic House candidate J.D. Scholten has\u00a0penned an op-ed\u00a0in The Gazette about alleged handouts to the oil industry that are hurting Iowans.\u00a0Ellee Watson\u00a0says Scholten has not ruled out running against incumbent Republican Sen. Joni Ernst even though both EMILY's List and the DSCC have endorsed Theresa Greenfield. The op-ed lauds President George W. Bush for knowing how to create jobs in the Midwest. OUT WEST:\u00a0Two leaders of Latino community organizing groups tell\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0that they agree with a Nevada immigrant rights leader who\u00a0recently told\u00a0Politico that most candidates have done little more than \"fly-ins to come and take pictures with popular Dreamers and go to eat tacos or whatever.\" For months, they say only four campaigns have proactively engaged with them: Sec. Julian Castro, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Bernie Sanders. DIGITAL SPENDING:\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0continues to crush Democratic candidates in online ad spending says\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ben Mitchell. His campaign and its affiliated PAC have spent more than $10 million on Facebook and Google ads since the start of 2019 \u2014 more than the next four Democratic spenders combined (Warren, Harris, Biden and Sanders). The president's campaign largely builds ads around him \u2014 recent examples include asking voters to \"sign his birthday card\" (email harvesting), or \"enter to win a dinner with Trump\" (donation solicitation), but recently he's started fundraising off of supposed online censorship of conservatives and anti-conservative bias on college campuses. On the Democratic side, most of the candidates continue to ask for help reaching fundraising targets, but there's been a notable shift in the messages of Harris and Biden. Biden blanketed Facebook with $110,000 in ads exclusively about his new climate change plan, a sign that the former VP is working hard to convince voters he's strong on an issue that's proving increasingly important in this primary. Harris continues to lean into her role as a former prosecutor, running ads featuring her speech at the Iowa Democrats Hall of Fame dinner where she talked about \"a rap sheet of evidence\" against the president and that she will prosecute the \"fraud\" case against him.",

            "article_content": "Cutting down interstate 93 in a Winnebago Sightseer, Cory Booker rattles off a list of authors on his Audible queue\u2014Michael Lewis, Jon Meacham, Cornel West. \"I don't read fiction,\" Booker interjects on his Granite State RV tour. The candidate absorbs a mix of scripture and biography \u2013 reminders, he contends, that the \"fairer eye of history\" will \"look askance in a negative way at what has been done.\" Poised in a beige recliner inexplicably glued to the trailer floor, Booker leans in. \"Everything from trying to do a Muslim ban to throwing children in cages to separating families, is a kind of constant moral vandalism.\" \"The people we make monuments to,\" Booker contends, \"sometimes we can distort them.\" The bus stops at a red light as the analogy lurches to present day. \"I think the leaders who are seen as the greatest in this country are the leaders who are united. The leaders that elevated Americans, not denigrated them. So I just don't see this president faring well in the rearview of our generations.\" Booker flits from foreign policy (we should not move back the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem) to natural gas (we need to electrify transportation but can't just flip a switch) to D.C. statehood (he's all for it). Noticeably absent from the senator's policy deliberations are the words \"Donald Trump,\" a proper noun that does not surface over the course of a 32 minute conversation spanning 25 miles. Also noticeably absent from his campaign has been a breakout moment. The 50-year-old former Rhodes Scholar is among the score of presidential contenders polling in low-single digits both\u00a0nationally\u00a0and in\u00a0New Hampshire. Earning 72,000 new donors in the second quarter, Booker raised $4.5 million, a dip in performance from last quarter's $5.1 million. At a rally in Nashua, campaign staff announces a Fox News South Carolina poll qualifies the New Jersey senator for the September debate stage, but solicits donations to meet the 130,000 unique donor threshold he has still not met.\u00a0An Economist/YouGov poll\u00a0released last week found 35% of voters do not have an opinion of Mr. Booker, a plurality that outstrips his favorability rating among respondents. The survey has him mired at 1% support overall. As the Winnebago hooks right, Booker braces himself on the door. There are more seatbelts in his stump speech than this RV. \"The auto manufacturers fought seat belts,\" Booker exclaims at a house party in Exeter, responding to a question about carbon tax. \"They fought seat belts. There's so many things that corporations tell us they can't do until they have to.\" Booker's stump typically targets the president just once and at the top. \"I'm going to vent to you guys a little,\" Booker says aloud to about 250 voters congregated on picnic blankets. \"The number one polling issue right now is, 'I want to beat Donald Trump.' And I'm going to tell you now, I think we should have bigger aspirations than that.\" Over the course of a 45 minute refrain, the Senator recites dozens of historical references in a journey that travels backwards over time from the Birmingham Church Bombing to Genesis 37:19 (\"Here comes that dreamer!\"). Talk of Bull Connor, McCarthyism and Father Coughlin turns to digressions on Bloody Sunday, the Edmund Pettus Bridge and John Lewis. The historical allusions continue: Ella Baker, Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, Susan B. Anthony, the Birmingham Church Bombing, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, D-Day and the Lorraine Motel. \"So I just want you to know,\" Booker says back on the bus, \"I may be a former All-American football player and a big jock. But I'm also a big nerd,\" the senator laughs. \"All my life I've been I feel history really informs the present situation. And when you hear the rhetoric of this president, is the same rhetoric of that was used by the Know-Nothing Party.\" Booker pauses. \"We overcame this in the past, and we can overcome it again.\" Asked if his campaign road trip, complete with gaggles of journalists hopping on and off between retail stops, conjures images of the late Sen. John McCain's \"Straight Talk Express,\" Booker's smile fades. \"I reflect on John McCain all the time,\" he says. \"Not about campaigning. Just missing him.\" He pauses. \"He was someone who stood up against torture, was willing to take on campaign finance. He was very good to me in helping me learn the Senate. He was very much a mentor to me.\" In the driver's seat, senior advisor Jim Demers double checks directions. The veteran Granite State political operative and former New Hampshire campaign co-chairman for Barack Obama quips he was \"with the Booker campaign before Cory was,\" pledging his support before the candidate's Newark announcement. Despite his low polling, Booker's team here is large and experienced. Party leaders told prospective presidential candidates to not visit New Hampshire ahead of the 2018 midterms, an instruction Booker ignored, instead crisscrossing the state to raise money for local candidates. The visits translated to goodwill among state officials when he announced months later. And Booker now commands nearly 30 New Hampshire organizers, three field offices, ten interns and nine endorsements \u2013 including coveted backings from Sens. Jon Morgan and David Watters, the only two members of the state Senate to endorse anyone so far. Demers recalls his first time he caught a glimpse of Cory Booker, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton here in 2016. \"I saw several things I thought really fit with New Hampshire politics. He really enjoys campaigning, and he really thrives on that personal interaction.\" Reflecting on ground game, Demers adds, \"On election day, it's all about get out the vote. And we'll have one of the best campaigns going in this state so we can do exactly what Obama did in the 2008 the campaign.\" Obama, it should be noted, lost the 2008 New Hampshire primary. A community garden greets visitors to his campaign headquarters in Manchester. A red door opens to the \"selfie wall,\" adorned with post-it notes reading \"justice for all\" and \"lead with love.\" The word \"love\" appears beyond office walls. It's a term employed in the senator's stump speech, his everyday conversation, and scattered throughout his 2016 memoir \u2013 126 times to be exact. Asked if love wins in 2020, Booker's New Hampshire state director Erin Turmelle smiles. \"This is a question that I feel like is getting asked a lot,\" the former New Hampshire Democratic official notes. \"While some people might call that love, I call it unity. And we're seeing it resonate with voters across the state.\" Amid the selfie line at Booker's house party in Rockingham County over the weekend, words like \"heart\" and \"kind\" reverberate among Granite Staters debating their presidential shortlists. \"The next person has to send a positive message, but also show that he's strong enough to fight President Trump,\" physician Al Vogel states. \"Can he refute the viciousness and the nastiness and the lies?\" \"This is not a 'Kumbaya' thing,\" former marketing director Jan Phelps, a Booker supporter, says. \"He's not going to be lighting incense in the White House and calling girl scouts together. But he's lending the brains and ability to inspire.\" Back in the van, Booker wraps up the conversation. \"I'm just going to be my authentic self with this election,\" he shrugs. \"I don't care if the polls tell you this or that.\" While canvassing Manchester's ward 8 for local Mayor Joyce Craig, Booker saunters through streets, pausing once to record a video for Instagram and twice to apologize to neighbors for the gaggle of reporters crossing his wake. \"Look at the grass, they're stepping all over it,\" Booker quips. \"That's why Trump calls them the enemy of the people.\"\u00a0 Bryan Patriquin emerges from his garage to accept a handshake and offer up the story of his last presidential candidate encounter. \"Chris Christie,\" the 28-year old grad student recounts to the senator. Booker chuckles, lifting his iPhone out of his pocket to reveal a text message sent from his \"great friend,\" the former Governor of New Jersey, earlier that morning. \"That's an essay,\" Patriquin says, eyebrows raised. \"That's not even a text. That warrants a call back.\" Stashing the cell, Booker vows to do so later. The New Jersey lawmaker points a finger towards Patriquin's tattoo. \"What's it say?\" Patriquin rotates his forearm. \"To thine own self be true,\" he recites. \"It's a quote from the play Hamlet.\" Booker nods. \"Yeah, I love that play.\" He pauses. \"And I love that quote.\" CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

Pelosi called the president \"a coward\" and \"cruel,\" but she said she still prays for him \u2014 and she warned the reporter, \"Don't mess with me.\" As Pelosi walked out of her weekly press conference \u2014 soon after announcing that the Democrat-controlled House will begin drafting impeachment articles against Mr. Trump \u2014 Sinclair Broadcasting reporter James Rosen called out, \"Do you hate the president, Madam Speaker?\" The question stopped Pelosi in her tracks. She turned to face Rosen directly. \"I don't hate anybody,\" she said, pointing at him. \"I don't hate anybody. Not anybody in the world.\" Rosen pushed back on Pelosi saying he had \"accused\" her of hating the president. He pointed out that Rep. Doug Collins (R-Georgia) claimed during Wednesday's impeachment hearing that Democrats want to impeach the president simply because they don't like him. Pelosi then returned to her podium. \"I think the president is a coward when it comes to helping our kids who are afraid of gun violence,\" she said. \"I think he is cruel when he doesn't deal with helping our Dreamers, of which we are very proud. I think he's in denial about the climate crisis.\" But those issues, she said, can be resolved in an election. She argued the impeachment process was about the Constitution and the president allegedly violating his oath of office. \"As a Catholic, I resent you're using the word hate in a sentence that addresses me,\" Pelosi said. \"I don't hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love and always pray for the president. And I still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time.\" \"So don't mess with me when it comes to words like that,\" she concluded. She then left the room. After the press conference, Rosen retweeted a Fox News Radio journalist who defended his question, writing, \"Questioning leaders isn't always comfortable.\" President Trump responded with a tweet saying Pelosi \"just had a nervous fit\" and that he doesn't \"believe\" that she prays for him.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0reports that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders today sought to explain and defend his political ideology \u2013 democratic socialism. \u00a0 \"That is the difference between Donald Trump and me,\" Sanders said in a speech at George Washington University. \"He believes in corporate socialism for the rich and powerful, I believe in a democratic socialism that works for the working families of this country.\" Sanders is running for the Democratic nomination, but he's identified as a socialist since being elected to Congress in the 1990s. Since his 2016 presidential campaign, his views \u2014 especially to expand the Medicare program \u2014 have become more mainstream. Now, Republicans and President Trump talk about socialism on a daily basis, eager to cast Democrats as out of step. But\u00a0CBS News\u00a0White House producer Fin Gomez\u00a0has learned that polling conducted by the Trump campaign shows Sanders might be catching on. He leads the President in four states Mr. Trump won in 2016 \u2013 Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Among Democrats, Sanders is running second to frontrunner Joe Biden. Lesser known, more moderate Democratic presidential contenders are warning their party not to embrace Sanders and his ideas. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN:\u00a0If there was any worry that Biden would continue to skip out on the large gatherings of Democrats, those complaints may be dispelled, as his campaign tells\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0he has committed to attending the 2019 Polk County Democrats Steak Fry in September. The Iowa gathering was previously known as the Harkin Steak Fry, after the former Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who hosted the event for almost 40 years while in office. Biden, like the majority of the other presidential contenders, is expected to meet, greet and eat his way through the August Iowa State Fair, as well. CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0was with Biden on the final two stops of his latest Iowa swing on Wednesday. At his stop in Clinton, Biden confirmed to CBS News that his son Hunter got married again. During that appearance in Clinton, Biden focused on health care, education and curing cancer. He teased a major speech coming soon before talking about cancer. He also said this about finding a cure: \"We're not going to cure all cancer, but we can fundamentally change cancer. We can cure some cancers and we can be in position where we can fundamentally alter and prevent as well as deal with making it a chronic disease and not a life threatening disease.\"\u00a0 During a stop at the Tasty Cafe in Eldridge earlier in the day, he talked about democratic socialism and preparing for the upcoming debates. Reacting to Sanders' speech, Biden said, \"I think Bernie means what he says.\" He said the presidential candidates are mostly aligned but have some disagreements. He added: \"I won't comment on Bernie's characterization of who or what he is. He's sincere about what he thinks and I think he should go out and say it.\" He also reiterated that calling the upcoming DNC presidential debates \"debates\" is an \"exaggeration\" because there isn't much time for candidates to speak. MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG:\u00a0Wednesday marks three years since the Orlando Pulse Nightclub shooting, and the South Bend mayor sent an email to supporters saying: \"It was an attack on all of us. It was an attack on individuals expressing their sexuality, their heritage, their gender, and their freedom.\"\u00a0 In the email,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says Buttigieg urged Congress to pass universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. \"Evil flows from peoples' ability to see another human being as something other than a person; good comes from the ability to see and treasure another's humanity as one's own,\" Buttigieg said. \"That's also called love, and love is going to win.\" SEN. KAMALA HARRIS:\u00a0On Wednesday, Harris introduced a policy proposal to revive DACA, which President Trump ended in 2017, and provide recipients or \"DREAMers\" with a pathway to citizenship through various executive actions. CBS News campaign reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0says this is the California senator's third policy proposal as a presidential candidate that calls for executive action. GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER: Ramirez\u00a0also reports says that the former Colorado governor is giving a rebuttal on Thursday to Sanders' speech on democratic socialism.\u00a0 \"While Sanders has attacked those in the center for preaching incrementalism, the reality is that pragmatists don't say 'no' to big ideas, they figure out how to actually get them done. While government plays a vital role in tackling big challenges, it has rarely been successful alone,\" Hickenlooper plans to say Thursday, according to his prepared remarks. This comment and others are part of a message Hickenlooper has been repeating (and got booed for in California): \"Democrats must say loudly and clearly that we are not socialists. If we do not, we will end up reelecting the worst president in our country's history.\" BETO O'ROURKE: CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry and CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0report that Beto O'Rourke released his LGBTQ+ Equality Plan today calling for executive actions, working with Congress and working with our allies globally to ensure equality for members of that community. \u00a0 The plan includes repealing Mr. Trump's transgender military ban and passing the Equality Act to \"ensure LGBTQ+ people may fully participate in public life without discrimination in employment, housing and access to public spaces.\" O'Rourke says as president he would instruct his Justice Department to investigate the murders of trans women, especially women of color. Beto told\u00a0Perry\u00a0\"transgender women of color helped to inform the proposal\" and named activist Jeynce Poindexter as someone who helped him craft this plan. CBS News spoke to the former Texas congressman during a 5k Pride Run in New York City Wednesday. O'Rourke was asked during the run if he would vote for New York Mayor Bill De Blasio if he weren't also running for president. His response? \"Probably not, to be honest. But I think he is a good person who is doing his best for this city and this country.\" SEN. BERNIE SANDERS:\u00a0The Vermont senator's speech in Washington was a full-throated defense of democratic socialism today, says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. Here's some context to remember: Here's why\u00a0Korte\u00a0says this matters:\u00a0We are witnessing a distinguishing moment in this Democratic primary. There is division in the field between moderates and progressives.\u00a0 For Sanders, he is seeing \"progressive\" and raising \"democratic socialism.\" Biden is arguing that the system is broken because Mr. Trump is a clog. Once the president leaves office, the system will function properly again.\u00a0 Sanders says the system is fundamentally rigged against the working man \u2014 that the engineering of our country must be restructured to move forward. One requires superficial reworking, the other a deeply rooted political revolution. We'll see what voters prefer.\u00a0 ENDORSEMENTS:\u00a0Anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony's List gave its first Senate endorsement of the 2020 cycle to Senator Thom Tillis this morning, says\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson. The group has also endorsed Dr. Joan Perry who is running in the Republican primary runoff on July 9 for North Carolina's third Congressional District. The abortion debate in North Carolina is front and center after the Republican state assembly failed to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's veto on a heartbeat bill, and Planned Parenthood is opening in Charlotte this month, making it the fourth abortion clinic in the state.\u00a0 IN THE POLLS:\u00a0A new\u00a0Monmouth University poll\u00a0out of Nevada has Biden leading the pack of Democratic presidential hopefuls at 36%, says Ewall-Wice. He's followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 19% and Sanders at 13%. Buttigieg is polling fourth with 7%, and Harris rounds out the top five at 6%. While you can't make too much of Warren pulling ahead of Sanders with the 5.1% margin of error, our polling unit says the poll does appear in line with other surveys they've seen with an increase in support for Warren recently. Of note, the poll did not move the bar on how many candidates met the polling threshold for the first Democratic presidential debates, which by CBS News' count currently stands at 20. JUST FOR FUN:\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says he has driven\u00a0MORE THAN 1,000 MILES\u00a0in his rental car in\u00a0JUST ONE WEEK\u00a0while covering the 2020 presidential candidates!",

            "article_content": "Cedar Rapids \u2014 There were so many Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa on Sunday that they were quite literally running into each other \u2014 on the street, in elevators, and in hallways and hotel lobbies. In total, 19 White House hopefuls descended upon the DoubleTree Hotel and Convention Complex for the Iowa Democratic Party Hall of Fame. They came to the event with one mission: to make their case to voters why they are best equipped to take on Donald Trump. The president will also visit the state Tuesday for a party fundraiser.  The pep rally-type gathering came as a new poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers found former Vice President Joe Biden leading the pack, but with evidence that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are surging in the Hawkeye State. Among Democrats planning to caucus in person in February, 65% said defeating Mr. Trump was a greater priority than someone who aligned with their views on issues.  Biden was notably absent from the festivities attending his granddaughter's graduation, though he plans to campaign in the state Tuesday and Wednesday. But he was on the minds of some of the candidates in attendance. \u00a0 Buttigieg said Democrats won't win by \"playing it safe\" or by promising a return to normalcy. \u00a0\"We are where we are because normal broke,\" he said, in what was seen as a dig at the former vice president. Warren noted her steady efforts in the state, drawing subtle contrasts with Biden.\u00a0 \"I'm not spending my time with high dollar donors and with corporate lobbyists. I'm spending my time with you. That's how we build grassroots movement in America,\" said Warren, who was the first candidate to kick off her campaign in Iowa in January. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders took aim at Biden's appeal to moderation. \"I understand that there are some well-intentioned Democrats and candidates who believe that the best way forward is a 'middle ground' strategy that antagonizes no one, that stands up to nobody and that changes nothing,\" he said. \"In my view, that approach is not just bad public policy, but it is a failed political strategy that I fear could end up with the reelection of Donald Trump.\" Sanders, who is slated to give a speech in defense of democratic socialism on Wednesday, also invited some criticism from fellow candidates trying to break through. \"We need a dreamer but also a doer. We must present a bold vision for the future but we must also acknowledge that the most effective attack the Republicans can level against us is one of socialism,\" said former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. When asked by CBS News about Sanders' dismissal of a middle ground strategy, Hickenlooper countered by asking whether Sanders had accomplished anything in Congress. Others focused their efforts squarely on Mr. Trump. California Sen. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor, said the president had \"defrauded the American people.\" \"I'm here to ask for your support because I am prepared to make the case for America and to prosecute the case against Donald Trump,\" she said.  New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said he was running for president \"because we can't take four more years of Donald Trump.\" But, he said, \"beating Donald Trump is the floor \u2014 it is not the ceiling... We can't let this election be about what we are against. It must be about what we are for, who we are for.\" Booker has one of the most extensive ground operations in the state and a loud cheering section in Cedar Rapids, but registered at 1% in the latest Iowa poll.  New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who is also struggling to break through despite having campaigned throughout Iowa, said the race \"is a marathon not a sprint. People don't know who I am yet. But I win... If you looked at anyone ahead at this point they were not the winners. I know I have time.\" Voters and activists here say that while the field is starting to form into tiers, it is still a fluid race. \"I do see a lot of enthusiasm for fresh faces,\" said Sarah Hogan, a retired school teacher from Delmar, who said Harris, Buttigieg, and Beto O'Rourke has captured the attention of Iowa voters.  \"What are they fighting for, who are they fighting for, and can they get it done,\" is how Jim Eliason, chair of the Buena Vista County Democrats, described how he will be assessing the candidates. But defeating Mr. Trump is \"probably the first priority, because the candidates' positions are relatively similar.\"  Ross Wilbur, former Mayor of Iowa City, said he was deciding between Harris and Booker. \"We are looking for someone to inspire us, we are looking for someone who can deliver, and we are looking for someone with tenacity,\" he said. \"Our Democracy will not work if we have someone in office who is acting outside of the law. So that's why it's critical that we make sure Donald Trump is a one term president.\" Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper that aired Sunday, March 10, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: And now the \"biggest name in the race\" joins us live from Austin. Governor, welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" GOVERNOR JOHN HICKENLOOPER: Thanks for having me on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it a good idea to do what Senator Warren is advocating there with breaking up big tech companies? GOV. HICKENLOOPER: Well I think you've got to look at the environment and- and how the system is working. And for you know-- for several decades now, increasingly, people in the middle class and poor people in this country haven't had the security and opportunity that our economic system used to create for them. So what is the reason why we're seeing such a large number decline in the number of startups? People starting businesses? And maybe some of that is due to these large companies that, you know, usually when someone's going to start a business they're already a successful employee somewhere. Maybe they're looking at that landscape and saying, \"Ah. These companies are too big I can't get in.\" \u00a0 And I think that's one of the arguments that she's trying to make. We have to make sure that we have a competitive system whereby little guys feel they've got an in--an honest, decent chance to succeed. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do think tech companies have too much influence over the economy? GOV. HICKENLOOPER: No I'm-- what I'm saying is that they are, in many circumstances, becoming so large they make it harder for small companies to compete. I'm not-- again to make a blanket statement about all tech companies, you know they're too big, I think that would be a- a little bit over, going too far. But I do think it's legitimate to say, how do we make sure that we have more competition in such a way that we encourage, you know, people to start their own businesses?\u00a0 That's what job creation happens is- is when you get small businesses-- you know, people like me. I got laid off and I ended up starting, first one restaurant company, then another restaurant company then, you know I took old warehouses and turned them into loft projects. But we created thousands of jobs in that process and we're able to, you know, stimulate a whole part of Denver and- and others, you know, cities and towns across the Midwest. That's what drives this country and always has and- and we're seeing a decline in the number of people willing to start up businesses. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well I- I want to offer you the chance to clear something up here because you did an interview earlier in the week where you were asked three times if you would call yourself a proud capitalist and you wouldn't directly answer the question. It led Howard Schultz, who's possibly a candidate to say, \"If even a successful businessman and entrepreneur like Governor Hickenlooper can't openly support capitalism the Democratic primary, it's clear this is Senator Sanders' party now.\" Why are you uncomfortable calling yourself a proud capitalist? GOV. HICKENLOOPER: I've been-- the point I was making is that we defined people by these labels that- that often have all kinds of associations and baggage with them in that sense. Do I believe in small business? Of course I believe in small business. I started probably more than 20 different small businesses. I'd have-- in one year I'd have over a million customers. I understand that. But what's happening-- I think it's kind of a silly question. We should be looking at some of the reasons be- behind why we have less and less start ups. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. GOV. HICKENLOOPER: We should look at of the reasons why, you know, more and more people aren't wanting to start a business. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. But you understand that-- GOV. HICKENLOOPER: But-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --it is a main Republican talking point to label Democrats right now as anti-business socialists. GOV. HICKENLOOPER: Right? But that's ridiculous, obviously there are-- MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0So you would reject that. GOV. HICKENLOOPER: --the Democratic party is a big tent. MARGARET BRENNAN: You reject that label. GOV. HICKENLOOPER: Yes. Absolutely. I think that's not accurate. And I think that, as your interview with Elizabeth Warren showed, there are all kinds of- of- of different people making up the Democratic Party. Do I believe in- in free markets? Do I believe that, you know, you put capital to work to- to create jobs and- and improve your community? You know back when I was a kid, businesses understood the part of their job wasn't just to make as much profit as they could but it was to create the community. Once you get back into these labels, am I a capitalist? Am I a socialist? How much of how much of a capitalist I am I versus how much of a socialist? That becomes kind of silly doesn't it? MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- GOV. HICKENLOOPER: I mean, MARGARET BRENNAN: If- GOV. HICKENLOOPER: In a funny way-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The other candidates were comfortable answering the question so I wanted to offer you a chance to- to answer it. \u00a0understand you're not comfortable directly answering GOV.. HICKENLOOPER: I-I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But I want to move on to some-- GOV HICKENLOOPER: Well I-I'm comfortable. I'm hap-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. GOV. HICKENLOOPER: Let me just- I'm happy to say I'm a capitalist but I think at a certain point the labels do nothing but divide us. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOV. HICKENLOOPER: What I'm trying to build this campaign around, is to say that as a country we've got to stop finding every excuse to divide ourselves-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Point taken. GOV. HICKENLOOPER: And begin working together because we've got some big issues to make. MARGARET BRENNAN: Point taken. In terms of your platform. I understand you support universal health care not necessarily Medicaid for all- Medicare for all. You've supported some free trade deals in the past like NAFTA. You've touted your executive experience in a field full of legislators here. You don't like labels but you sound like more of a centrist. How do you keep the Democratic party from splintering further? GOV. HICKENLOOPER: Well try- if I've tried to avoid this all the labeling that goes on. You know, I mean, I'm running for president because I believe I could beat Donald Trump but \u00a0I also believe that can bring us together on the other side and begin getting stuff done. And that's one thing I think that I bring to the table is I'm a doer. I'm not someone who's- I mean I'm a dreamer too and I- I believe in big visions. We've done some amazing things in Colorado. I mean we've almost got universal health care coverage in Colorado now. We've addressed some of the biggest root causes of climate change. We've taken this- our economy from 40th in job creation to being the number one economy in the country for the last couple of years. Those are things that I think should be models on who the- you what the next president needs to be able to demonstrate that they can do things. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, Governor thank you very much for joining us.",

I'm John Dickerson and this is FACE THE NATION. It's been a quiet Thanksgiving week in Washington, which has meant fewer news alerts and a little more room for tradition. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Today I will issue a pardon to a pair of very handsome birds. JOHN DICKERSON: But the President couldn't stay entirely away from the topic that's been dominating the headlines. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They've already received subpoenas to appear in Adam Schiff's basement on Thursday. JOHN DICKERSON: The turkeys retired to a safe house and President Trump then made a surprise trip to Afghanistan, honoring another tradition by serving holiday dinner to American troops. It wasn't the only surprise. He also declared that the U.S. was back in peace talks with the Taliban. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Taliban wants to make a deal, and we're meeting with them, and we're saying it has to be a ceasefire. They didn't want to do a ceasefire, but now they do want to do a ceasefire. JOHN DICKERSON: It was an announcement that confused many, including the Afghan government and the Taliban, who nevertheless suggested they were willing to start talks again. JOE BIDEN: It's like he's playing monopolism. For the sake of the country I hope he accidentally gets it right. JOHN DICKERSON: Here at FACE THE NATION, we'll honor our own Thanksgiving tradition where we'll talk with several of our favorite authors and historians about the presidency, politics, and patriotism. Plus, as some 2020 Democrats spend their holidays looking for votes in Iowa--  CORY BOOKER (Campaign Ad): I'm here today because of love. JOHN DICKERSON: --New Jersey Senator Cory Booker is one candidate searching for something more meaningful. CORY BOOKER (Campaign Ad): The truth of America is that we win when we come together and show the best of who we are. JOHN DICKERSON: But is that vision possible? As the country and Washington prepare to get back to business. We'll talk with Senator Booker. And we'll have political analysis on all the news of the week just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Margaret is off today. The House Intelligence Committee announced last night that their impeachment inquiry report will be ready tomorrow. Then Tuesday the full committee will vote on whether or not to proceed to the next step, which is asking the Judiciary Committee to look at writing articles of impeachment against President Trump. We will discuss those developments, but we're also going to try to step back a little today to reflect on presidents and partisanship and the pace of an age where one development follows quickly on the heels of another. We will be-- we will begin, though, with campaign 2020. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker is one of the Democrats trying to win his party's nomination. And welcome, Senator. SENATOR CORY BOOKER (D-New Jersey/@CoryBooker/Democratic Presidential Candidate): John, it's good to be here. Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: Thanks for coming off the campaign trail for a nanosecond to join us. You have a new ad out and I want to talk about that ad and where we are in American politics today. Your ad comes at a time where your campaign is, you know, struggling to stay alive. You're trying to get on the next debate stage. Your message in the ad, you talk about love and unity. You've talked about that throughout. Is that message not selling? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Well, it is in a sense that right now we see from local leaders in Iowa, New Hampshire, there's no candidate that has more endorsements than I do from folks that are on the ground trying to make things happen for American people. We see my favorabilities now number three in net favorability in Iowa. So it's working it's not translating to people choosing me in the polls. This is why we're pushing more ads and hope people will go to my website, make contributions so we can do more of that. But I didn't get in this election because of any other reason that I thought the most important thing we needed in this country is try to affirm that the lines that divide us are not as strong as the ties that bind us. I'm running for President because I think the next President, especially after this person, has to be a healer, has to get us back to putting indivisible back into this one nation under God, because I see this in Washington. We're so-- the partisanship is becoming tribalism. We're hating each other because we vote differently and-- and we're not going to be able to get the big things done that we need to get done, like facing down climate change, the health care crisis that still persists. You need new American majorities to get that. And you need a leader that can inspire the moral imagination of this country. JOHN DICKERSON: So President Obama had a version of that when he ran for-- for the presidency and he came to Washington. And by the time he left, he basically felt-- and the Republicans have their view about him, but he felt about the Republicans they were not willing partners. If he couldn't do it, things have gotten worse since, why is President Cory Booker going to be able to do it? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Well, two things. One is I'm glad you mentioned that he won with that message. I do think that we need the leader who can best inspire that Obama coalition. But number two is when I took over a city that was known for crime and corruption, I think most of the mayors before me were indicted and convicted. People told me all the things we could not do. And my-- my frustration was hearing all these things that people said couldn't be done. It undermined. It sort of was like a surrender to cynicism that I think we have to resist. So I-- I'm going to come to Washington and do things differently. I'm going to break norms like this President is doing to demean, degrade, and divide-- JOHN DICKERSON: What norm are you going to break that's going to make this city, calcified as it is, suddenly break open and a group hug? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Well, first of all, that's not what I'm looking for. I think our debates and our-- are important. There are going to have to be tough discussions. But this is what frustrates me. The majority of Americans agree on common sense gun safety reform. The majority of Americans agree on the need for massive infrastructure investment. The majority of Americans agree that we need to raise the minimum wage. This is the frustrating thing is that we have this wide berth on which we agree so our politics is not reflecting the people. And that's what I'm going to change as the next President of the United States. JOHN DICKERSON: Is your campaign facing a do-or-die moment in terms of getting on the debate stage? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: It-- it-- it is facing one of those moments where-- and people have responded to this before, that if you want me in this race, if you want my voice and my message, which is resonating, then-- then I need help. We need people to go to corybooker.com and contribute so that we can do what I see a lot of the billionaires in the race now doing, which is just running non-stop ads to boost their-- their poll numbers. I'm not taking corporate PAC money. I'm not taking a lot of the money-- I'm-- I'm running on individual contributions, and that's what we're going to need to keep doing. JOHN DICKERSON: President Obama a couple of weeks ago said the country is not really ready for revolution and that what he hears coming out of the Democratic race is maybe a little bit of too much change. Where do you come down on that? If-- if a Democrat is elected, it's going to be after four years of-- of President Trump, where there's been a lot of excitement. Is the country going to be ready for a lot of Democratic version of excitement? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Look, I-- I-- we need a inspiring, igniting leader next. Someone who can get folks energized because-- I'm here because of revolutions. The civil rights movement was a revolution. What happened at Seneca Falls was a revolution. But these are revolutions that are consistent and resonant with our founding ideals. Look, the Declaration of Independence, they knew that this was a nation that was an experiment. If you read that document at the end, they actually have a declaration of interdependence where they say that if America is going to make it, we have to mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. That's what I think we need this next revolution to be about, is about this understanding that our enemies, they literally-- I've read the intelligence reports, the Russians, the more we are divided against each-- ourselves, they are using strategies or social media platforms more to make us hate each other more. This next revolution has to be one where we understand we have common cause. If your kids don't have a great public school to go to, my kids are lesser off. We've got to understand that we're all in this together. JOHN DICKERSON: One last question I want to ask you. SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Please. JOHN DICKERSON: It's something you mentioned in the debate. You-- you said this in the debate, \"We lost in Wisconsin because of a massive diminution in the African-American vote. We need to have someone who can inspire African-Americans to the polls in record numbers.\" Polls show right now that Joe Biden gets forty-nine percent among African-Americans. That's thirty-four points better than his closest rival. SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: He seems to be doing exactly what you're saying. He is inspiring African-Americans, so who are you talking about? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Well, first of all, he's got the loyalty and voting right now because he's got a hundred percent name recognition and is our former vice president, but you know this, that Barack Obama was behind Hillary Clinton amongst black voters until he won in Iowa. This race, most people have not made up their mind, and as a guy who has shown statistically in New Jersey when I'm on the ballot, surges in African-American vote, I am confident I'm the best person in this race--not to just get the percent of the African-American vote, but to increase the base, increase the turnout in a significant way. That's the kind of leader we're going to need on the ticket in the next election. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Senator Cory Booker, thanks so much for being with us. SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Thank you, John. JOHN DICKERSON: Appreciate it. SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Thank you very much. JOHN DICKERSON: And we will be back in one minute with our political panel. Don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And we're back after a quick change with our political panel. Amy Walter is the national editor for The Cook Political Report, Jeffrey Goldberg is the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Ben Domenech is the publisher of The Federalist, and Jamal Simmons is a Democratic strategist who works for Hill.TV and he is also a CBS News political contributor. Welcome to all of you. And I don't know if you can hear the rain but it's-- AMY WALTER (Cook Political Report/@amyewalter): Yes. JOHN DICKERSON: --we're going to pour down opinions right now. Ben, I want to start with you the impeachments. We basically have known about this story for about eleven weeks. What is the defense of the President? Is it that he did nothing wrong or is it that he did something wrong but it's not impeachable? BEN DOMENECH (The Federalist/@bdomenech): I think that some Republicans are taking from column A and most Republicans are taking from column B. The response that you heard from Will Hurd just a couple of weeks ago after the hearings were winding up is one that I've heard from a lot of Republicans that say that they are uncomfortable with what the President did, but they don't believe that it rises to the level of impeachment. One of the things that I think has actually aided Republicans in this is that this has become more of a process story as it has gone along one where they can go into different rabbit holes and directions as opposed to maybe plowing ahead with the argument that the transcript itself is impeachable, which was something that we heard from Democrats early on. JOHN DICKERSON: Jamal, what Ben talks about the rabbit hole defense is what the Clinton impeachment folks did. They try and get to be everything but about whatever the main thing is. If a Democrat stopped somebody on the street and says this is the main thing, what is the main thing? JAMAL SIMMONS (Hill.TV/@JamalSimmons): The main thing is that the President of the United States tends to use national policy in whatever he does for his own personal benefit, not for the benefit of the country. And if you look at this not just in the Clinton example, unless you remember Bill Clinton took responsibility for what it is he did in August of 1998, which gave Democrats the permission to sort of lambaste him before that election, which Donald Trump is not going to do. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. JAMAL SIMMONS: But let's take it out of that context and look at more as the Hillary Clinton Benghazi investigation-- JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. JAMAL SIMMONS: --where the Republicans branded Hillary Clinton in the course of that Benghazi admis-- investigation, and she was never really fully able to get out from underneath that shadow that they cast over her in the process. JOHN DICKERSON: Clinton is saying wrong but not impeachable, Donald Trump has said done nothing wrong so far. JAMAL SIMMONS: Don't do that. He's-- he punishes you for trying to do that. JOHN DICKERSON: That's right. That's right. Amy, you were down in South Carolina, there were some ads running-- AMY WALTER: Yes. JOHN DICKERSON: --anti-impeachment ads running. Tell me against Joe Cunningham? AMY WALTER: He's a brand-new congressman from this district that Trump won easily. JOHN DICKERSON: He's a Democrat? AMY WALTER: He's a Democrat. If you are a Republican right now, your hope is it's putting people like Joe Cunningham who came in in this big wave in 2018, pledging to be something different, pledging to be bipartisan, a lot of what Senator Cory Booker was talking about, right? We're going to focus on the issues; we're going to break sort of this he said, she said in Washington and find solutions. Now, the knock on folks like Joe Cunningham and other the freshman is he said you were coming here to fix things, now you've just turned into a partisan Democrat just like Nancy Pelosi or whoever else in leadership. They're hoping that that's going to work out in the election in 2020. My guess is, by the time we are even in the spring or summer of 2020, we're not going to be talking about impeachment at all. And this is the most remarkable thing about this impeachment process is, this will be the third time in history a President of the United States will be impeached and I will bet you it's not an issue at all in the 2020 election. JOHN DICKERSON: So, Jeffrey, what Amy is saying, then, basically is this is just another thing after the last thing and it will be superseded by the other things. JEFFREY GOLDBERG (The Atlantic/@JeffreyGoldberg): A lot more things. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah, yeah. So that it seems to me works in the President's benefit. Which is, this is just another thing. It's the-- it's that, you know-- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Not only to his benefit, if he comes out a winner, he comes out a winner. I mean, he says I defeated this attempt to remove me that your-- your tribune to the sixty million plus people who voted for him. There was a concerted attempt to remove me and I was not removed, therefore, I am stronger now than I was before. And by the way going back to something you were talking about, you know, he-- the argument, the best Republican argument right now probably is this-- this motion that all foreign policy, all national security policy, all aid making is quid pro quo, right? But, of course, we want something back for the money that we give out. The difference here, of course is that-- that usually that is done on behalf of national interest, not personal interest, but he can muddy that very, very nicely if he-- if he tries hard. JAMAL SIMMONS: But, John, let's-- let's not get past this. Impeachment stains are really hard to washout. You know we have had three impeachment processes that occurred and neither Al Gore, Gerald Ford nor Horatio Seymour who was the Democratic nominee in 1960-- in 1868 were able to take the White House after their party-- the president of their party went through impeachment process, it's very hard. And with the Bill Clinton impeachment, while the Democrats were able to hold on to or win the Congress back, keep in mind, not just Al Gore, Hillary Clinton ran for President twice and wasn't able to get the White House. It's very hard. So we haven't seen an incumbent President run for election before. So we really just don't know how it works out. BEN DOMENECH: At the same-- at the same time I think it's impossible to say to Jeff's point that the President getting the approval of a bipartisan majority of the Senate against removing him from office, one which would include potentially the votes of Joe Manchin and-- and potentially other Democratic senators as well, is not something that he's going to point to and say, look, they've just have been trying to get me all along, this is all just a big, you know, hoax. AMY WALTER: Except the true-- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: And they lost and Iowa then lost-- AMY WALTER: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: It's all about losing your state from the Senate. AMY WALTER: Except that opinions of this President don't move no matter what happened. JAMAL SIMMONS: They don't. They don't. AMY WALTER: That's what I am saying that how you feel about Donald Trump will tell you how you feel about this impeachment process. If you have disliked him all along you think this process has been above board and it's exactly what Democrats should be doing. If you like him, you think that this process has been a witch hunt, and really very little that's going to come up between now and the election is going to change your opinion of that or of him. And so I don't know that it helps him necessarily to say, I won, because they are coming to get me. Opinions about him are-- he is as unpopular in many parts of America today as he was before the impeachment process started. And he is as popular in places where he was before the impeachment process started. JOHN DICKERSON: Jeffrey, you-- the Atlantic has a cover on the civil war and-- and how to avoid one-- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Mm-Hm. JOHN DICKERSON: --in this country. This seems to be ground zero for the moment, the civil war until the next-- we have the next fight over something else. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: What-- what's your-- what's your feeling about those larger clashing forces in America and how they play out-- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: --through this? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Impeachment is just a symptom of the Trump presidency, which is just a symptom of larger cultural and political divides, even regional divides in-- in some ways. Yeah. The-- the special issue of the Atlantic we did is-- is, we're not suggesting that it's 1860 right now or even 1850, we're just suggesting that demographic changes, change in the way we communicate with each other, changes in a whole raft of areas have made it harder and harder to think of this country as a unified force where Americans no longer (INDISTINCT) from Jim Mattis, Americas don't seem to have affection for each other in the way that they used to and we're just trying to understand that. And again, you know, Trump for all the-- the obsession that we have--we're talking about Trump today, Trump is a symptom of-- of larger issues, larger dislocations, larger changes in the way we talk to each other, larger ways in the way we understand common reality, what used to be a common reality. BEN DOMENECH: And there's downsides for the world of that type of divide within the American nation. As you look around the globe today, we see all sorts of different things happening. We see what's happening in Hong Kong, we see what's happening in Iran. We see what's happening in the degradation of the state of Mexico. We see North Korea. These are all areas where I think we should be focused on them. They're incredibly important and, yet, the focus in Washington has been on this impeachment battle and I think it's degraded the conversation that we ought to be having about these very important human rights issues. JAMAL SIMMONS: Well, you know, in 1964, Robert Kennedy went to convention floor and gave a speech about America being strong abroad so that we can handle our problems at home. It seems like now we are in the reverse. Even Kamala Harris has said this, America needs to deal with this racial and-- and economic issues at home and in order so we can be strong abroad, and until we not just deal with Donald Trump, but we deal with the economic dislocation of so many communities in this country, it just seems like we're never going to be able to assert the American leadership that we're all used to. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: We have managed over years to-- to do both things at the same time. We have been able to-- to project power, project our influence and also deal with some of the issues that we have now. We're in a unique position in that we seem totally paralyzed. Everybody knows we're paralyzed. JOHN DICKERSON: We're going to have to go out the door in a second, but, Amy, I'm going to give you the difficult task of--Dan Balz wrote today about the Democratic race. AMY WALTER: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: The Democratic presidential campaign has produced confusion rather than clarity. AMY WALTER: That's right. JOHN DICKERSON: In the forty seconds we have left, clarify what the state of the Democratic race is for us. AMY WALTER: The state of the Democratic race is that you have a national front-runner named Joe Biden, who's losing in the first two contests. And in traditionally the first-- the winner of the first two contests Iowa and New Hampshire on the Democratic side has gone on to win the Democratic nomination, where Joe Biden succeeds is in the next two states, Nevada and South Carolina, which are populated with more voters of color, and so we're in a situation right now where you have four candidates right now who have the prospect at least of being calling themselves a front-runner, but by the time we get through South Carolina, we could have none of them as the front-runner. In that, they all can claim a piece of it. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. Which is when Mike Bloomberg thinks he's going to turn the\u2026 AMY WALTER: That's right. JOHN DICKERSON: That's the end of it for all of us. AMY WALTER: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: Thanks to all of you. JAMAL SIMMONS: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back in a moment. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: For six years billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein has hosted dinners for lawmakers at the Library of Congress, each featuring a modern historian. Rubenstein has published a collection of the dialogues in The American Story: Conversations with Master Historians. We spoke with him last week and asked why knowing the past is so important to understanding the present. (Begin VT) DAVID RUBENSTEIN (The American Story): The theory of history is that we can learn from what we made mistakes about before, and what we did right before, and then maybe we can do better things in the future. Civilization is all about improving things and if we don't improve in the past, how are we really advancing civilization? JOHN DICKERSON: When members of Congress come to these gatherings, bipartisan, do you find that they ask questions with a specific intent because they want to use it in their own lives? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: It's like an era of good feelings when the dinners occur. There's no bickering. Members from the opposite parties sit together. Members in the opposite house sit together. And it's-- you wouldn't know how rancorous the atmosphere is in other parts of Washington, but it's like a time where they put a truce down and they come together. JOHN DICKERSON: Do you see anything or have the historians been able to give these members of Congress any guidance on how they can break out of what they all agree is a time of hyper partisanship? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I don't think the historians are trying to lecture members of Congress of what they should do. They're just saying, I wrote these books. Let me tell you about these great figures and you take the lessons away from them that you will. JOHN DICKERSON: Have you had a moment or a time in your career where the lessons of history have really been applicable? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, as a young man, when my hair was dark and I was much thinner, I worked in the White House under Jimmy Carter. I wish I had as much knowledge of history then as I do now. JOHN DICKERSON: He was a disrupter of the system. He had won the presidency when people didn't think he would. And they came to Washington saying, we're not going to do things the old way. Would a little lessons of history have been helpful to the Carter team when they came in? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, I think in hindsight, we made some mistakes and I would take the blame for it as long as-- as well as other people who were involved in the system as well. But we did some very good things. We did say we're going to shake up Washington. And-- and Jimmy Carter came up with a very unique idea. He said, I'm not a lawyer. I'm not from Washington. And that was unique at that time. And he kind of used that populist appeal. When we came to Washington, we probably didn't have as much breadth of knowledge of people who had served in Washington before. But in hindsight, President Carter was president for only four years and we did enormous number of things. And today, the amount of legislation we passed in that four-year period of time dwarfs what's getting done today. JOHN DICKERSON: One of the things you have asked these historians when you've talked to them is if you could talk to one former President and ask them a question, which one would it be? So for you what former President, if they were alive today, would you-- would you want to talk to him? What would you ask them? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: In my view, in our long history in this country, the greatest American, without doubt is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln held this country together because it wasn't obvious to people that the country should stay together. I'm not sure any other person who we elected President would say to the south, no, we're not going to let you go away. So I would ask him two questions if I had a chance to have dinner with him. One, why did you feel was so important to have the south stay as part of the country? Why not let it go away? And, secondly, were you convinced that ending slavery through the Emancipation Proclamation was the only way to win the war? And are you pleased that you ultimately freed the slaves? And why did you not do it earlier? JOHN DICKERSON: When you look at Lincoln, he came into that job with a kind of patchwork of experience and a lot of failures. What do you see in his background that-- that tells us about Lincoln's success? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: He probably didn't have more than a second-grade education. He taught himself how to read. He loved to read, but he really didn't have a classic college education. He didn't really go to law school. He took the people who were more likely to be president or presidential nominee of his party and he brought them together in his cabinet, and he really took the best of their knowledge. And in the end, those people idolized him. Abraham Lincoln's great talent was that he didn't take himself too seriously. He had a great sense of humor. He knew how to write extremely well. He had a way with words that really no President has really had since that time. JOHN DICKERSON: Which President, when you started becoming a presidential historian yourself and so interested in them, which one was the first one that you really got turned on to the presidency about? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think President Kennedy was somebody that took my generation and said, come in and give back to your country. PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY: Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country. (Crowd cheering and applauding) DAVID RUBENSTEIN: And it inspired me to go into public service. And many people in my generation were similarly inspired. JOHN DICKERSON: And you've dedicated your life to public service in one form or another. What do you think is the state of that notion in America, the ask not notion? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think Americans want to make the country a better country. But I think it's-- what has changed from President Kennedy's time is that many people think you can help your country as you can without having to go in the government service. There are so many NGOs today, so many ways to serve your country in nonprofit areas that do not require you to be on the government payroll. But I then also think many people in our country don't feel that government service is as noble a thing as it once was. And in fact, we tend to denigrate government servants much more than we do. JOHN DICKERSON: Is there danger-- DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Than-- than we should, I should say. JOHN DICKERSON: Is there a danger to that-- that-- DAVID RUBENSTEIN: There is. For example, it's very easy to make fun of members of Congress. And-- and you can always get a joke by making fun-- fun of members of Congress. They're relatively modestly paid. They have an incredible lifestyle in terms of how much work they have to put in. And they're under enormous amounts of pressures and we don't realize the burden they often face. But we-- you can still make fun of very few people in our country. You make fun of lawyers. You can make fun of private equity people. You might be able to make fun of members of Congress and you won't get criticized for making fun of members of Congress. But actually, they're pretty good public servants and we should honor them more. I think we should actually pay them more. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll have more from our interview when we come back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but we'll be right back with more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue with our conversation with David Rubenstein. (Begin VT) JOHN DICKERSON: You've had success in public sector, private sector, philanthropy. Let's say you were thrust into the job. As the President, what do you think the hardest part of the job would be? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I would want to surround myself with people who I thought had experience, who had the right motivations, were coming into public service because they wanted to help the country and not for any other purpose. I'd want to make sure I recognize that members of Congress are an equal branch of government and want to work cooperatively with them and also want to recognize that the Judiciary is an also an equal branch of government. And what it says also is a very important in terms of how the government is to be governed. But also the most important thing is persuading people to do things that you think are the right things to do. And you have persuade people by being honest with them, being forthright with them, bringing them along in a way I think makes people feel they are getting something from them-- from the negotiation. A good negotiation is one where both sides feel they are getting something. They are not completely happy with it, but they are getting something out of the-- out of it. JOHN DICKERSON: How do you think Donald Trump has done on that front? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, I think it's very difficult to judge a President this early, to be honest. I think most historians would say give me forty years after the presidency to evaluate whether the person has done a good or bad job. JOHN DICKERSON: Given what you know about the presidency, when you hear it talked about in presidential campaigns, is there a part of that conversation that you say, you know, this is nice, but it's really not what the job is? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, when you're running for President of United States, your job is to get elected to some extent and do so in a reasonably honorable way. You can't say things that are ridiculous, I think, but you should do so in a reasonably honorable way. But you have to-- to recognize that what people say in a campaign rarely can get implemented so easily. So if you say I want to have a certain type of tax, I want to change the law this way, it's not that easy to do. You have to deal with Congress. And so I think it would be a good idea if people were to propose things that are realistically possible and not-- not to ignore the impossibility of doing something great. But sometimes you have to have bold ideas and bold ideas are good, but sometimes some things are just not going to happen and you can get people excited about the prospect of it and you're really going to disappoint people. JOHN DICKERSON: If you could give the American story to every presidential candidate, what lesson would you hope they draw from it? DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I would say to all the presidential candidates, learn more about American history, learn about the things we've done right and wrong in the past. Do not think you have the sole knowledge of what's the right thing to do is and bring other people into the equation. Make sure you bring into the-- to your proposals about what you want to have done and what you're into your administration if you're elected. People that have a sense of history. Very often, many of our Presidents have met with historians because they want to learn what previous Presidents did. I think that's a good thing. And I think learning what our previous Presidents did, the good and bad, is a good way to-- to learn how to be a good President. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: Rubenstein's book was published by Simon & Schuster, a division of the CBS Corporation. The full interview is on our website facethenation.com. We will be back in a moment with our book panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We turn now to a conversation with four authors whose books focus on Presidents and patriotism in politics. Ruth Marcus is the author of a new book that looks at one party's mission to control the Supreme Court, \"Supreme Ambition: Brett Kavanaugh and the Conservative Takeover.\" Michael Duffy is the co-author of \"The Presidents Club: Inside the World's Most Exclusive Fraternity.\" Susan Page is the author of \"The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty\" and the upcoming \"Madam Speaker: Nancy Pelosi and the Arc of Power.\" Our final panelist, Jon Meacham joins us from Nashville. His latest book is \"The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels.\" It examines national divisions at critical times in our history. Jon, I am going to start with you. You wrote recently that this impeachment question tells us something larger. It's not just about a President, it tells us something about the country. So what are the stakes right now? JON MEACHAM (\"The Soul of America\"/@jmeacham): All that at moments of enormous existential crisis over the direction of the country. Andrew Johnson and the verdict of the Civil War, where we're really going to up-- act on the implications of the victory of-- of the Union victory at Appomattox. President Nixon was coming with Vietnam, and-- and the questions about the nature of-- of the country. In many ways, in fact, I think we can think of the modern founding of the country as 1964, '65 with the Civil Rights Act. We've only governed this particular polity for fifty-five years or so, and-- and Vietnam and-- and that era was a period of enormous tension. And the Clinton era was in a way a precursor to this one, where we were returning to an eighteenth and nineteenth-century system of partisan media. It was to some extent, a-- a battle over generational power. And now we face this wildly unconventional President who is actively and overtly putting all the norms that so many of us were accustomed to on trial. And so we have these forces in American life that are perennial, xenophobia, extremism, racism, nativism, isolationism. They ebb and they flow in American life, they always have. And right now they are flowing, the task of the country is to get them to ebb. JOHN DICKERSON: And, Ruth, what Jon describes and sets the table for there nicely, it feels like we had a bit of a preview of what we are going to see with impeachment hearing, which-- which is what you write about with the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation. Do you see those-- those parallels? RUTH MARCUS (Washington Post/@RuthMarcus/ Supreme Ambition): Indeed. And I think they are disturbing parallels that mainly involve the reflexive and automatic and unrelenting partisanship of our time, that-- that Jon and others have referred to. Republicans complain that we can't take impeachment now seriously because Democrats were talking about impeaching the President even before he was sworn in. Correct. Republicans claim that we couldn't take the allegations against Justice Kavanaugh seriously because Democrats were out to get him from the start and these only arose at the last minute. Correct. But in both situations the question is well were there serious allegations, are there serious allegations in the case of impeachment against the target of Democratic ire, and are we capable of taking those allegations seriously or do we so automatically go to our corners that we are not capable of rising above partisanship? I think that's a really open and serious question. JOHN DICKERSON: One, Michael, you wrote about--it's an extraordinary thing--Bill Clinton when he was going through this, called Richard Nixon. So the idea that-- that two Presidents across that period of time would have a conversation, I mean you-- you can't imagine Donald Trump calling Bill Clinton. MICHAEL DUFFY (Washington Post/\"The Presidents Club\"): No. I think Clinton-- Clinton admired Nixon's just resilience, the fact that he gutted it out, and yeah-- the famous quote from the Clinton impeachment experience was we'll just have to win this. When it was clear that he had done whatever he had done, we're just going to have to win this. And I think he looked to Nixon and Nixon's experience as a model because Nixon fought right up until the time the smoking gun came out. And then, of course, his party abandoned him. Both men were survivors and both men fought like the Dickens to hold on to power until they-- you know, in-- in Nixon's case couldn't. One other thing about that relationship, it would fall to Clinton, of course, to eulogize Nixon in 1994 when he finally died, twenty years after he left office. And-- and Clinton's famous remark at the eulogy was, \"May the days of judging Richard Nixon on just one, you-- you know, part of his life, be brought to a close,\" which, of course, was a benediction and a prayer for him and all Presidents. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. RUTH MARCUS: And are convenient, huh? JOHN DICKERSON: Yes. He was making an appeal for the long sweeping view. MICHAEL DUFFY: For-- and for all of the Presidents-- JOHN DICKERSON: Right. Right. MICHAEL DUFFY: --who would afterwards come. JOHN DICKERSON: Susan, I want to ask you about another part of this drama which has really struck me is that-- is during the-- the testimony from the House Intelligence Committee-- SUSAN PAGE (USA Today/@SusanPage): Mm-Hm. JOHN DICKERSON: --a lot of the witnesses did not just start with the facts of the case. They, you know, in writing we talked-- you know, talk about going up-- SUSAN PAGE: Mm-Hm. JOHN DICKERSON: --to thirty thousand feet, they talked about the role America plays in the world. They talked about their immigrant backgrounds. What did you make of that? SUSAN PAGE: You know this was a-- the-- the impeachment hearings were in many ways, kind of, a dispiriting episode because-- both because of the allegations being made and because of the partisan response to them. But I had-- had-- I thought it was inspirational to hear from these witnesses, career public servants who started by talking about their immigrant backgrounds. Two of them immigrants, one of them the child of immigrants, families that had fled-- Nazi Germany had fled the Soviet Union, had come here for greater economic opportunity, loss of a class structure, and they talked about how grateful they were to America for taking them in, giving them this opportunity. And that was one reason they had chosen the path of service that they had. I thought that was-- I thought that was the best moment. It was a reminder of what Americans want to protect about our country, that seems often just so battered in these times. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. In this room is not just the behavior of President, but-- but questions of bedrock basic American values-- SUSAN PAGE: Mm-Hm. JOHN DICKERSON: --that everybody is also fighting over. Jon, I want to get your thoughts about the task before the House Judiciary Committee this week, which is to start looking at the Constitution and what guidance it gives for this inquiry. What wisdom-- wisdom do you think that the document or that summer in Philadelphia should give us in terms of thinking about this? JON MEACHAM: The impeachment clause was added in part because George Mason of Virginia argued that, shall any man be above justice? That was the-- that was the central question. And the question that the framers tried to argue and-- and answer was that there had to be a check and a balance on the executive. The entire insight, remember, of the-- the guiding insight of the Constitution was that we would screw everything up. And we've done everything we can since then to prove them right. It's-- it's a fundamentally human document, and formed by a kind of Calvinistic insight that we would be driven by appetite, we would be driven by ambition, we were shaped by shortcoming and sin and, therefore, sovereignty had to be divided, power could not be-- all power could not be given to any one element in the republican, lowercase r, contract. And so impeachment was a hugely important element there. The article is very short. It's about treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. The latter phrase comes from the English common law. And as Gerald Ford, famously remarked, \"a high crime and misdemeanor\" is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives says it is at any given moment. And this generation, this group of members of Congress now has to face a genuine test, are they going to follow the facts or are they going to-- to use Ruth's phrase, are they going to reflexively be partisan and interpret reality not as they see it but as they wished to see it? JOHN DICKERSON: Ruth, one of the things is that-- that we still don't know what the actual position is, because you can say, well, there are these acts but they don't raise to the level of-- of high crimes and misdemeanors, but the President is saying these acts-- RUTH MARCUS: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: --weren't even bad in the first place. You've been studying the idea of originalism, the original public meaning of the Constitution. Does that give us any guidance here for how to interpret these mo-- this moment? RUTH MARCUS: The-- the guidance is very Freudian in the sense that it is really a political question that is up to the political branch. But, yes, the framers were entirely worried about precisely the kind of event that we're talking about here, foreign influence, the misuse of presidential power for public gain and political advantage, rather than for the public good. If-- if you were going to-- the question that I would have for Republicans is, if this does not rise to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor or look a lot like the \"Framers\" conception of bribery, what does? And the-- the thing that I would say that gives me some concern here, I think the facts are so serious that the House was really constitutionally obliged to launch an impeachment inquiry, but we have now gone through three of these in our lifetimes, and impeachment was supposed to be and it should be a breaking case of emergency inquiry, and now I worry that we will unleash it as just-- just another political tool. JOHN DICKERSON: And, Michael, it's happening in an election year which we haven't seen before. MICHAEL DUFFY (Washington Post/The Presidents Club): No, it's always in the past happened in a second term, at least in-- in-- in our lifetime. So this allows the Republicans to argue, somewhat justifiably that, look, we're going to have an election in a year, just wait, you can make up your decision and let the people decide and they're deploying that almost, you know, daily or hourly. That raises another thing about John's test (ph) of Madisonian democracy. We're all hyper-dosing on this stuff. And-- and, you know, depending on whether you are like us and you have to drink it every day or you are-- you are just following along informally can seem at times that this is the worst that the country has ever faced, but I suspect it between a whole number of 1777, 1863, 1932. There have been other difficult times. What's different now is that how we experiencing it, that we are-- we're self-arming for division because so much of the information we get is coming to us through our devices and those devices are weaponized to sort of alienate and divide us, and that is a difference in-- in-- certainly between this and the last impeachment and all the ones that have come before. And I think this is-- this is the test that Madisonian democracy that, you know, we're meant to, you know, think-- have our better angels work at all levels here, but at every turn, we are being fed information that is-- divides us rather than brings us together and that is a real test of whether we can survive. JOHN DICKERSON: And we're self-satisfying ourselves by-- by continuing to drink that ourselves. Susan, Michael just described the state of affairs. Nancy Pelosi didn't want to go down this impeachment road, felt like she had to. What-- what is the state of the Nancy Pelosi view of the world as she tries to hold on to power at a time that we're in, in this volatile moment? SUSAN PAGE (USA Today/@SusanPage/The Matriarch): Well, this is very much what Nancy Pelosi predicted would happen when she was holding off some Democratic instincts to impeach the President months ago, years ago, since soon after his election, which is it would be divisive for the country and you shouldn't go forward unless you could get bipartisan support. But then you had the Ukraine phone call come out, and I think at that point she determined-- she decided that you had no option as Ruth was saying, if not this, what would be impeachable, had to go forward. She has tried to keep the focus narrowly on the Ukraine matter to keep the timetable going incredibly fast, the speed of this impeachment inquiry is really quite breathtaking, with the idea that we're going to see articles of impeachment perhaps this week, we're going to see a vote of the House before the end of the year, and then it goes to the Senate. And I think the instinct in the Senate is also let's do this and get it off our plate. JOHN DICKERSON: Michael, before we go, I want to ask you about the 2020 election. I don't know whether when I worked with you or somebody when we were back at TIME Magazine said, every election is about one question, maybe they didn't say that but I'm going to-- what is the question of this election? MICHAEL DUFFY: Well, all elections are about, you know, hope or fear, and whether you-- or-- or about change and whether you hope for change or fear it. I think at the moment this is provisionally will be is-- whatever they think about impeachment in a year, given what Amy said in the previous segment, this will be a referendum on Donald Trump, no question, and impeachment may play into that, both sides think it's going to help them. That's what's so interesting. The Democrats think they have to push this through, and have this test and show that they have done it in order to help build their support in their base. Republicans, I think increasingly think this will build our base as well and turn out the people who believe Donald Trump. SUSAN PAGE: I-- I disagree. I think both parties think they hope it helps them. MICHAEL DUFFY: Mm-Hm. SUSAN PAGE: I think both parties fear it's going to hurt them. And I think at this point it is impossible to figure out exactly what the politics of this issue is going to be. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask the final question to you, Jon Meacham. David Rubenstein suggested it takes forty years before you can weigh in on a President. What's your view on that and we should let people know that you weighed in on George Herbert Walker Bush before that timeline. JON MEACHAM: Twenty-five-- Michael Beschloss, our friend says twenty-five years, and so I'm a Beschlossian on this important question. And I-- I think that's about right. Forty years is biblical, and so, therefore, we should be for it. But-- but I think twenty-five at least worked for me. And I would say, if I may, President Bush died a year ago yesterday, and when you think about however imperfect a man he was in-- in-- in-- in life and politics, we're all-- we all have our problems, but he really embodied a kind of public service that seems incredibly remote now. It's almost as though we're talking about Agincourt when we think about a man who-- a Republican President who signed the America's Disabilities Act and managed the-- the fall of the Berlin Wall with such grace and restraint. And I think that when we think about that everything is cataclysmic and we're always at the edge of a cliff, twenty-five years ago we had a President that's almost unimaginable now until, as he would put it, we imagine it again. And so, you know, the first election we had in this country that was about the soul of America was eighteen hundred, when Thomas Jefferson ran saying we needed a revolution to get back to 1776. So if they were talking that way then, it's not surprising that we're talking this way now. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Jon Meacham, thank you so much. And thanks to all of you for being with us. We are going to ask Ruth to stick around for a few more minutes, and so you do that too. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We're back with Ruth Marcus to talk more about her book, \"Supreme Ambition: Brett Kavanaugh and the Conservative Takeover.\" RUTH MARCUS: Hi. JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back, Ruth. RUTH MARCUS: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: So some people may think of this as what they saw through their television screen which were faces in a room with a bunch of senators, but you-- you sketch a story of Titanic forces in America. Bring some of those forces into the story to remind people of really all that's going on in this drama. RUTH MARCUS: Sure. Well, as you say, this is not-- everybody was transfixed for a few weeks in the fall of 2018, but this is a story that stretches back decades, literally. This-- this is a thirty years war on behalf of Republicans and conservatives to finally cement a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. And that is the opportunity that they had with the resignation of Justice Anthony Kennedy and with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. And as the problems arose with the Kavanaugh nomination Republicans rallied around him, in part, because of some of the forces of partisanship that we've been talking about previously, but also because this was their moment to finally achieve this goal of thirty years, and Brett Kavanaugh was too big to fail. They were not going to allow him to do that. And so what I tell in the book, \"Supreme Ambition,\" is the story of how everyone from the White House counsel who refused to take a phone call from the President, who was trying desperately to reach him, Don McGahn was worried that the President was going to tell him to yank the Kavanaugh nomination. He didn't want to hear it from him. He didn't want to take a call from the most powerful man in the America. He told his deputy I don't talk to quitters. It's a story of how the FBI and senators, Republican and Democrat, refused to pursue leads that might have jeopardized the Kavanaugh nomination, and it's the story of what the implications are of this nomination for our country, because long after we're done with impeachment and long after the 2020 election, Donald Trump's legacy is going to be-- the judges that he put on the federal courts and on the Supreme Court and it is going to be the triumph of conservatives which explains why they have stuck with him for so long. JOHN DICKERSON: And that's a thirty to forty years, depending on the lifespan of the judges, thirty to four-- year impact on American life, not four or eight years of a presidency. RUTH MARCUS: No, it is a long time and Donald Trump has been going around and boasting about how he's-- his judges are younger than Obama judges, they're going to be around for a while. JOHN DICKERSON: Let's talk about Don McGahn, the White House counsel, really interesting. You just-- you just talked about an act of insubordination. There's been a lot of talk about when and when-- a staffer can and can't be insubordinate. He is perhaps-- and you tell me what you think-- the most powerful and beneficial advisor the President has. Wouldn't-- maybe have gotten elected without him. RUTH MARCUS: So a couple of things. Right here in this very building at the Jones Day law firm, Don McGahn helped to orchestrate the thing that probably, among everything else, helped Donald Trump get elected President, which was creating a list of Supreme Court nominees, not a-- not a surprise to have a shortlist, hugely Trumpian and never done before to have a list that was made public. Guess who was not on that list? Brett Kavanaugh. But-- JOHN DICKERSON: Made public during the campaign. RUTH MARCUS: Made public during the campaign and Brett Kavanaugh managed with the help of his friends, including Justice Kennedy to make his way on to that list, and with the help of Don McGahn, who was a fascinating figure, the most consequential White House counsel in history, both Donald Trump's greatest help in terms this lega-- helping to build the legacy, along with the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that will outlast this President and that he will be proudest of in the long run, but also in the Mueller investigation and we still see conversations about will-- whether we'll ever get his testimony on that, the President's greatest problem, because he testified and basically created the elements of the obstruction case against the President with Mueller. JOHN DICKERSON: Fifteen seconds, the reason the list was so important, is it showed conservatives that Donald Trump was-- RUTH MARCUS: A-- somebody who they could trust and to be taken seriously and that he would achieve what Republican Presidents before him had not managed to achieve and had squandered. JOHN DICKERSON: Mitch McConnell thinks that's why he's President. RUTH MARCUS: Indeed. JOHN DICKERSON: Ruth Marcus, thanks so much. It's a great book. \"Supreme Ambition\" is out Tuesday. It was published by Simon and Schuster, a division of the CBS Corporation. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. And thank you to the Jones Day law firm for the facilities here on Capitol Hill. Margaret will be back next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm John Dickerson.",

            "article_content": "Olive Garden is disputing rumors circulating on social media that it donated to President Trump's 2020 presidential campaign. After numerous people tweeted about it, the hashtag #BoycottOliveGarden began trending \u2014 and Olive Garden's official Twitter account stepped in to try to set the record straight. The popular chain, which is owned by Darden Restaurants, received a barrage of disappointed tweets after people started sharing a list of companies, including Olive Garden, that supposedly donated to the Trump campaign. \"I will never eat at Olive Garden again. By supporting Mr. Trump you are condoning racism, sexism and xenophobia,\" one person commented. \"blocking y'all. and never eating there. Y'all were the best Italian American place in Katy, Texas,\" another wrote. \"[Olive Garden] went out of business in my neighborhood. Probably because they were meddling in politics and not sticking to pasta,\" said another. Olive Garden's Twitter account responded to all of these comments \u2014 and many more \u2014 in a similar fashion: \"We don't know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates.\" While the restaurant tried to keep up with all of the comments, replying to countless angry customers, it is unclear if their response was enough to shut down the rumors. As of Monday, people were still using the \"Boycott Olive Garden\" hashtag, and some still seemed to believe Darden donated to Mr. Trump. Open Secrets, a nonprofit that keeps track of money donated to U.S. politicians, notes that Darden Restaurants as an organization never donated during the 2016 or 2018 election cycles. However, money could've been donated from PACs associated with the company, or individual employees, owners or their family members. During the 2018 election cycle, donations from those associated with Darden went to both Republicans and Democrats, Open Secrets reports. The top three donation recipients were GOPAC, a Republican group; Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida; and the Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association.\u00a0 During the 2016 election cycle, contributions from the company's associates were also diverse. The top donation recipient was the DNC Services Corp., a Democratic Party entity; followed by GOPAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee. People associated with Darden \u2014 but not the company itself \u2014 gave a total of $8,407 to Hillary Clinton and $886 to Donald Trump in 2016, as well as various amounts to dozens of other politicians from both sides of the aisle. It is unclear where the claims on Twitter originated. It appears many of the original tweets falsely claiming Olive Garden donated to Mr. Trump have been deleted.

            "article_content": "When the House voted Tuesday night to formally denounce President Trump's racist tweets, only four Republicans voted in favor of the resolution. All four come from states that Mr. Trump won in the 2016 election. Reps. Susan Brooks of Indiana, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Will Hurd of Texas and Fred Upton of Michigan joined every Democrat in the House in supporting the measure to condemn the president's tweets, which attacked four Democratic congresswomen of color. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, a conservative who left the Republican Party this month after saying that Mr. Trump had engaged in impeachable conduct, also voted in favor of the resolution. The resolution passed 240-187 after fierce debate on the House floor. It says that the president's \"racist comments\" have \"legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\" Mr. Trump had tweeted that the four congresswomen should \"go back\" to their countries, even though three were born in the U.S. and the fourth became a U.S. citizen as a teen. This is what the four Republicans said about their votes: The Indiana congresswoman, who is not running for reelection in 2020, was one of the few Republicans in Congress to speak out against Mr. Trump's remarks the day before the House vote. \"The lack of civility between the executive and legislative branches has reached an unacceptable low,\" she tweeted Tuesday night, calling the president's comments \"racially offensive.\" Yesterday, I issued a statement regarding the President\u2019s recent inappropriate remarks because I believe they do not reflect American values. I believe our diverse backgrounds as Americans make our country greater and stronger. These differences should be celebrated by all of us. The Pennsylvania congressman said that the \"'Hatfield versus McCoy' brand of politics\" has to end. \"The language and tone being used by so many in our country needs to change,\" he tweeted. \"Democrats and Republicans need to start treating each other respectfully and like human beings. We are all created in the image and likeness of God.\" The language and tone being used by so many in our country needs to change. The Hatfield versus McCoy brand of politics must end. Democrats and Republicans need to start treating each other respectfully and like human beings. We are all created in the image and likeness of God. The Texas congressman said there is \"no room in America for racism, sexism, antisemitism, xenophobia and hate.\" While saying he supported the measure, he also criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not moving as fast to bring a resolution condemning remarks from one of her fellow Democrats, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. \"Here's a novel concept: Maybe our elected officials should try to be role models to future generations. A first step: don't be anti-Semitic or racist. That way we spend less time rehashing lessons we learned in kindergarten and more time talking about threats facing our nation,\" Hurd tweeted. There is no room in America for racism, sexism, antisemitism, xenophobia and hate. I voted to condemn the President's tweets today but I hope that Speaker Pelosi also considers holding members of her own party accountable to the same degree to which she holds the President. The Michigan congressman said the resolution targeted words \"that frankly are not acceptable from a leader in any work place large or small.\" \"If we're going to bring civility back to the center of our politics, we must speak out against inflammatory rhetoric from anyone in any party anytime it happens,\" Upton wrote on Twitter. He also posted a quote from President Ronald Reagan about the importance of America embracing immigrants. Today\u2019s resolution was targeted at the specific words that frankly are not acceptable from a leader in any work place large or small. If we\u2019re going to bring civility back to the center of our politics, we must speak out against...",

Cory Booker, one of the two dozen Democrats competing for the party's presidential nomination, said President Trump is weaponizing racial animus to sow division in the country for his own political gain.\u00a0 \"He is somebody that is using race like a weapon to divide our country against itself,\" Booker said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"He's been using it since before he became president as a way to accelerate his gaining of political power.\" The New Jersey Democrat was referring to the president's recent attacks against four\u00a0progressive lawmakers of color. Last week, Mr. Trump posted a series of racist tweets suggesting that Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan should \"go back\" to the \"totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" Only Omar was born outside the U.S. Pressley, who is African American, was born in Ohio. Ocasio-Cortez, of Puerto Rican heritage, was born in New York. Tlaib, the daughter of Palestinian immigrants, was born in Detroit. Omar, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in Somalia, a country she and her family fled from because of a civil war.\u00a0 Booker said the president's controversial remarks \u2014 which were formally condemned by a resolution passed by the Democratic-led House \u2014 are reminiscent of tactics used by politicians throughout American history to stir up xenophobia and racism for political gain. He compared them to anti-Irish tropes in the 19th century and the rhetoric of segregationists during the Civil Rights era. \u00a0 \"The language he uses is actually language, tired old tropes, that have been used by demagogues all throughout our country's history,\" Booker said, adding later. \"This president is yet another sad chapter.\" Citing the work across the aisle Democrats and Republicans achieved last century to pass civil rights legislation \u2014 and how he believes those laws allowed him to become a U.S. senator \u2014 Booker said denouncing Mr. Trump's comments should be a bipartisan undertaking. Anything else, he added, is a dereliction of duty.\u00a0 \"I don't give a damn about the politics of it. Racism is racism,\" he said. \"And to say nothing in the face of it is to be complicit in that kind of language.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0on Saturday returned to Brooklyn, his birthplace, for the first rally of his second presidential campaign and sought to tie his working-class background to his populist views that are helping reshape the Democratic Party.  He predicted he would win the nomination in a field of now-double digit rivals and then defeat President Donald Trump, \"the most dangerous president in modern American history.\" After falling short in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, the Vermont independent told supporters at a rally at Brooklyn College, which he once attended, that his campaign is saying \"loudly and clearly that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed, hatred and lies. It will not be racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia and religious bigotry. That is going to end.\" Sanders pledged to fight for \"economic justice, social justice, racial justice and environmental justice.\" He had begun his 2016 campaign in Vermont, which he has represented in the Senate for nearly two decades. But this time, as he tries to showcase more of his personal story, Sanders kicked off his 2020 bid in the New York City borough where he grew up as the son of a Jewish immigrant and lived in a rent-controlled apartment. Campaign priorities include \"Medicare for all,\" a $15-an-hour minimum wage and addressing climate change. And Sanders is focusing on his working-class roots and how his family's financial struggles have shaped his views. In those reflections is an implicit contrast to another New Yorker, Trump, a billionaire who hails from Queens.\u00a0 After Brooklyn, Sanders planned to travel to Selma, Alabama, where he will be among the politicians commemorating the anniversary of the 1965 clash known as \"Bloody Sunday,\" when peaceful demonstrators were beaten back by Alabama state troopers as they attempted to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge. A second campaign rally this weekend was set for Chicago, where he attended the University of Chicago and was involved in civil rights protests. Sanders had previously frustrated some aides and supporters with his reticence to share more of his personal story. Sanders joins the 2020 race not as an outlier but as one of the best-known candidates in an large and expanding field. He also has a strong base of small-dollar donors: In the first week of his campaign, Sanders raised $10 million, far outpacing his rivals. The political moment that he faces in his second bid, however, is far different than when he ran four years ago. A number of the liberal positions that Sanders has championed, in some cases for years, have been backed by other Democrats in the field, notably Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is campaigning with similar populist notes. ",
