            "article_content": "In his first TV interview since President Trump announced his nomination to lead the U.S. intelligence community, Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe pushed back against charges he's not qualified, given the complex nature of threats facing the nation and the emergence of the coronavirus. \"I have been handling national security issues as far back as 2005,\" Ratcliffe told CBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge in an exclusive interview. \"I have spent four years at the Justice Department in charge of sensitive matters of national security, anti-terrorism investigations. For the last five years I have been legislating almost exclusively on national security issues.\" On the coronavirus, Ratcliffe said China and North Korea can't be trusted to provide accurate data, adding he is confident the U.S. intelligence community has the tools to provide the most complete picture. \"We can't really count on countries like China and North Korea giving us accurate information with respect to the, for instance number of cases and the lethality of those cases. So this is where intelligence community and our intelligence collection discipline \u2014 things like human intelligence and signals intelligence and other collection disciplines \u2014 are important to get the actual numbers, the actual data that we can get to our infectious disease experts for predictive analysis,\" Ratcliffe said. Before he entered Congress in 2015, where he sits on the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, Ratcliffe was a U.S. attorney, and the mayor of Heath, Texas, a town of about 7,000. Ratcliffe addressed concerns that he has never served in an intelligence agency, arguing that having that experience shouldn't be a prerequisite for the position overseeing the nation's 17 intelligence organizations. \"I have not served in an intelligence agency. I think that bringing a different experience today is really going to be vitally important \u2014 all of the experience in the world isn't helpful without judgment, and I think what we have seen is that some of our most experienced intelligence officials have gotten it wrong, like regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,\" Ratcliffe said. \"I hope to bring incredible experience regarding national security and intelligence from all of the different vantage points that I have had into a modern day intelligence community to address all of these threats.\" He also rejected suggestions that Mr. Trump values loyalty over experience. \"In my case he is certainly putting experience out front \u2014 as I have talked about my experience as a U.S. attorney on national security issues as a legislature almost exclusively in these areas \u2014 that was important to him,\" Ratcliffe said. \"What we talked about is my loyalty to the constitution, to the rule of law, and standing up for people being treated fairly under that respect. My selection and nomination has to do with loyalty to the rule of law.\" Ratcliffe was originally tapped to be director of national intelligence last summer, but withdrew after allegations he had padded his resume about terrorism prosecutions and a major immigration raid. Asked if he had embellished his role in an immigration sweep a decade ago, Ratcliffe's reply was \"no,\" and pointed to a Justice Department release about the arrests that quoted him. The\u00a0release\u00a0said \"more than 280 foreign nationals were arrested.\" \u00a0According to the\u00a0Washington Post, his congressional website had said, \"As a U.S. Attorney, I arrested over 300 illegal immigrants on a single day,\" but only a fraction had been charged by Ratcliffe's office.\u00a0 On the allegation that he had played up his record as a U.S. attorney, the Texas congressman said: \"The allegation was that I never served as U.S. attorney. I was appointed to serve not once but twice.\" Asked if errors were made, Ratcliffe said, \"Where there have been statements or any inaccurate information on campaign literature or press releases that have gone out of my the office. I've tried to clarify that. And, and move on past that. But again, my experience my background my qualifications my judgment, If people really look closely at it they'll see that I'm more than qualified. \" A passionate defender of the president, Ratcliffe said his very public role during special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and more recently during Mr. Trump's impeachment will allow people to judge his abilities. Ratcliffe was among the first to flag irregularities in the surveillance of a Trump campaign aide. An independent Justice Department watchdog, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, confirmed major errors last December. \"I've had a very public role. People have been able to observe again my temperament, my judgment, my abilities, my talents,\" Ratcliffe explained. \"I've demonstrated that I've been right on some of these most important issues.\" Congressional Democrats have labeled Ratcliffe partisan and a conspiracy theorist. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, called him\u00a0\"an unqualified nominee\u00a0who should not be confirmed.\" \"Adam Schiff has a lot invested in a narrative that has proven not to be true. There was no Russian conspiracy,\" Ratcliffe said. He also predicted the confirmation process would be swift, saying, \"I think that I'll have the support of all Republicans at the end of the day.\" Congressional sources from both sides of the aisle have predicted his confirmation process will be challenging because of the concerns about his lack of intelligence experience and perceived lack of independence from the president. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is the committee that will vet Ratcliffe, has eight Republicans and seven Democrats. Aides on both sides say that it's entirely possible that all the Democrats will vote against his confirmation, putting GOP Senator Susan Collins under pressure. She is up for reelection this year.\u00a0 On election interference, Ratcliffe said that the threat is very real, and that the Russians' success was \"far beyond what any of us would have ever hoped and probably far beyond the expectations that Vladimir Putin ever had.\"\u00a0 \"It's important that our intelligence community, be able to give the president the information that he needs to confront Russia or any other country that will interfere with our elections going forward, and understand that there are consequences for doing that,\" Ratcliffe said. \"It's just a matter of making sure that you coordinate that leadership and give that unvarnished information to the president in a way that compels him to take the action to discourage our adversaries, or allies, from interfering in our elections.\" While he is a controversial and polarizing choice, if confirmed Ratcliffe said he wants to strip the politics out of intelligence. \"I think one of the overriding priorities for me is to ensure that our intelligence community becomes entirely apolitical and get past the finger-pointing on both sides of who's to blame with respect to that, and I'm looking forward to being the DNI where people can say 'You know what, he took politics out of it completely, he respected the good work of the warriors and the intelligence community and deliver the unvarnished truth,'\" Ratcliffe said. Asked if he has been given a mandate, Ratcliffe said his priority is to improve \"efficiency and its effectiveness\" and \"to innovate to the current national security threats facing us.\" Catherine Herridge is a senior investigative correspondent for CBS News covering national security and intelligence based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014\u00a0In 2016, the Supreme Court vacancy opened by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia spurred conservatives to vote for Donald Trump, a celebrity businessman who made the judicial appointment central to his campaign. \u00a0 Most Americans \u2014 70%, according to\u00a0CBS News exit polling\u00a0\u2014 considered Supreme Court appointments an important or the most important factor in deciding their vote for president in that election. Crucial to Mr. Trump's victory was his promise to appoint justices in the mold of Scalia, which he reinforced by releasing a list of Supreme Court contenders in the run-up to the election.\u00a0 Now, with two Supreme Court appointments in his first term, the president is again\u00a0pledging to give voters a slate\u00a0of candidates next month, and he plans to highlight recent rulings in which Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's four-member liberal bloc as a springboard. With the election less than 100 days away, Mr. Trump and conservatives won't be alone in staking the future of the high court on November 3, since progressive groups are also making it a mobilizing issue, albeit for Democratic voters. \"There's an understanding this year like I haven't seen in the past that the Supreme Court is on the ballot,\" Jen Psaki, former White House communications director under President Obama, told CBS News. \"Republicans have always known that, but we've seen in polls that Democrats and progressives are really starting to understand that and be motivated.\" A Morning Consult/Politico poll released Wednesday found that 57% of Democratic voters said the Supreme Court was \"very important\" in deciding which candidate to vote for in the presidential election, an increase from 48% in early May. Among Republican voters, 53% said the high court was \"very important\" in choosing who to support in November, which is unchanged from May. The poll was conducted after the high court closed out its blockbuster term with rulings on abortion restrictions, workplace protections for LGBTQ workers, immigration and efforts to secure Mr. Trump's tax returns and business records. And the court has still been active this summer. The justices have responded to several emergency requests, many of which involve voting rights and restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic. This month, the high court left in place a temporary block on a lower court order that paved the way for felons in Florida to register to vote. A divided 5-4 court also blocked a lower court ruling that eased voting restrictions in Alabama during the pandemic, and curtailed extended absentee voting in Wisconsin. Chris Kang, chief counsel for Demand Justice, a progressive judicial advocacy group that is leading the effort to make the court a key factor for Democratic voters, said voting rights disputes could help motivate liberal voters to turn out. \"What has been the dominant theme of the Roberts Court has been a hostility to voting rights, especially when it comes to people of color,\" Kang told CBS News. \"This isn't something the Supreme Court is going to avoid.\" It's also not lost on Democrats that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is the anchor of the bench's liberal wing, has been plagued by health issues. Ginsburg has had four bouts with cancer and been in and out of the hospital for various ailments this year. The justice disclosed last month that she has been undergoing treatment for a recurrence of cancer after a scan in February revealed lesions on her liver, and the Supreme Court said late last month the 87-year-old underwent a non-surgical procedure on a bile duct stent she received last year. In a statement revealing her chemotherapy, Ginsburg closed with her oft-repeated promise to remain on the Supreme Court as long as she can do the job full steam, and said \"I remain fully able to do that.\" Still, her health woes have underscored what seems like a strong possibility that the next president will fill another vacancy. \"If you're looking at a situation where Donald Trump could nominate another Brett Kavanaugh or two Brett Kavanaughs, who are young and party loyalists, I think the connection has been drawn in a more clear way than it has been in the past,\" Psaki said. \"Democrats need to continue to connect the future of the Supreme Court, the impact of an expanding conservative bloc of the Supreme Court, to the issues that are impacting people in their everyday lives.\" Mr. Trump's appointment of Kavanaugh, who replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy on the court, solidified the Supreme Court's 5-4 conservative majority. The rightward shift spurred by his confirmation left Roberts as the middle of the court, and in several instance the chief justice has filled the role as the swing vote, helping to deliver victories for progressives in striking down a Louisiana abortion restriction and blocking the Trump administration's unwinding of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. But if\u00a0 Mr. Trump is reelected and given the opportunity to name a third or even a fourth justice \u2014 Justice Stephen Breyer is 81 \u2014 it would cement the high court's conservative majority and dilute Roberts' impact. \"You have one more Brett Kavanaugh and it doesn't matter where John Roberts is on healthcare,\" Psaki said.\u00a0 Roberts joined the four liberal justices in 2012 to uphold Obamacare's individual mandate, and the healthcare law will be before the Supreme Court again in its next term, which begins in October. \"Every president since Ronald Reagan has appointed two Supreme Court justices, and so I think that the long-term future of the Supreme Court, the balance of the court is on the line,\" Kang said. Progressive groups have also succeeded in convincing establishment Democrats that the Supreme Court could be critical in motivating voters, made evident by its inclusion in the party's platform this year. At the Democratic National Convention in 2016, Judge Merrick Garland, who had been nominated by President Obama to fill Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court, was hardly mentioned. But language adopted by the Democratic Convention Platform Committee and circulated by Demand Justice, which pushed for inclusion of the reforms, states that the party \"recognizes the need for structural court reforms to increase transparency and accountability.\" \"The Republican Party has packed our federal courts with unqualified, partisan judges who consistently rule for corporations, the wealthy and Republican interests,\" the platform will say, according to Demand Justice. \"They have undermined the legitimacy of our courts through an anti-democratic, win-at-all costs campaign that includes blocking a Democratic president from appointing a justice to the Supreme Court and obstructing dozens of diverse lower-court nominees.\" Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has also made his own promise when it comes to the Supreme Court: to nominate the first Black woman justice. Progressives are urging Biden to release his own Supreme Court list to galvanize voters, as was the case with conservatives and evangelicals reluctant to back Mr. Trump in 2016.\u00a0 \"People understand now in order to take meaningful steps for climate change, we're going to need a Supreme Court that's going to uphold those changes. The same with preventing gun violence and reestablishing voting rights,\" Kang said. \"All these issues driving you to the polls are going to be dependent on the Supreme Court.\"",

            "article_content": "Brad Parscale, Donald Trump's campaign manager, did not vote for President Trump in 2016. In fact, he didn't vote in the general election at all,\u00a0according to election records obtained by CBS News. Bexar County, Texas Election Department documents show Parscale, then a San Antonio resident, voted in the 2016 primary but not in the general election. He did cast a ballot in the 2012 and 2018 federal elections. And his 2018 vote was submitted by mail. \"In 2016, I was in New York working to elect Donald Trump and encountered a series of problems receiving my absentee ballot from Texas and missed the deadline,\" Parscale said in a statement to CBS News. \"Just further proof that vote-by-mail is not the flawless solution Democrats and the media pretend it is.\" President Trump, who voted by mail in the 2020 Florida primary, has complained the expansion of vote-by-mail is a gateway to fraud as states grapple with holding elections this fall amid the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 \"There's a vast difference between voting absentee by mail when you can't get to the polls on Election Day versus mailing every registered voter a ballot, even those who didn't request one. The media thinks they're playing 'gotcha' by purposefully ignoring that difference,\" Parscale said, adding that voter rolls often contain errors. Parscale submitted his 2018 midterm ballot by mail. Election records show he applied to vote absentee about two weeks before Election Day.\u00a0 He was hired by Mr. Trump before he announced his candidacy in 2015. He was brought on to build the campaign's website and eventually ascended into candidate Trump's inner circle, working closely with Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner on digital outreach. He was named campaign manager in early 2018.

In an interview with\u00a0CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett\u00a0for this week's episode of\u00a0\"The Takeout\" podcast, Sanders said it was a \"testament\" to Biden that he had broadened his circle of advisers. \"We have a good mix going on,\" Sanders said about the makeup of Biden's campaign. \"And I do believe that's how we were able to, frankly, capture the nomination and that's how we'll defeat Donald Trump.\" Sanders also disputed that there was any sort of \"palace intrigue\" in the campaign, with different advisers jockeying for favor. \"There is this notion that he may not be listening to some people, that there are some people that do not have his ear, and I would just like to dispel that myth. The strength of Joe Biden is the fact that he is a listener, he has empathy, he is always constantly critically thinking about things and how he can retool them and make them better,\" Sanders said. You can find the full episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast\u00a0here. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign has begun building out its operation in Arizona, naming a new state director (Jessica Mej\u00eda) and senior adviser (Andrew Piatt), reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Mej\u00eda, formerly a regional director for EMILY's List and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, was\u00a0first tapped in October to serve as the campaign's California state director. Piatt, who managed Kyrsten Sinema's successful Senate campaign in 2018, was last a campaign director\u00a0at The Hub Project, a dark money group that\u00a0has dumped millions into funding left-leaning causes and attacking Republican candidates, including\u00a0against Sinema's opponent Martha McSally. The Biden campaign had\u00a0initially announced plans\u00a0to debut more than 600 field and outreach staff by June but has yet to name even top staffers for many of the other states highlighted in their \"Path to 270.\" However, while the Trump campaign has\u00a0spent years building out its operation\u00a0in Arizona and has far outspent the Biden campaign\u00a0on the airwaves, Mr. Trump has continued to poll behind Biden in the state. \"Jessica Mejia and Andrew Piatt have the experience, skill, and talent to help drive Joe Biden to victory in Arizona. This is just the beginning, we're excited to continue to expand our footprint in the state, bring on talented individuals to fill out our senior leadership team, and make Donald Trump a one-term President,\" Jenn Ridder, the campaign's director of states, said in a statement. PRESIDENT TRUMP Mr. Trump will host one of his signature rallies, directly addressing supporters for the first time in over 100 days, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at 7 p.m. CT Saturday. The details, which evolved amid mounting health and security concerns pinned to the pandemic and Juneteenth holiday, appear as misty as Oklahoma's 75% humidity, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. Attendees originally expected to file into the 19,990 seat BOK Center arena at 10 a.m. local time, will now be forced to wait five more hours. Devoted Trump supporters, mounting tents and lawn chairs in a single-file line for the entire week leading up to the rally, have been pushed back beyond a widening security perimeter into part of a residential block. The city of Tulsa laid plans to enforce a curfew Friday and Saturday nights, but the president tweeted Friday afternoon that he spoke to Tulsa Mayor G. T. Bynum and there would be no curfew. \"There will be no curfew tonight or tomorrow for our many supporters attending the #MAGA Rally. Enjoy yourselves - thank you to Mayor Bynum!\" the president tweeted. The\"Tulsa World\" story on Friday read \"Like an approaching cyclone, the bits and pieces of what is likely to be a memorable and perhaps momentous weekend swirled about Tulsa.\" But beyond the analogy, literal thunderstorms are forecasted to strike during the president's remarks, throwing a wrench into campaign plans to host a day-long outside festival in the run up to Mr. Trump's arrival. At least three counter-protests \u2014 including one by Black Lives Matter Tulsa \u2014 will lead marches against hate and systemic racism on Saturday as 52 Trump surrogates and musical entertainment file into a packed arena. \"Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis,\" Mr. Trump threatened in a tweet on Friday. \"It will be a much different scene!\" Local health officials, Trump campaign surrogates and U.S. Senator from Oklahoma, James Lankford, have all urged seniors and people in high-risk health groups to stay home. \"We're going to provide hand sanitizer,\" Marc Lotter, the Trump campaign's director of strategic communications, told CBS News. \"We're going to provide temperature checks. But we would we would encourage that if you're worried about being in a high-risk group or someone in your household is of a high-risk factor, then maybe pass on this rally and come to another one later down the road.\" Mr. Trump praised Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt in a visit to the White House on Thursday. \"One of the reasons we chose your state, Kevin, is you have done so well with the COVID,\" Mr. Trump told him. \"You have handled it incredibly well.\" New cases of COVID-19 have skyrocketed in the state of Oklahoma this week. A total of 450 new infections were found statewide Thursday, exceeding the state's previous record of 259 that was reported Wednesday. Tulsa reported 82 new cases on Thursday and the state's total rose to 9,354. The president and Governor made no public mention of Oklahoma's COVID-19 surge , Thursday. HONORING JUNETEENTH On the heels of weeks-long protests across the world calling for an end to systemic inequities and justice in policing,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0notes that\u00a0Juneteenth\u00a0\u2014 the celebration commemorating the emancipation of enslaved black people in America\u2014has received heightened national attention, 155 years later. On June 19, 1865, some of the last enslaved black Americans in Galveston, Texas, learned they were free, two years after the\u00a0Emancipation Proclamation had been issued, declaring freedom for \"all persons held as slaves\" within rebellious states that had seceded from the United States during the Civil War. In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with\u00a0CBS This Morning, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas said that making Juneteenth a national holiday \"opens a whole world of discussion for America, a whole reckoning with racism, and the systemic racism that permeates the nation.\" Jackson Lee also added that she's pleased that there are more than 200 co-sponsors for a resolution to make Juneteenth a national holiday. Mitchell\u00a0adds political and community leaders across the country have weighed in on the national discussion and \"reckoning with racism\" that Jackson Lee described. In an\u00a0op-ed published by Essence on Friday, Biden said that Juneteenth is a reminder of the nation's vulnerability to be \"poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity\" but also, \"reminds us, too, of our incredible capacity to heal, to hope, and to emerge from our darkest moments of cruelty into a better version of ourselves.\"\u00a0 In a statement issued by the White House, Mr. Trump said, \"Juneteenth reminds us of both the unimaginable injustice of slavery and the incomparable joy that must have attended emancipation. It is both a remembrance of a blight on our history and a celebration of our Nation's unsurpassed ability to triumph over darkness.\"\u00a0 Meanwhile, nearly 4,000 people logged on for the first-ever virtual social justice conference, JusticeCon: A Path Towards Freedom, reports\u00a0CBS News Correspondent Nikole Killion.\u00a0The all-day event, held on Juneteenth, highlighted what organizers call the \"double pandemic\" of COVID-19 and systemic racism. It was aimed at empowering leaders for social change through the \"power of community, conversation and action.\" Headliners included Biden, Senators Chuck Schumer, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Elizabeth Warren, and Representative Val Demings. Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, National Action Network president, kicked off the conference that featured African American faith leaders, activists and grassroots organizations. Breakout sessions focused on the policing system, the future of the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as strategies for building political power and developing a policy agenda for black America.\u00a0 The event was convened by Faith for Black Lives, in partnership with The Greater Allen AME Cathedral of New York. \"This moment requires a commitment to lift our collective voices to build a comprehensive strategy to redeem the soul of humanity to eradicate poverty, militarism, and racism,\" said Faith for Black Lives Chair and JusticeCon organizer Reverend Stephen A. Green. During Demings' remarks, she spoke briefly about the power of unity and the hope of better days to come.\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reports that using excerpts from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Demings asserted that as the country remembers Juneteenth, she believes the country will also continue to work together to form a more perfect union. IMMIGRATION One day after the United States Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration from ending the DACA program, Mr. Trump said his administration will resubmit paperwork to end the Obama-era program, reports\u00a0CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. On Thursday, the Supreme Court released its 5-4 decision with the majority opinion calling the effort to unwind DACA \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the Administrative Procedure Act. On Friday, the president tweeted that the highest court had \"asked us to resubmit on DACA, nothing was lost or won.\" He described the decision as \"punted\" and said the administration would be submitting \"enhanced papers shortly.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump has been trying to dismantle the protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought into the United States as children since September 2017. He claims Democrats have abandoned DACA, but Democrats push back accusing him of trying to use Dreamers as a bargaining chip. Efforts to pass immigration reform legislation that addresses both Dreamers and border security failed in 2018 despite Republicans having control of both chambers of Congress. The latest CBS News polling found 85% support allowing immigrants brought into the country as children to stay. AD WARS Ahead of President Trump's rally Saturday in Tulsa, the Democratic National Committee took out a full page newspaper ad in a historic black paper in Tulsa, the Oklahoma Eagle. The move coincides with Juneteenth. The ad references remarks from Mr. Trump in 2016 when he asked \"what do you have lose?\" while addressing African-American voters on the campaign trail. The ad reads, \"What do we have to lose? A lot. We've lost jobs. We've lost lives.\" It goes on to claim \"this administration failed us\" and reminds viewers to check their voter registration status. Meanwhile, several anti-Trump television ads are also airing in Tulsa ahead of the rally. Republicans for the Rule of Law placed an ad with Republicans stating why they are not voting again for Trump in 2020. The Lincoln Project also had two ads in Tulsa including one focused on the appearance of the confederate flag at Trump rallies, while the other juxtaposes the words of Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy with those of George Wallace and President Trump. At the same time, the pro-Trump PAC America First Action launched a new round of ads in the battleground states, notes\u00a0CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. The investment includes $3.5 million in Pennsylvania, $2.25 million in Wisconsin and $1.75 million in Michigan, with spots taking aim at Joe Biden's economic and trade policies. In the Michigan ad titled \"Warned\"\u00a0 and the Wisconsin spot titled \"Wrong,\" the narrator slams Biden for his support of NAFTA while claiming Biden can't be trusted to protect jobs in those states. In the Pennsylvania spot titled \"Warned,\" the PAC claims Biden wants to eliminate fracking (something his campaign refutes), meaning an end to jobs in the keystone state. The digital, cable, broadcast and mail investment run until the July 4th weekend. The Trump campaign unveiled two new television ads on Friday ahead of his first rally back on the campaign trail since the coronavirus outbreak. One of the ads is titled \"Just Getting Started.\" In it, the narrator attacks Biden for \"failed, old, liberal ideas,\" before claiming Mr. Trump led the U.S. to the strongest recovery in history. It goes on to say he's \"doing it again.\" The other ad titled \"Fortitude\" is a 30-second spot raising questions about Biden's age. \"Joe Biden is slipping,\" the narrator begins before a few clips of Biden play mixed with the narrator calling him \"clearly diminished\" and questioning his strength and stamina. According to Kantar/CMAG, the ad first aired Friday morning in Florida. Despite the ad going after Biden's age, several recent polls show the 77-year-old former vice president leading Mr. Trump among voters over 65. ARIZONA As the president heads to Oklahoma, Democrats in the state next up for a visit from Mr. Trump are up in arms over the stop, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"We're a growing hot spot. And I think it's very dangerous for him to be here,\" Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego, a Democrat who represents the district neighboring the president's visit,\u00a0said Wednesday on a press call for the Biden campaign. Attendees to the president's remarks next week will likely be required to wear a mask: Citing climbing COVID-19 cases, Phoenix mandated face masks citywide on Friday with\u00a0only a handful of exceptions. In addition to the president's\u00a0previously announced\u00a0event with Students for Trump in Phoenix, a White House official\u00a0said Friday that Mr. Trump is also headed to the Arizona town of Yuma for a \"roundtable\" on border security. The area hosts much of the Trump administration's recently constructed \"new border wall system.\"\u00a0 \"From his failure to respond to the COVID-19 crisis to his disastrous border policies, President Trump has nothing to celebrate in Arizona,\" said Democratic Congressman Ra\u00fal Grijalva, who does not plan to participate in the president's visit to his district along the U.S.-Mexico border. \"The only thing Trump has accomplished over the past few years is sowing division, demonizing those who are different, and leaving this country worse off in the long run.\"",

            "article_content": "The Department of Homeland Security has concluded its first-ever \"Homeland Threat Assessment,\" a comprehensive report designed to educate the public on the largest threats facing the country. The report, first obtained by CBS News, highlights major threats posed by China and Russia and identifies white supremacists as posing the \"most persistent and lethal threat\" of all domestic violent extremist groups.\u00a0 In an exclusive interview, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said the report \"touches on all the major threat streams that I look at on a daily basis.\"\u00a0 In September, a senior DHS official alleged in a whistleblower complaint that Wolf told him to withhold an intelligence notification on Russian activities because it \"made the president look bad,\" and claimed senior Trump administration officials urged analysts to downplay the threat of violent white supremacy. But Wolf told CBS News on Monday that the Homeland Threat Assessment was free from political influence.\u00a0 \"I am obviously aware of those complaints,\" he said. \"I think if you look at the document, Russia is mentioned somewhere in the document between 30 and 40 different times, so if we were trying to downplay Russia, we didn't do a very good job, I would say.\u00a0 The threat is specifically called out there when we talk about election, potential election interference, or disinformation\u2026 We are very upfront.\" These are the major takeaways from the report. \u00a0 The report cited multiple potential threats from China, warning the country \"already poses a high cyber espionage threat to the Homeland and Beijing's cyber-attack capabilities will grow.\"\u00a0 It also said China has been a \"particularly persistent\" source of counterfeit medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that more than 1 million FDA-prohibited COVID-19 test kits and 75,000 counterfeit masks have been seized from illicit Chinese manufacturers. The report warned that Beijing has been monitoring shortages in U.S. medical supply chains, and said China could exploit those shortages to force the government to adopt more pro-China policies.\u00a0 Wolf told CBS News that he believes \"the most long term strategic threat to Americans to the Homeland and really to our way of life would be the threat from China.\"\u00a0 \"It cuts across a variety of different threats, from the cyber threats we see, from foreign influence, to supply chain security, to exploiting our academic and visa systems, foreign investment here in the U.S., trade policy violations and the like. It goes on and on and on\u2026\" he said. \"Just across the board, threat after threat stream, we see China playing a very significant and enhanced role trying to really do the U.S. some long-term harm.\" The report also highlighted Russia's efforts to influence the 2020 U.S. Presidential election by exacerbating existing social and political tensions in an effort to \"sway U.S. voter perceptions.\"\u00a0 The report did not indicate a preference by Russia for a specific candidate, but did note an effort to undermine the campaign of Joe Biden: \"Russia uses divisive measures to disrupt the electoral process \u2014 including denigrating former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment' \u2014 as part of a broader effort to divide and destabilize America,\" the report says. Wolf told CBS News that despite foreign attempts to influence the election, he does not believe that any election infrastructure has been compromised.\u00a0 \"What we know right now is that none of those nation states are targeting election infrastructure, at least haven't done so successfully,\" he said. \"That is different than what we saw in 2016 at this time, leading up to the election.\" The report also highlighted Russia's skill in cyber espionage and cyber attacks, warning that the nation likely has the ability to conduct attacks that would last hours to days, and is developing the capability to conduct \"more debilitating\" attacks. \u00a0 The report found that the most likely terrorist threat to the United States comes from \"ideologically motivated lone offenders and small groups,\" with domestic violent extremists posing the \"primary terrorist threat\" inside the U.S. Of the domestic violent extremists, the report said, \"racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists\u2014specifically white supremacist extremists (WSEs)\u2014will remain the most persistent and lethal threat.\"\u00a0 White supremacist groups have killed more people than any other domestic violent extremist group, according to the report. But Wolf told CBS News that the report is \"also very clear to call out anarchist threats.\" \u00a0 \"..if you are only looking at deaths, and you are not looking at property damage, insurance claims and all the other societal factors, and only looking at deaths, then yes, white supremacist extremists sort of lead that category,\" Wolf said. \"But as we have witnessed over the last several months, the movements and the civil unrest we have seen here inside the U.S., while maybe not lethal, certainly have lasting implications to the homeland and do serve as a threat to the homeland.\"\u00a0\u00a0The report said that \"DHS law enforcement officers suffered over 300 separate injuries and\u00a0 were assaulted with sledgehammers,\u00a0 commercial grade fireworks, rocks, metal pipes, improvised explosive devices, and more\" as part of violence perpetrated by \"anarchist extremists.\" The report touched on a number of other threats, including Iran and North Korea. While the report stressed that the cyber capabilities of both nations were weaker than those of China and Russia, it nevertheless warned that the nations could develop the ability to conduct disruptive attacks.\u00a0 While the report said that U.S. counterterrorism efforts have reduced the likelihood of a foreign terrorist attack on U.S. soil, it warned that terrorist groups \"can adapt quickly and resurge,\" and said Iran \"will continue to develop and maintain terrorist capabilities\" to deter the U.S. from \"regime-threatening actions\" or to retaliate for such activity.\u00a0 The report made clear that the founding principal of combatting terrorism \"will always be a priority to the Department of Homeland Security.\" The report also cited illegal immigration, noting that while the vast majority of migrants do not pose a security risk, \"pathways used by migrants to travel to the United States have been exploited by threat actors.\"\u00a0 The report concluded by noting the record-breaking hurricane and wildfire seasons that have caused billions of dollars in damage this year. While the report cited active land management as a potential solution for the wildfires, it did not mention climate change in either section\u00a0 \u2014 despite the fact that experts have linked the intensity of the hurricane and wildfire seasons to global warming.\u00a0 DHS Homeland Threat Assessment by News Team Catherine Herridge is a senior investigative correspondent for CBS News covering national security and intelligence based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "In 2016, a total of 206 counties across the country that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 swung away to support Republican nominee Donald Trump in 2016. Wisconsin has 23 of these counties.\u00a0 More than a dozen of these counties are in western Wisconsin. Communities lining the banks of the Mississippi River helped turn Wisconsin Republican in the first presidential election since 1984.\u00a0 These rural, overwhelmingly White and sparsely populated counties in the state's western edge are highly\u00a0 sought, in large part, for their lack of partisan loyalty at a time when Americans sit increasingly entrenched in Democratic and Republican camps.\u00a0 John Valentine, a 55-year-old from Viola, Wisconsin who works in maintenance, supported Mr. Obama in 2008, but regretted his decision because his health insurance costs then went up. He sat out 2012, but voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and is voting for him again this year. \"He's a leader \u2014 he's not afraid to tell people what needs to be said,\" Valentine said while packing up his car outside of a Walmart in Richland County. Mr. Obama won the county by 16.1 points in 2012, and Mr. Trump won it by 5.5 points in 2016.\u00a0 And while many of Wisconsin's small towns and cities in its southwestern corner drove up Mr. Trump's margins, most had not voted for Republicans in decades, says Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\u00a0 \"That was part of Trump's victory in the state, for sure \u2014 to cobble together a lot of those small communities to overcome losses in other parts of the state,\" said Burden. The communities also tend to skew older and with working-class roots, a critical base of support for Mr. Trump's 2016 victory offsetting smaller margins in the traditionally Republican suburbs.\u00a0 \"Compared to prior Republicans, both statewide candidates and presidential candidates, Trump is not faring as well in the suburbs as they had, particularly the suburbs around Milwaukee,\" said Burden. \"He needs to compensate by winning some Republican votes elsewhere, and four years ago, that was done by winning a lot of rural communities.\" But Democrats reclaimed some of the territory in western Wisconsin in 2018. Governor Tony Evers carried five of the counties that Mr. Trump flipped, and Senator Tammy Baldwin won nine.\u00a0 Burden said that the president's message on trade, health care and illegal immigration resonated with voters four years ago, but some are \"unsatisfied\" with Mr. Trump's record.\u00a0 Many communities in the region have deep ties to farming, especially in southwestern Wisconsin and have endured big losses in recent years. In 2019, Wisconsin led the country in farm bankruptcies, according to the American Farm Bureau, and the state lost 10% of its dairy herds due to low milk prices.\u00a0 Representative Ron Kind, a moderate Democrat whose district encompasses many of the areas that pivoted to Mr. Trump in 2016, thinks both parties \"have been derelict in addressing income inequality, and opportunities for all workers.\"\u00a0 The 12-term incumbent now faces a serious challenge to keep his seat. President Trump won Kind's district by 4 points in 2016, when he was unopposed.. This year, Kind is depending on\u00a0 Democrats' \"PTSD from 2016,\" combined with greater enthusiasm for Joe Biden, to drive turnout.\u00a0 \"Obviously, four years ago, you had a known entity of 30 years. People had pretty much made their mind up, and decided to take a flyer on the outside change agent, Donald Trump,\" Kind told CBS News. \"Fast-forward four years, and I don't think there's a lot of embrace of what they've seen and what he has done, especially at the height of this pandemic.\" As coronavirus' third resurgence ravages the Midwest, nearly every county in western and southwest Wisconsin is seeing\u00a0 \"very high\" case activity levels according to state data, with hospitalizations on the rise in some counties.\u00a0 Bob Nugent, a 76-year-old retired school administrator from Ithaca, Wisconsin, recently recovered from COVID-19. The Biden supporter experienced a bad cough and felt constantly fatigued.\u00a0 \"It's unimaginable that a country of our wealth and...how medically astute we are that we're in this position,\" Nugent said \"And it's just because Donald Trump screwed up.\" On Tuesday, just before President Trump arrived to campaign in West Salem, health officials in the state announced Wisconsin's highest number of daily coronavirus cases and deaths since the pandemic began. That same day, the U.S. added more than 74,000 cases. The president repeatedly told rally-goers that the country was \"rounding the turn\" on the pandemic, a metaphor ready-made for La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway. \"This race track, look at this. It's perfect. We're rounding the curve. We will vanquish the virus.\" Both Biden and Mr. Trump are in Wisconsin on Friday. It's Biden's third trip since he secured the Democratic nomination and Mr.Trump's ninth campaign visit to the state since January 2019 and his fourth stop in October. The final Marquette University Law School poll before the election showed Biden leading Mr. Trump 48% to 43% among likely voters, a margin that has held relatively steady since the spring. The latest CBS News Battleground Tracker also shows Biden leading in Wisconsin by 6 points. Kind's challenger, Derrick Van Orden, argues that the fact that Mr. Trump is not a career politician, coupled with the signing of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will bolster his popularity in this part of the state, particularly among farmers and manufacturers.\u00a0 \"There's a tremendous amount of independents and former Democrats that have come up to me and said, 'we are supporting you because we know that you are going to put us first,'\" Van Orden said. \"And that's exactly the same reason that these former Democrats, or gee, some of them are current Democrats and independents are voting for President Trump this year.\" The president's reelection bid claims that more than half of those who registered online for his rally in West Salem are not listed as Republicans in their voter database, while just over a quarter did not vote in 2016.\u00a0 Voters like Ellen Sanson, a retired clinical laboratory scientist who lives in Lancaster, finds neither candidate appealing. She's voting for Mr. Trump: \"I'm going to go with the devil I know instead of the devil I don't.\"\u00a0 But she remarked, \"I don't think he's been bad for the country, but his mouth gets him in trouble.\" Sanson voted for Mr. Trump four years ago and said she likes what he did for the economy before the pandemic and his focus on the military. Biden is too old, she's decided, and she worries about running mate Kamala Harris' experience. There was one Democrat she would have voted for in November: Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar.\u00a0 In Juneau County, where Mr. Obama won by 7 points in 2012 and Mr. Trump by 26, artist Diane Dahl says she's tired of the political division. She rents space to the local Democratic Party in a building she owns, and has lost at least one prospective tenant because of it. \"One person has stopped to look at it and pretty much on the way out said, 'Well, if the Democrats would ever leave, let me know,'\" said Dahl, who voted for Biden. \"We have to stop the hate. We just have to stop this hate that is festering through the country.\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "For decades, the Republican Party lived by a creed, a model of decorum espoused by Ronald Reagan's so-called eleventh commandment: \"Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican.\"\u00a0 But that was before Donald Trump became president. Now, a band of lifelong Republicans is using the lessons they learned over 30 years as political strategists for the GOP to do more than criticize their party. Rather, they are actively working to defeat its incumbent president and Republican senators who support him.\u00a0 Called the Lincoln Project, the group was founded by eight men and women who had previously worked with Republicans such as Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and President George W. Bush. Although it has endorsed the Democratic presidential hopeful, former Vice President Joe Biden, the group has said they do not represent any particular candidate, campaign, or party.\u00a0 What the Lincoln Project does speak for is a feeling for some that the Republican Party has betrayed its longtime members. \"We've gone from caring about character, rule of law, defending the constitution, a cogent national security policy, free trade. Where are all those issues?\" said co-founder John Weaver, a strategist who previously worked with McCain and John Kasich. \"Imagine if you had traveled the country for 30 years, fighting for Republican principles, and you learn it was all a lie. No one cares about all the issues that we fought for.\" In an interview with 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl, members of the Lincoln Project explained what they see as the roots of the Republican Party's shift. For strategist John Weaver, the Freedom Caucus helped catalyze the Republican Party's transformation. Formed in 2015, the congressional caucus is made up of conservative Republican members of Congress who are often at odds with members of their own party. Among its founders are Rep. Jim Jordan, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, and former Director of the Office of Management and Budget and Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Weaver pointed to the group's opposition to a compromise immigration reform bill as what he said is a particular mistake. \"The party constantly lied about Obamacare, they constantly claimed they cared about the national debt, and meanwhile the national debt continued to go up while Republicans were in power,\" he said. \"And it made Republicans even more cynical, the Republican voters more cynical so that when Trump arrived, they were desperate for someone to wreck the system.\" But before the Freedom Caucus, Weaver told Stahl, another presidential contest marked a shift in the party \u2014 the 2008 campaign. The party had begun to change before that election, Weaver said, but McCain expedited the transformation when he selected former Alaska Gov. Sara Palin as his vice presidential running mate. \"It was a reality TV show choice,\" he said. \"It was a mistake.\" Lincoln Project co-founder Steve Schmidt was a senior campaign strategist and top adviser to McCain during his 2008 campaign. He told Stahl he, too, regrets that Palin was put on the ticket, even though he had originally encouraged McCain to select her. \"What you saw for the first time with Palin was someone who was breathtakingly dishonest not being held to account for her breathtaking dishonesty by a lot of news organizations, particularly those with a partisan agenda,\" he said. \"She was unfit in a profound level.\" Schmidt claims that, for years, Fox News and right-wing conservatives continued to use Palin to push the idea that science was irrelevant and credible news was \"fake.\" The effect, he said, was to energize other politicians like her.\u00a0 \"The category of people that we have seen in our politics over the last decade or so, from Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz, to Sarah Palin is part of the reason the country's politics are such a disaster,\" Schmidt said. \"And part of the reason the country's in such a mess.\" Rick Wilson, a media consultant and ad maker who worked for Republicans including Rudy Guiliani and President George H.W. Bush, feels Trump has set in motion a dark aspect of the Republican Party that had been lurking for years.\u00a0 \"There were parts of the GOP that we have to look at and be honest about what it was,\" Wilson told Stahl. \"We didn't, as a broad party, look at the people in parts of the base in the South and parts of the Midwest who were not motivated by free markets or limited government or individual liberty. They were motivated by racial animus. There is a part of it's out there. And we have to look at it honestly.\" Wilson pointed to President Ronald Reagan's unambiguous repudiation of the Ku Klux Klan. In a 1984 letter to Morris Abram, then-vice chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Reagan disassociated himself with the Klan and other hate groups, writing: The politics of racial hatred and religious bigotry practiced by the Klan and others have no place in this country, and are destructive of the values for which America has always stood\u2026 I firmly believe there is no room for partisanship on this question. Democrats and Republicans alike must be resolute in disassociating ourselves from any group or individual whose political philosophy consists only of racial or religious intolerance, whose arguments are supported only by intimidation or threats of violence. But, Wilson said, the Republican Party continued to tolerate members who subscribed to racist beliefs, leading Trump to, in Wilson's words, \"play footsie\" with them by not immediately denouncing former Klan leader David Duke in 2016.\u00a0 \"We should have purged them,\" Wilson said of the underbelly of racism among Republicans. \"We never did.\" 60 Minutes' Stahl pushed back, asking whether Wilson feels responsibility for previously promoting a party that had never fully eradicated racist elements. Wilson responded that, while he had never represented politicians with racist beliefs, he did work for candidates he feels \"ashamed\" of today. \"I helped elect Rudy Giuliani,\" he said. \"And he's gone off the rails, and not in a racial sense, but he's gone off the rails completely as this, you know, sort of conspirator in chief with Trump. It's sad.\" If Bernie Sanders had become the Democratic presidential nominee, would the Lincoln Project be doing what it is today?\u00a0 Former McCain advisor Steve Schmidt says yes.\u00a0 \"Because Bernie Sanders believes in American democracy,\" he said. \"He believes in American elections. He believes in the fairness of the election process. And that's what this is all about.\" While the members of the Lincoln Project say they disagree with Sanders on a host of issues, particularly his economic agenda, they all agreed that they would have supported him should he have been the candidate opposite Trump.\u00a0 \"He's not un-American. Donald Trump is fundamentally un-American\u2026\" Rick Wilson said. \"He doesn't believe in the role of a president as a leader of a nation. Instead, Donald Trump looks at the presidency as a way to enrich himself and aggrandize himself. And these are just fundamentally different categories.\" To watch Lesley Stahl's 60 Minutes report on the Lincoln Project, click here. The videos above were edited by Will Croxton.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Congressman Steve King was defeated Tuesday night in his bid for a tenth term, losing the Republican primary to Iowa State Senator Randy Feenstra, the Associated Press projects. Many Republicans declined to back King during the primary cycle.\u00a0 King, who was first elected to Congress in 2002, has drawn national scrutiny for years for his controversial remarks on issues such as\u00a0immigration,\u00a0abortion and saying it's \"not objectively true\" to consider every culture equal. But King's opponents didn't focus on that. Instead, they honed in on his waning influence in Washington.\u00a0 A January 2019\u00a0interview with The New York Times cost King his committee assignments after his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy drew\u00a0bipartisan condemnation. \"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\" King told The New York Times.\u00a0 Republicans who worked to unseat King jumped on his lack of a committee assignment, saying he doesn't have sway in Washington and can't deliver for his constituents. King claimed that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy would advocate for a return to his committee assignments, but McCarthy denied this and left the decision up to the Steering Committee.\u00a0 Feenstra's campaign manager\u00a0tweeted a photo on Tuesday night showing Feenstra on the phone with McCarthy and wrote in the caption, \"Randy is ready to get to work.\" \"I've said from day one that Iowans deserve a proven, effective conservative leader that will deliver results,\" Feenstra said in a\u00a0video. \"I promise you I will deliver results in Congress.\" In a\u00a0video posted on Facebook, King thanked his supporters, saying he conceded the race to Feenstra and \"pointed out that there's some powerful elements in the swamp that he's going to have an awfully hard time pushing back against.\" \"I would also point out that of all of the four opponents that I've had in this race, not one of them has raised an issue with a single vote I've put up or a single statement that I have made, and that's pretty interesting when you think of nearly 18 years in the United States Congress,\" King said. \"This comes from an effort to push out the strongest voice for full spectrum constitutional Christian conservatism that existed in the United States Congress.\" Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel congratulated Feenstra in a\u00a0tweet, and said King's \"white supremacist rhetoric is totally inconsistent with the Republican Party, and I'm glad Iowa Republicans rejected him at the ballot box.\" King has comfortably held his seat since 2002, often winning his races by double-digit margins. But King's three-point win in 2018 over first-time candidate, Democrat J.D. Scholten, was the closest general election challenge King faced in the reliably Republican district.\u00a0 Scholten is running again and some Republicans worried that if King was the nominee, it could give Democrats a chance to pick up a seat in a district where President Trump won by 27 points in 2016.\u00a0 In a statement Tuesday night, Scholten said his campaign \"defeated Steve King.\" \"Our campaign made King vulnerable and the swamp of corporate-lobbyists in D.C. that now supports Randy Feenstra had easy pickings,\" Scholten's statement added. \"King's defeat tonight marks a victory for all of us, and now we're pushing forward to November.\" The cash-strapped King had only about $32,000 on hand, according to the latest FEC filings, compared to Feenstra's $126,000. Feenstra spent more than $265,000 on television advertisements in the race, according to Kantar/CMAG data.\u00a0 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce invested $200,000 for advertisements, while other outside groups such as the Republican Jewish Coalition-Political Action Committee, Priorities for Iowa and the Defending Main Street super PAC also flooded the race with money going after King.\u00a0 Sarah Chamberlain, the Defending Main Street's treasurer, said they identified Feenstra as a good fit for the district early and brought him into their training school. Chamberlain called the mix of Feenstra as a candidate and King's lack of clout \"almost a perfect storm.\" \"I think educating the people of Iowa that [King] cannot vote in committees, is huge. I don't think a lot of people really focused on the real disadvantage of that. It's an agricultural district, and he doesn't sit on the Ag committee. So he doesn't write bills, he can only vote for them on the floor. That's a problem,\" she said, adding that they'll continue to support Feenstra in the general election.\u00a0 King has said his white nationalist comments in The New York Times were misquoted and \"weaponizing\" of the term. At a debate a week before the election, King said the backlash and his removal were \"ginned up\" by the \"Never Trumpers.\" On Election Day he\u00a0tweeted, \"Let's tell the Never-Trumpers We the People decide who represents us in Congress!\" There was a surge in absentee voting in the district and around Iowa compared to previous primaries after Iowa's Secretary of State mailed voters absentee ballot request forms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 61,000 Republicans voted absentee in the district, compared to about 6,300 who voted absentee during the 2018 primary. CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Kamala Harris' vice presidential candidacy is a litany of firsts. She is the first Black vice presidential candidate and first Asian American candidate on a presidential ticket of either party. While Harris' identity as a Black woman is well-known, less attention is paid to her Asian American identity. Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican-born father and a mother who emigrated from India to the U.S. Her first name, Kamala, is Sanskrit for \"lotus.\" Harris has often talked about her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who was active in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. \"I'm the daughter of a mother who broke down all kinds of barriers. Shyamala Harris was no more than 5 feet tall, but if you ever met her you would think she was seven feet tall. She had such spirit and tenacity and I'm thankful every day to have been raised by her,\" Harris wrote on Instagram in May. Harris also has ties to her relatives in India, as her mother often took her to India to visit their family there. In a recent interview with Reuters partner ANI, Harris' maternal uncle, Gopalan Balachandran, said Biden's announcement was a \"historic day for the Indian community.\" Harris' background may appeal to Asian American voters, who, according to the Pew Research Center, are the fastest growing demographic of eligible voters out of the major racial and ethnic groups in the United States. The 2016 post-election National Asian American Survey found that 1.1 million new Asian American voters cast a ballot in the last election. Indian Americans have voted Democratic in the past. In 2016, 69% of Asian Americans as a whole voted for Hillary Clinton, while 77% of Indian Americans voted for Clinton, according to NAAS. In 2018, 50% of Indian Americans identified themselves as Democrats, according to AAPI Data, which provides demographic data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\u00a0 \"I think even before the Harris pick, Asian Americans were probably going to be on track for record increases in voter turnout,\" said Karthick Ramakrishnan, professor of public policy and political science at the University of California, Riverside, and director of the National Asian American Survey. Concerns about COVID-19 has led researchers to wonder whether voter participation will be lower this year, Ramakrishnan told CBS News, but Biden's choice of Harris was likely to further inspire Asian American voters. \"I think the Harris nomination will very likely increase turnout in the Asian American population, and particularly among young Asian Americans and even more so Indian Americans,\" Ramakrishnan said. Ramakrishnan also noted that many key swing states in the 2020 election have high Asian American and Indian American populations. In Texas, 795,600 eligible voters make up 5.5% of the state's electorate. Out of that population, 161,326 are Indian American, according to AAPI Data. Asian Americans comprise 5.7% of the electorate in Minnesota, 4.7% in Georgia, 4.6% in Arizona and 3.7% in Florida. The 2018 Asian American Voter Survey, conducted by AAPI Data and APIA Vote, found that an increase in Asian American candidates was the main factor in the increase of civic participation by Asian American voters that year. \"When Asian Americans are on the ballot, more Asian American voters do come out. ... It can also be assumed that the Indian American community especially or South Asians will be interested in learning more about her as a candidate,\" said Madalene Xuan-Trang Mielke, the president and CEO of the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies, and the board of directors chair of ReflectUS, a non-partisan national coalition of women's organizations working to increase the number of women in office. President Trump has made overtures to Indian Americans in particular. He has a friendly relationship with Indian President Narendra Modi, and in September held a \"Howdy Modi\" rally in Houston that had around 50,000 attendees. Mr. Trump visited India in February, where he attended a massive rally. However, Ramakrishnan said that Trump administration policies to limit immigration, particularly the H1-B visa, could turn off Indian American voters. Ramakrishnan predicted that \"whatever headway\" the Trump campaign might have made with Indian American voters would likely be counteracted by Biden's choice of Harris as a running mate. Ramakrishnan said that Harris' nomination would likely be \"a net advantage for Democrats for many of these battleground states.\" She could also attract more young Asian American voters, a key constituency. As Asian Americans and Indian Americans already lean Democratic, Ramakrishnan said Harris' candidacy led to an \"acceleration of some trends that were already underway.\" Some Republicans in Mr. Trump's inner circle have also promoted the false claim that Harris is ineligible to be vice president, even though Harris was born in the United States. This echoes the false \"birther\" theory, supported by Mr. Trump, that questioned President Obama's citizenship. Mielke said that many Asian Americans have their citizenship questioned simply because of their appearance, calling it the \"perpetual foreigner myth that we constantly have to battle.\" She said that she hoped Harris' nomination would show that the children of immigrants are as American as anyone else. \"Being a child of immigrants, that is something that a lot of the community sees in themselves,\" Mielke said about Harris. Harris may also inspire more Asian Americans to run for office. A record number of Asian Americans and Indian Americans were elected to Congress in 2018. Mielke hopes that seeing representation at the highest level may encourage others to run. \"It's a really historic moment,\" Mielke said about Harris' nomination. \"I hope this opens the door for many more Asian American candidates and especially more Asian American and Pacific Islander women to run and feel that they have the access to do that.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "After an unorthodox drive-thru convention on Saturday, ex-Liberty University employee Bob Good claimed victory against Congressman Denver Riggleman. Riggleman is the third House incumbent to fall in their primary this cycle, as Good received 58% of the approximately 2,537 delegates who voted, beating the incumbent by\u00a0about 500 votes.\u00a0 In his first interview since the nominating convention, Riggleman told CBS News he is weighing the options on whether to challenge the results of what he called a \"rigged convention process.\"\u00a0 \"At some point, we really have to look at how these votes were actually counted and what the processes were,\" Riggleman said. \"For only 2,500 people to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of people like this is really egregious.\"\u00a0 In response to Riggleman's earlier claims of an improper election, Good responded \"that's what losers say\"  when the results were called early Sunday morning.\u00a0 Saturday's convention was held in the parking lot of Tree of Life Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, where registered delegates went through three steps and voted in their cars. Riggleman's team appealed the convention's location, noting the close proximity to Good's homebase. But the district's committee rejected it, and Melvin Adams, the district's Republican committee chair, noted it was a location that has been used for a convention before.\u00a0 Riggleman said he'll be taking the next couple of days to decide his next steps, and has not endorsed or conceded to Good. A campaign staffer said there have been calls for him to run as an independent \"from all over the district and the state,\" but no final decision has been made yet.\u00a0 \"I'm new to politics, but I'm not new to life. And I know corruption when I see it. We fought against that pretty hard and to see how this ended in really a rigged convention, that was ludicrous,\" Riggleman told CBS News. Riggleman claimed Good had campaign staffers on the district committee that pushed for a convention over a primary. Adams said that while it is necessary for committee members to disclose any affiliations to a campaign, it does not require them to recuse themselves from committee votes. \"There are so many nuances, 'if you're going to restrict this then what about that?' By the time you get done, well, then all the members of committees have to be detached from any campaigns or any active political engagement. That's counter productive,\" he told CBS News. Riggleman won this seat in 2018 and had the endorsement of President Trump, who won the district by double digits in 2016. But he came\u00a0close to being censured\u00a0after he officiated a gay wedding between two former campaign volunteers. Good used this issue of marriage equality, as well as abortion and immigration, to paint Riggleman as out of line with conservatives in the district. Good did not respond to CBS News for a comment on this story.\u00a0 Democrats have argued that Good's lack of name recognition, low fundraising numbers and views on social issues have put this district more at play. Riggleman agreed, and said Good's hardline stances hurts any efforts to broaden the tent of the Republican party. \"I'm the only one who can win this district for the Republicans. The president knew that and a lot of other people knew that, too. Good's just completely out of touch with the fifth district.\" he said. \"We want a Republican Party that stays out of our business, out of our pocketbooks, but also out of our bedrooms.\" Four Democrats will be in the primary for this seat that will be held on June 23: Entrepreneur and past 2018 primary candidate R.D. Huffstetler, local school board member John Lesinski, veteran Claire Russo and healthy policy instructor at the University of Virginia Cameron Webb. The last Democrat to win this seat was Tom S.P. Perriello in 2008.\u00a0 Whether Good's name will be on the November ballot is in the air, as it was revealed Friday afternoon he had not submitted the correct paperwork in time. The state's Republican party sent a letter to their Board of Elections asking for an extension to be granted for Good's case, as well as candidate\u00a0Nick Freitas in Virginia's 7th. Good's campaign said they were able to file the correct forms in the 10-day grace period and were confident they'd be on the ballot, though the State Board of Elections will make an ultimate call on the extension on July 7. \u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "The battleground state of Wisconsin was ordered to remove more than 200,000 people from its voter registration lists. A judge said they may have moved, but Democrats fear this will unfairly affect votes. One reason it flipped red in 2016 is because of low turnout, despite a strong turnout for Barack Obama.  President Donald Trump won the state in 2016 by fewer than 23,000 votes, partly because of his surprise victory in Racine County. President Obama won the county in 2008 and 2012. Turnout among black Wisconsinites fell nearly 19% between the 2012 and 2016 elections. Racine Democrat Corey Prince with the NAACP said voters didn't turn out for Hillary Clinton because of a \"lack of organizing.\" \"Black people have realized \u2026 our vote is being taken for granted,\" he told CBS News correspondent Adriana Diaz.  \"There's a democratic America that looks at Donald Trump as like he's the worst thing ever,\" Prince said. \"Black people are kind of like 'yawn, you know, I've seen worse' \u2026 We see Donald when we go to the bank and ask for a loan, we see Donald when we get pulled over \u2026 and so Donald ain't that bad to us. He's not the worst. We would love to get behind something better. Give us that picture, give us the picture of something better, don't talk about what's so bad.\" UP CLOSE: Pres.

In 2016, city turnout was just under 52%. Out in the suburbs, it was 70%.  At a country club, several people were playing the Chinese game of mahjong, and most didn't want to talk politics, but life-long Republican Mary Patterson shared what issues she cares most about.  \"Immigration is very important to me. I would like to see something done with health care,\" she said. \"And also foreign policy.\" Asked what she thought about Mr. Trump's decision to order the recent drone strike that killed a top Iranian genera, Patterson said she thinks it was the right thing to do.\u00a0 \"Iran is going to back off, and with this president they know he won't hesitate,\" she said.\u00a0 Further west, in Burlington, it seemed like the whole town showed up for an open mic night. Stefanie Cimoli, a military wife, said she has traditionally voted Republican. \"But I need to just get a better grasp on what the candidates have to offer and what I feel is important to me,\" she said. \"My vote's up for grabs.\"\u00a0 Cimoli said she voted for Clinton in 2016. \"I might get some flak,\" she said, looking at the friends she was with. \"I just try to vote my heart, vote my conscience. What I feel is best for my family, best for the country,\" she said. Both parties have their sights set on these voters. Mr. Trump has his rally in nearby Milwaukee Tuesday night. And the Democrats are holding their national convention this summer in Milwaukee.  Wisconsin's primary is April 7.",

            "article_content": "In an election cycle expected to have record Hispanic turnout, a conservative Hispanic group is endorsing three incumbent Republican senators facing high-profile reelection battles. The conservative LIBRE Initiative Action PAC is rolling out endorsements for incumbent Senators Cory Gardner in Colorado, Thom Tillis in North Carolina, and John Cornyn in Texas. \"We feel we can make a difference in these three Senate races given the numbers of Latinos in those states and, of course, how close the Senate races are going to be,\" the initiative's senior adviser Daniel Garza told CBS News. The LIBRE Initiative Action, a part of the conservative Koch network, in memos to its supporters touted the senators' work to lower taxes and fix the immigration system. The memos also detail support for the CARES Act, which expanded access to telemedicine, and the senators' efforts to allow individual patients to pick the insurance best for them. All of the senators voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act ,which has seen more buy-ins during the coronavirus pandemic as workers who have lost jobs no longer have access to employer-based insurance. The state governments in Texas and North Carolina have not expanded Medicaid, which would provide insurance to millions whose incomes don't currently qualify them for Medicaid. \u00a0 \"What we're looking to do is to move away from more government-controlled decisions on behalf of the consumer, making sure that instead of centralizing health care decisions, that we actually empower the individual,\" Garza said. CBS News polling has consistently found that healthcare is one of the top issues for all voters. An October 2019 poll found that more than 4 in 10 Americans said the healthcare system needs fundamental changes, and 43%\u00a0 said paying for basic health care is a hardship.\u00a0 The LIBRE Initiative Action was founded in 2011 as a conservative group, but has strayed from the base on a few issues. The group has supported giving permanent status to Dreamers and has also criticized the administration's tariffs on China. In the Texas primaries, LIBRE Action\u00a0endorsed incumbent U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat to help fend off his progressive challenger, Jessica Cisneros. For the newly-released Senate endorsements, the initiative will dispatch its field workers to make video conferences, phone calls and social media to campaign in Hispanic communities. \u00a0 The Pew Research Center projects there will be 32 million Hispanics eligible to vote in 2020, which would surpass the African-American population for the first time to become the nation's largest racial or ethnic minority during a U.S. presidential election. The growth of the Hispanic population is visible in the three states targeted by LIBRE Action's endorsements. Analysis from Univision released in 2019 showed Hispanic voters played a decisive role in the 2018 midterms, with turnout on average doubling between 2014 and 2018 in seven states, including Colorado and North Carolina. In Colorado, all political parties saw higher Hispanic turnout with the \"Independent/Other\" category having the highest at 74%. The turnout in North Carolina skewed more Democratic. The Republican party saw a 47% increase in Hispanic voter turnout versus a 115% for Democrats.\u00a0 Texas, which was not included in the Univision analysis, has the second-highest number of eligible Hispanic voters at 5.6 million, according to analysis from the Pew Research Center. \u00a0\u00a0 But LIBRE is not yet weighing in on Arizona, a state with a competitive Senate match-up where Hispanic turnout is influential. Senator Martha McSally is facing a special election in November against former astronaut Mark Kelly. Univision data shows Hispanic turnout more than doubled from 2014 to 2018, and both Republicans and Democrats saw significant growth. When asked about the race, Garza said, \"What we looked at was, can we make a difference in the race? Is there enough alignment with the policy champions? And then, of course, with the limited amount of resources that we have \u2026 we're focusing on these three races.\" CBS News reporter covering the Pentagon.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Former President Barack Obama delivered his long-awaited endorsement of Joe Biden for president on Tuesday, recording an 12-minute video to throw his support behind his former vice president. Mr. Obama's endorsement of his former vice president comes a day after Senator Bernie Sanders gave a full-throated endorsement of Biden's presidential bid, ending speculation that the two rivals might remain at odds going into the general election season. \"I'm so proud to endorse Joe Biden to be president of the United States,\" Mr. Obama said. \"Choosing Joe to be my vice president was one of the best decisions I ever made, and he became a good friend. And I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now.\" Mr. Obama praised Biden's actions during his administration, such as assisting in the financial recovery after the Great Recession and spearheading the response to the H1N1 pandemic. He also called for Biden's platform to go further to the left on certain issues, such as providing a public health insurance option for all Americans and expanding green initiatives to combat climate change. Mr. Obama also hailed the field of former candidates for the nomination, especially Sanders, whom he called \"an American original.\" He urged fervent Sanders supporters to coalesce behind Biden. \"We both know that nothing is more powerful than millions of voices calling for change. And the ideas he's championed, the energy and enthusiasm he inspired, especially in young people, will be critical in moving America in a direction of progress and hope,\" Mr. Obama said, referring to the Vermont senator. The former president also spoke to Democratic voters wary of Biden by highlighting disagreements with President Trump and the Republican Party. \"Of course, Democrats may not always agree on every detail of the best way to bring about each and every one of these changes. But we do agree that they're needed. And that only happens if we win this election,\" Mr. Obama said. \"Because one thing everybody has learned by now is that the Republicans occupying the White House and running the U.S. Senate are not interested in progress. They're interested in power.\" Mr. Obama implicitly criticized Mr. Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying \"pandemics have a way of cutting through a lot of noise and spin to remind us of what is real, and what is important.\" \"This crisis has reminded us that government matters. It's reminded us that good government matters. That facts and science matter. That the rule of law matters. That having leaders who are informed, and honest, and seek to bring people together rather than drive them apart - those kind of leaders matter,\" Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama's backing has been long expected and inevitable, but the former president has resisted engaging publicly in the presidential contest, preferring to allow 2020 candidates to make their case. Since the first day of his campaign last April, Biden has maintained he asked Mr. Obama not to endorse him, saying he wanted to \"earn this on my own.\" Biden has said he has been consulting with Mr. Obama since March about the process for picking his running mate. While Mr. Obama was not on the campaign trail, some of the loudest cheers at Biden's rallies throughout the primary process came when he mentioned his former boss. Biden proudly defended Mr. Obama's legacy from some of his rivals for the Democratic nomination, who\u00a0criticized the pair for their record on issues like immigration and health care while in the White House.",

            "article_content": "In the final stretch of the campaign, we find three Southern battlegrounds that could still go either way. Our estimates show Joe Biden with just a two-point edge over President Trump in Florida, Biden up four points in North Carolina, and the contest even in Georgia.\u00a0 Millions have already voted and many others say they've already decided. While early voters in each state told us they substantially favored Biden, those who have not yet voted heavily favor Mr. Trump, setting up a key turnout test running now through Election Day for both parties. Each side has very different views about the nature of the problems facing the country, which is one reason there doesn't appear to be much room for people to change their minds now. In one example, most Trump voters are worried the country will become too socialist. Most Biden voters worry the country will become too authoritarian. And very different views on the coronavirus pandemic still shape the race in all these states. In all, most Biden voters are very concerned about getting it, and Mr. Trump's voters, by comparison, are far less concerned. Biden also gets better marks overall on how he would handle the outbreak. Each set of supporters also has different criteria shaping their vote. Biden voters are more likely to say that a candidate's personal character is a major factor in it. In Florida, for example, eight in 10 Biden voters say it is \u2014 compared to just 35% of Trump voters. For Trump voters, the economy and immigration are the major factors.\u00a0 And while the economy continues to be an area where the president does better than Biden, it's not enough to propel him into a vote preference lead, at least not yet.\u00a0 And Biden leads among voters who have already cast their ballot, while Mr. Trump leads among likely voters who have yet to vote.\u00a0 White voters:\u00a0In each of these states, Biden's share of the White vote is currently larger than Clinton's was in 2016. And there has been a shift among White voters with college degrees in particular \u2014 a pattern we've seen across the battleground states. In 2016, Mr. Trump won this group by double digits in all three states. Now Biden leads among them in North Carolina, is neck and neck with Mr. Trump in Florida, and has dramatically reduced the president's margin in Georgia.\u00a0 Biden currently leads among White women with college degrees in Florida and North Carolina, and across all three states, it's not the lead that tells the story, it's the\u00a0shifts\u00a0from four years ago that does. Biden's 52% in Florida is up from 37% that Clinton got; his 45% in Georgia up from 34% from Clinton; his 56% in North Carolina is 11 points better than Clinton. In Georgia, White voters without college degrees \u2014 both men and women \u2014 tend to like how Mr. Trump handles himself personally and dislike Biden's approach. These voters were a big part of Mr. Trump's winning coalition in 2016, and they continue to back him in strong numbers. White evangelicals, who made up more than a third of the electorate in Georgia and North Carolina in 2016, continue to support the president by large majorities in these states. Black and Hispanic voters:\u00a0In Florida, Biden's support among Black voters (92%), is higher than the 84% who backed Clinton \u2014 and a bit closer to Barack Obama's margins in 2008 and 2012. In Georgia and North Carolina, Biden is getting a level of Black voter support similar to what Clinton's was. Biden continues to lead among Latino voters in Florida by a margin similar to Clinton's.\u00a0 Seniors and young voters:\u00a0Biden is cutting into Mr. Trump's 2016 margins with seniors in Florida and Georgia, cutting the president's 2016 advantage in half. In North Carolina, Biden has a two-point edge with seniors, a group Mr. Trump won by 23 points in 2016. Other voter groups have shifted, too. Though they traditionally make up a smaller voting block than older voters, there is also a larger shift among younger voters in Florida to the Democratic column. Biden leads by 39 points among voters under 30, which is more than double Hillary Clinton's 18-point advantage among this group four years ago. Urbanity:\u00a0The more diverse urban areas of these states favor Biden, while rural areas favor Mr. Trump, with the suburbs a battleground in which younger, non-White voters are mostly voting for Joe Biden and older White voters are voting for Mr. Trump.\u00a0 As we've seen in other battlegrounds, more like the way Biden handles himself personally than say that about Mr. Trump. This is in contrast to the 2016 campaign when both presidential candidates were viewed negatively. In North Carolina, where Biden has an edge, most voters who backed Mr. Trump in 2016 like how the president handles himself personally. But among those who do not, Mr. Trump loses 31% of them to Biden, a higher defection rate than the other two states.\u00a0 But in these states there are about one in five voters who dislike the way the president handles himself personally but are voting for him anyway. For these voters, the economy is paramount for them, it is the top factor in their vote \u2014 far ahead of personal character \u2014 and they overwhelmingly think Mr. Trump would do a better job handling it.\u00a0 On personal characteristics, Mr. Trump gets relatively high marks on being strong, but low on being compassionate. Biden gets higher numbers on being compassionate and respectful. Slightly more voters describe Biden as truthful than Mr. Trump, but in none of these states do a majority of voters call either candidate truthful.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's \"law and order\" message is resonating with many White voters, but Black voters react differently. When he talks about \"law and order,\" half of Whites in North Carolina and nearly two-thirds in Georgia feel like he is trying to protect people like them, but more than seven in 10 Black voters feel he is trying to make things more dangerous for people like them. The president has been trying to win over suburban women voters with this \"law and order\" message, but most suburban women in Georgia and North Carolina, with whom Biden leads overall, don't think Mr. Trump is trying to protect people like them when he talks about it. Those supporting the president do, but on balance, fewer than half agree.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's voters, perhaps in keeping with his campaign's message, overwhelmingly believe that Biden's family profited from Biden being vice president. Biden's voters, in turn, think that Mr. Trump's family has profited from his time in office. Independents are more mixed about each of them, and the views correlate with vote, suggesting that perhaps these themes are resonating with each set of existing supporters. Republican senators are playing defense in the key battlegrounds of North Carolina and Georgia. In North Carolina, Republican Senator Thom Tillis continues to trail Democrat Cal Cunningham, but the race has tightened since we last polled this race in September. Cunningham is now ahead by six points, down from the 10-point lead he enjoyed last month, as Tillis picked up some support from undecided voters. Neither candidate has an edge when it comes to how they handle themselves personally, with most voters disliking how each of the candidates behaves. But one possible bright spot for Cunningham: more North Carolinians want to see Republican members of Congress be more independent from Mr. Trump than be more in agreement with him. The Georgia Senate race is nearly tied now, with Republican Senator David Perdue ahead of Democrat Jon Ossoff by just one point. Ossoff has shored up support with Democrats and liberals since September, but he's also been able to pick up some moderate voters in the past few weeks. More Georgia voters want to see Republicans in Congress be more independent from the president than in agreement with him, with more than half of moderates saying so. These surveys were conducted on behalf of CBS News by YouGov between October 20-23, 2020. They are based on representative samples of 1,243 registered voters in Florida, 1,102\u00a0 in Georgia, and 1,037 in North Carolina. Margins of error for likely voters are \u00b13.6 points in Florida, \u00b13.4 points in Georgia, and \u00b14.1 points. Toplines: Florida Georgia North Carolina",

            "article_content": "A group of U.S. Black scholars, activists and writers has launched a new project to combat misleading information online around voting, reparations and immigration, supporters announced\u00a0Friday. The National Black Cultural Information Trust seeks to counter trolls on Twitter and other social media platforms that attempt to discourage Black voters from participating in elections or seek to turn Black voters against other communities of color, such as Hispanics or Asian Americans. Teach-ins, webinars, workshops and town hall discussions will be hosted by the NBCIT to strengthen public awareness, according to the release. A CBS\u00a0Battleground Tracker poll\u00a0from August shows that 90% of Black likely voters nationwide plan to cast their ballot for Democrat Joe Biden.\u00a0 Jessica Ann Mitchell Aiwuyor, an African American activist and scholar and the project's founder, said some dubious accounts behind the #ADOS movement \u2014 which stands for American Descendants of Slavery \u2014 on social media have urged Black voters to skip the presidential election. Some accounts also use the movement's hashtag to enflame supposed divisions between African Americans and Black immigrants from the Caribbean and Latin America, Aiwuyor said. Most recently, some social media users have used #ADOS to blame Somali immigrants in Minneapolis for the May 2020 death of George Floyd rather than Derek Chauvin, the police officer charged with killing him. \"The disinformation used to target Black communities is cultural,\" said Aiwuyor. \"It's cultural disinformation, which uses cultural issues to infuse false information and cause confusion.\" #ADOS leader Antonio Moore met with Ice Cube and celebrated a mention from him. Turns out, he's working with MAGA. We're not surprised at all. This further confirms #ADOSisMAGA. https://t.co/uvihZSYVoy Aiwuyor is a former communications director for the National Fair Housing Alliance who has helped file racial discrimination lawsuits against Facebook, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank.\u00a0 Aiwuyor said some social media accounts are using \"digital Blackface\" \u2014 posing as Black users when they aren't \u2014 or resurrecting old accounts that haven't tweeted in four years to spread false information about where to vote and where candidates stand on issues. \"It's critical to understand how misinformation and disinformation affects the Black community specifically concerning how cultural issues are used by bad actors to infuse false information,\" Aiwuyor said in a statement. \"We're being manipulated and influenced, not just concerning social issues, but also concerning how we think about our lives, our cultures, and ourselves.\"\u00a0 Members of the National Black Cultural Information Trust plan to monitor social media posts and flag those spreading misleading and fake stories. They plan to use crowdsourcing, as well as website tools that show if accounts have troll-like behavior, and scholars on standby to counter any claims about slavery or voting. Through its website, the project will direct users to discussions and stories around Black voting and reparation supporters.",

            "article_content": "Facebook has removed 216 Trump ads that claimed \"despite the health risks [of] COVID-19 Joe Biden will increase refugees\" from Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\u00a0 \"We rejected these ads because we don't allow claims that people's physical safety, health, or survival is threatened by people on the basis of their national origin or immigration status,\" a Facebook spokesperson told CBS News via email. The Facebook\u00a0ad library for the Donald J. Trump Facebook page shows Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. paid $10,000 to $15,000 for the 15-second video messages that started to run on September 30. The ad library, which lists ads purchased by the Trump campaign, shows 216 ads used the \"creative and text\" before they were taken down by Facebook that same day \"because it goes against Facebook Advertising Policies.\" The ads received 300,000 to 350,000 impressions before they were removed, according to the ad library.\u00a0 A similar 30-second version of the ad, however,\u00a0was not removed, a Facebook spokesperson pointed out to CBS News. Facebook didn't say why the 15-second version was taken down but not the longer one, only noting that the ads were different.\u00a0 Courtney Parella, the deputy national press secretary for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., echoed the sentiment in the ads in a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday and stood behind them. She also said: \"When it comes to leading our nation through this crisis and delivering the Great American Comeback, Americans can rely on President Trump.\" The United States has reported more cases of the coronavirus than any other country in the world, with over 7.2 million total cases and 207,000 deaths, according to a tally from\u00a0Johns Hopkins University. Mr. Trump has in the past blamed the coronavirus on other countries \u2013 often calling it the \"China virus,\" which many have deemed a racial slur. The 30-second ad that remains on Facebook does not mention China by name, but does include the Chinese flag over a \"COVID-19\" graphic.\u00a0 Facebook's advertising policies state that ads \"must not contain content that asserts or implies personal attributes,\" including \"direct or indirect assertions or implications about a person's race, ethnic origin, religion, beliefs, age, sexual orientation or practices, gender identity, disability, medical condition (including physical or mental health), financial status, membership in a trade union, criminal record, or name.\" The company's decision to remove the Trump campaign ads come amid a broader focus on content related to the presidential election.\u00a0 In September, Facebook said it will block campaigns from advertising in the week before the November 3 vote and that it is seeking to remove posts with \"clear misinformation\" about the coronavirus pandemic and voting. It also said it will reject any political ads that claim victory in the presidential election before the results are declared \u2013 a reversal for the company which has long said it won't fact-check political ads made by presidential candidates and other international leaders.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is visiting Florida for the first time as the Democratic presidential nominee, amid questions about his ability to garner support from Latino voters, a crucial voting bloc in the Sunshine State. Biden will mark Hispanic Heritage Month in an event in Kissimmee on Tuesday evening. \"I will talk about how I am going to work like the devil to make sure I turn every Latino and Hispanic vote,\" Biden told reporters on Monday about his plans for his trip to Florida. The former vice president also said that his overall support among Latino voters is \"much higher\" than support for Mr. Trump, but he acknowledged \"they've got to go higher.\" Although Biden could still win the White House without Florida,\u00a0CBS News digital politics reporter Grace Segers\u00a0reports\u00a0the state is considered a linchpin for President Trump, who won its 29 electoral votes in 2016. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has committed to spending $100 million in the state to aid Biden. However, Biden's support appears to be slipping among Latino voters, who make up roughly 26% of the state's population. An\u00a0NBC News/Marist College poll\u00a0released earlier this month showed Biden lagging behind Mr. Trump among likely Latino voters, receiving 46% support from likely Latino voters compared to 50% support for Mr. Trump.\u00a0Exit polls\u00a0from 2016 showed that the majority of Latinos in the state backed Hillary Clinton, although Cubans were about twice as likely to support Mr. Trump as non-Cuban Latinos. Although Biden may have an uphill battle to attract Cuban voters, he has sought to strengthen his support among Puerto Rican voters, who also make up a significant portion of the population in Florida. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny allowed the Biden campaign to use his music in an ad which is airing in Pennsylvania and Florida. Biden has also harshly criticized Mr. Trump's response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017. Others have questioned whether the Biden campaign is doing enough to reach out to the Latino community. Chuck Rocha, a former senior adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns,\u00a0told CBSN on Monday\u00a0that Biden was lagging among Latino voters in part because of \"a lack of money\" from his campaign on Latino outreach. \"The fact of the matter is there's just not money going to take that message to Latinos as there needs to be,\" Rocha said. Javier Fernandez, a Democrat running for the state Senate in Miami-Dade County, told\u00a0CBS Miami\u00a0that there did not seem to be much enthusiasm for Biden among Latino voters in Florida. \"I don't know that they're super excited about Joe Biden,\" Fernandez said. Mr. Trump has also been working to appeal to Latino voters in recent weeks. He participated in a Latinos for Trump roundtable in Phoenix on Monday. Although some Latino voters are wary of Mr. Trump because of his anti-immigration policies, Biden has also faced criticism because of the high number of deportations implemented by the Obama administration. Biden\u00a0has said that he regrets\u00a0the deportations of migrants without criminal records under President Obama. Biden also attended an event with veterans in Tampa on Tuesday. Biden, whose son served in the military, slammed Mr. Trump's \"degradation of service members.\" A\u00a0poll by Monmouth University\u00a0released on Tuesday found that Mr. Trump leads Biden by just four percentage points in military households in Florida. Over one-third of the state's electorate lives in military or veteran households. As the battle for the nation's sliver of persuadable voters continues in earnest ahead of Election Day, the Trump campaign is back on the airwaves in Pennsylvania and Arizona - two states that begin early voting on October 7 and October 19, respectively.\u00a0CBS news campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports this week's $12.8 million local television investment also buys the Trump campaign time in Florida, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Georgia, Maine and Nebraska, according to data from Kantar/CMAG. As polling shows the president's messaging on safety and security\u00a0continuing to fall flat, his re-election bid has shifted its focus from Mr. Trump's \"Law and Order\" mantra to the economy, touting\u00a0job creation\u00a0and\u00a0record unemployment numbers\u00a0among women and minority voters in new 30-second spots. Campaign surrogates have also followed suit. \"President Trump knew exactly what to do to bring to us unprecedented prosperity,\" former Attorney General Jose Fuentes told reporters on a Trump campaign call, Tuesday. \"Before the economy was artificially interrupted by the coronavirus outbreak, Latino unemployment reached a near record low 3.4%.\" Yet joblessness today for Hispanic workers in the U.S. lingers just above 10% - higher than the 7.3% unemployment rate for White workers, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics. Two weeks out from the first head-to-head matchup between President Trump and Joe Biden,\u00a0Sganga\u00a0also reports the president has not begun official debate preparation. \"I sort of prepare every day just doing what I'm doing,\" the president told Fox News Tuesday. Mr. Trump later added, \"I don't know which Biden is going to show up,\" in reference to the former vice president's uneven performances during Democratic primary debates. Ahead of Biden's trip to Tampa, the Biden campaign kicked off Hispanic Heritage Month with a press call Tuesday afternoon, speaking to reporters about its rollout of what it's billing as a \"compassionate\" comprehensive plan for Puerto Rico. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the campaign said the goal is to ensure that Puerto Rico has the resources needed to rebuild its infrastructure and to restore hope on the island. \"Whether you live in Reading, Pennsylvania, Kissimmee, Florida, or San Juan, Puerto Rico, you deserve a fair return for your work and an equal chance to get ahead, and a government that treats every American citizen equally and has their back when you get knocked down,\" said deputy campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez during the call. Other aspects of the plan include allowing Puerto Ricans to determine what their status should be; providing investments to critical infrastructure to aid the island's reconstruction efforts; and ensuring that families on the island have access to the same quality health care and nutrition resources that any other U.S. region would receive. The campaign also said a Biden administration would create a working group composed of local stakeholders and representatives of Puerto Rico and members from the administration, to help ensure that the island receives existing resources and that the resources are dispersed throughout the island. Biden campaign Florida coalitions director Javier Cuervas called it \"a historical day for Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican community,\" and added that \"no president or presidential candidate has ever provided a plan as comprehensive\" as Biden's. Though today marks Biden's first in-person campaign stop in Florida as the Democratic presidential nominee.\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0notes that his campaign has hosted virtual events and launched ads appealing to Puerto Rican communities. In the\u00a0newest episode\u00a0of \"The Debrief with Major Garrett,\"\u00a0CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett\u00a0chronicles the past six months in the pandemic-plagued sports world. The delay of sports because of the pandemic led to a mega sports equinox on September 10 when all of the four major leagues - NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL - and a number of other sports competed on the same day.\u00a0 Athletes across the leagues have returned with calls for social justice and racial justice in the wake of George Floyd's death at the hands of a police officer during the pandemic. \"People expecting right now for sports to be some sort of a diversion from this horrible pandemic, got a rude awakening, because not only are people of color who make up the most of the sports that we watch the most, particularly football and basketball...,\" Washington Post Columnist Kevin Blackistone said. \"Not only are people of color predominant there, but they are also, unfortunately, the predominant victims of this pandemic, and so they're feeling it on both ends.\" The episode also features interviews with Boston Celtics player Enes Kanter,\u00a0CBS Saturday Morning co-host Dana Jacobson, USA Today sports columnist Christine Brennan and others. The Michigan Senate passed a bill on Tuesday that would allow clerks to start processing absentee ballots one day before the general election, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The bill would allow clerks in cities with at least 25,000 people to do some pre-processing activities on Monday, such as opening envelopes, but would require ballots to remain in their secrecy sleeves. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson called it a \"step in the right direction\" but said the bill \"does not go nearly far enough\" to provide help for clerks. \"I support the small step forward because I know at this point clerks will take any legislative assistance. But the bill comes up far short of what our clerks and voters deserve,\" Benson said in a statement. \"This bill allows only ten hours, only minimal processing, and includes a sunset provision that requires clerks to continue their advocacy in years to come. Ultimately, it does a disservice to the 1,500 election officials who work tirelessly for their communities and our democracy, and doesn't do enough to bring about more timely election results.\" The bill passed 34-2. It now goes to the Michigan House. In a lawsuit brought by the Ohio Democratic Party against Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Franklin County judge ruled in favor of the Ohio Democratic Party, writing that LaRose did not have the legal authority to issue a directive limiting each of Ohio's county boards of elections to only one ballot drop box per county. \"No statute says that delivery must occur with only one box per county. No statute says that delivery would be improper to be a drop box controlled by a board and placed at a safe location separate and apart from the main board office,\" the judge wrote. \"The statute is silent on such matters. The Secretary cannot slip new words into the law.\" CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says the judge also wrote that LaRose's counsel noted that if the state ruled that additional drop boxes are required, LaRose's office would need to implement the ruling. \"The Secretary has stated publicly he supports additional drop boxes if they are legal; and his lawyer represented on the record in the Northern District of Ohio that his client would abide by a state court ruling,\" the judge wrote. Maggie Sheehan, LaRose's spokesperson, said in a statement that LaRose's directive will remain in place. She also noted that the secretary's office will appeal the ruling at the earliest possible opportunity. \"Importantly, while the judge issued a declaration as to the law regarding the return of absentee ballots and drop boxes, he did not rule on the Plaintiff's request to enjoin the Secretary's Directive,\" Sheehan said. \"Lacking that, today's ruling didn't change anything and the Secretary's Directive remains in place.\" NORTH CAROLINA Republican Senator Thom Tillis and Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham faced off in the first debate for the general election Monday night. In the debate, Cunningham said he would not necessarily take a vaccine if one was offered, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. He told the moderator, \"Yes, I would be hesitant, but I'm going to ask a lot of questions,\" adding, \"I think that's incumbent on all of us right now.\" According to\u00a0Joe Bruno of WSOC TV,\u00a0Cunningham said after the debate that he would take the vaccine if the FDA signs off on it and it is free of politics. Monday's debate featured questions over how each candidate would ameliorate the suffering North Carolinians are experiencing because of coronavirus. The debate came 10 days after the state started sending out ballots to voters. The candidates were asked if they trust mail-in voting. Tillis said he trusts the system in North Carolina and will vote absentee, and Cunningham said he trusts the vote-by-mail system but plans to vote in-person next month. MESSAGING The House GOP unveiled its 2021 agenda less than 50 days before election day, should it take back the House, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Its \"Commitment to America\" plan focuses, in part, on getting a COVID-19 vaccine developed this year, increasing police funding by more than $1.75 billion and cutting American dependence on China. \"We cannot slow the progress of America's ingenuity or allow our science to be politicized,\" the plan says, adding that there should be investments in therapeutics and protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions. Some of these themes, such as supporting law enforcement, have already made their debut in House GOP campaign ads. In an\u00a0appearance\u00a0on the Capitol steps, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other GOP leadership described a need to return to a pre-COVID America, while also slamming Democrats. \"Two years ago, Speaker Pelosi promised the American people that Democrats would serve a responsibility to seek common ground. And she did the complete opposite,\" McCarthy said, before hitting House Democrats for impeachment and holding up COVID-19 legislation with their \"liberal wish list.\" Republicans need a net gain of 17 seats in order to flip the House, a task made harder by consistently high Democrat incumbent fundraising and a dispersed battlefield. Republican Mike Garcia, who helped cut that gap down by flipping a seat in California during a May special election, called the commitment a \"renewal of national pride.\" The plan's\u00a0one-page memo\u00a0also talks about reaching \"bipartisan consensus to protect and strengthen Social Security,\" something House Democrats have been attacking Republicans on due to Mr.\u00a0Trump's payroll tax deferral. House Democratic campaign chair Cheri Bustos criticized House Republicans for \"downplay[ing] the severity of COVID-19\" and for opposing the\u00a0HEROES Act, a COVID-19 relief bill that's stalled since it passed in May. \"The only roadmap Kevin McCarthy needs is a straight line to Mitch McConnell's office to demand he take up bipartisan House-passed legislation to support American workers and rebuild our economy,\" Bustos said in a statement.",

            "article_content": "The Republican National Convention kicked off Monday with several surprise appearances by President Trump and a message that his reelection is the only way to keep America safe from crime and the coronavirus. Earlier in the day, the Republican Party\u00a0formally nominated Mr. Trump\u00a0in the roll call.\u00a0 The convention's theme for the first night was \"Land of Promise.\" A video featuring Mr. Trump with essential workers in the White House marked the president's first surprise appearance of the night. Several speakers during the event thanked Mr. Trump for his response to the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. In another surprise, Mr. Trump appeared in another video from the White House Diplomatic Room with six Americans who had been held hostage by U.S. adversaries: Michael White, Sam Goodwin, Pastor Andrew Brunson, Joshua and Tamara Holt and Pastor Bryan Nerran. Each of the former hostages were freed during the Trump administration. Two marquee speakers were Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who were photographed pointing guns at Black Lives Matter protesters. \"Make no mistake: No matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats' America,\" Patricia McCloskey said. Donald Trump, Jr., and his girlfriend, former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, both highlighted talking points on the economy, calling Democrats \"socialists\" and castigating the \"cancel culture.\"\u00a0 Two Republicans from South Carolina, Senator Tim Scott and former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, closed out the convention by sounding a different note about America's promise. And the two, who are both politicians of color, decisively rejected the politics and policies of Democrats and Joe Biden. \"There are millions of families like mine across this nation, full of potential seeking to live the American Dream,\" Scott said. \"And I'm here tonight to tell you that supporting the Republican ticket gives you the best chance of making that dream a reality.\" \u00a0Charlie Kirk, the founder of conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, kicked off the evening's program with an ominous warning to voters, casting the November election as \"a decision between preserving America as we know it, and eliminating everything we love.\" \"Trump is the bodyguard of western civilization,\" Kirk said. \"Trump was elected to protect our families from the vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, church, and values. President Trump was elected to defend the American way of life.\" Kirk characterized Mr. Trump as \"the guardian of America,\" and said he is \"shielding the innocent from the selfish ambition of the selfish elites.\"\u00a0 One of Mr. Trump's most fervent defenders on Capitol Hill, Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida, began his remarks with a dig at Biden, saying he is delivering his remarks \"from an auditorium emptier than Joe Biden's daily schedule.\" Gaetz warned that casting a vote for Biden will effectively be handing power to progressives such as Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, from New York, and like Kirk painted a dark picture of the country under a Biden administration.\"Settle for Biden \u2013 that's the hashtag promoted by AOC and the socialists. The woke-topians will settle for Biden because they will make him an extra in a movie written, produced and directed by others,\" he said. \"It's a horror film really.\u00a0 They'll disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your home, and invite MS-13 to live next door.\u00a0 And the police aren't coming when you call in Democrat-run cities. They're already being defunded, disbanded.\" Ronna McDaniel, who helms the Republican National Committee, focused on differentiating the GOP from the Democrats, saying the latter are advocating for policies that \"would have been unthinkable a decade ago.\" The RNC chairwoman said that Democrats failed to describe their policy priorities during the DNC, and said the race in November between Mr. Trump and Biden pits a president who is tough on China and illegal immigration against a \"nice\" guy. She said the Democrats' \"argument for Joe Biden boiled down to the fact that they think he's a nice guy.\" McDaniel said that over the next few days, Americans will hear from hardworking, everyday Americans as evidence of how Mr. Trump has been fighting for all Americans across his first term in office. \"Tonight begins a new chapter in the Great American story \u2013 a story that has inspired the world for generations and when we reelect President Trump this November, the best is yet to come,\" she said. Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, also one of Mr. Trump's most vocal supporters on Capitol Hill, painted Mr. Trump not only as the president who has taken on the status quo, but also recounted a personal interaction Mr. Trump had with Jordan's family. \"I love the president's intensity and his willingness to fight every day in Washington for our families. But what I also appreciate about the president is something most Americans never see, how much he truly cares about people, \" Jordan said. Jordan recalled that two years ago, as his family mourned the loss of his nephew Eli in a car accident, he was speaking with Mr. Trump on the phone three days after his death as he was walking into Eli's parent's home. Jordan said he asked the president to speak with Eli's father, Todd, and Mr. Trump obliged. \"For the next five minutes, family and friends sat in complete silence, as the president of the United States took time to talk to a dad who was hurting,\" the Ohio Republican said. \"That's the president I've gotten to know over the last four year, a president who shares private moments like this with soldiers, victims of violent crime and people who've had businesses destroyed by the mob. That's the individual who's Made America Great Again and who knows America's best days are still in front of us.\" The St. Louis couple who wielded guns outside their mansion as Black Lives Matters protesters marched past, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, said they were appearing before voters to warn that protesters could descend upon their neighborhoods as well if Joe Biden is elected in November. \"Whether it's defunding the police, ending cash bail so criminals can be released back out on the streets the same day to riot again, or encouraging anarchy on our streets, it seems as if Democrats no longer view the government's job as protecting honest citizens from criminals, but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens,\" Mark McCloskey said. The McCloskeys have been\u00a0charged with unlawful use of a weapon over the incident. Patricia McCloskey claimed Democrats want to \"abolish the suburbs altogether\" and praised Mr. Trump for protecting suburban neighborhoods. \"Make no mistake: No matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats' America,\" she said. Patricia McCloskey said Mr. Trump must be reelected, because \"when we don't have basic safety and security in our communities, we will never be free to build a brighter future for ourselves, for our children, and for our country.\" Congressman Steve Scalise of Louisiana shared his behind-the-scenes experience with Mr. Trump. He recalled being visited by the president and first lady Melania Trump in the hospital after he was shot when a gunman opened fire on lawmakers during baseball practice in 2017. The president's actions as Scalise recovered are a side of him \"the media will never show you,\" he said. The Louisiana Republican said that in Mr. Trump's first term in office, he has shown \"visionary leadership,\" including during the coronavirus crisis as the Trump administration seeks to speed up development and distribution of a vaccine. \"America has been through tough times before,\" Scalise said. \"Who better to lead us out of these times than the president who already built the strongest economy our country has ever seen? Donald Trump did it before. Donald Trump will deliver for us again.\" As one of the few former members of the Trump administration speaking at the convention, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley recalled her experience representing the country in the body and praised Mr. Trump for his foreign policy record. \"The U.N. is not for the faint of heart. It's a place where dictators, murderers and thieves denounce America, and then put their hands out and demand that we pay their bills,\" Haley said. \"Well, President Trump put an end to all that. With his leadership, we did what Barack Obama and Joe Biden refused to do. We stood up for America and we stood against our enemies.\" Haley sought to contrast Mr. Trump with Biden, claiming that if the former vice president is elected in November, he would be doing the bidding of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senator Bernie Sanders and the progressive members o f\"the Squad.\" \"Their vision for America is socialism. And we know that socialism has failed everywhere,\" she said.Haley said that across his first term, Mr. Trump has demonstrated a \"record of strength and success\" and said he is tough on malign foreign actors, while claiming Biden would be a boon to adversaries. \"Joe Biden is good for Iran and ISIS, great for Communist China\u00a0 and he's a godsend to everyone who wants America to apologize, abstain, and abandon our values,\" she said. \"Donald Trump takes a different approach. He's tough on China, and he took on ISIS and won. And he tells the world what it needs to hear.\" Haley also forcefully rejected the claim that America is a racist country and recalled her own experiences growing up in the South as the daughter of Indian immigrants, saying she was a \"Brown girl in a Black and White world.\" \"America is a story that's a work in progress,\" she said. \"Now is the time to build on that progress, and make America even freer, fairer, and better for everyone. That's why it's tragic to see so much of the Democratic Party turn a blind eye toward riots and rage.\" Haley also recalled the unity in South Carolina, where she served as governor, following the mass shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston where nine worshipers were killed by a white supremacist. \"America isn't perfect. But the principles we hold dear are perfect,\" she said. \"If there's one thing I've learned, it's that even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America. It's time to keep that blessing alive for the next generation. This president, and this party, are committed to that noble task.\" As the first member of the Trump family to speak at the Republican National Convention, Donald Trump, Jr. praised his father for his response to the coronavirus epidemic and economic gains and said a Biden presidency would harm working Americans. \"Joe Biden is basically the Loch Ness Monster of the Swamp. For the past half-century, he's been lurking around in there. He sticks his head up every now and then to run for president, then he disappears and doesn't do much in between,\" Trump, Jr. said. \"So if you're looking for hope, look to the man who did what the failed Obama-Biden administration never could do and built the greatest economy our country has ever seen, and President Trump will do it again.\" Trump, Jr. said that under his father's administration, free speech has thrived, law enforcement is supported and all students will have access to a good education. \"America is the greatest country on Earth. But my father's entire worldview revolves around the idea that we can always do even better,\" he said. \"Imagine the life you want to have, one with a great job, a beautiful home, a perfect family. You can have it. Imagine the country you want to live in, one with true equal opportunity, where hard work pays off and justice is served with compassion and without partiality. You can have it.\" \"Imagine a world where the evils of communism and radical Islamic terrorism are not given a chance to spread, where heroes are celebrated and the good guys win. You can have it,\" Trump, Jr. continued. \"That is the life, that is the country, that is the world that Donald Trump and the Republican Party are after. And yes, you can have it.\" Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who closed out the first night of the Republican National Convention, said that while Mr. Trump and Biden are the two presidential candidates on the ballot in November, the election is \"about the promise of America.\" \"We live in a world that only wants you to believe in the bad news, racially, economically and culturally-polarizing news. The truth is, our nation's arc always bends back towards fairness. We are not fully where we want to be, but I thank God almighty we are not where we used to be,\" he said. \"We are always striving to be better. When we stumble, and we will, we pick ourselves back up and try again\". Scott praised Trump for the economic gains in his first term in office and for embracing Opportunity Zones, which stemmed from Scott's experiences working with his mentor, John Moniz, a Chick-Fil-a operator, and compared his record to Biden's record. \"I'm going to ask you, the American people, not to look simply at what the candidates say but to look back at what they've done,\" he said. \"This election is about your future, and it's critical to paint a full picture of the records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\" Scott recounted Biden's past comments on Black Americans and his efforts spearheading the 1994 crime bill. He also lauded the president's efforts on criminal justice reform and providing more funding for historically Black colleges and universities. \"When it comes to what Joe Biden says he'll do, look at his actions, look at his policies, look at what he already did and did not do while he's been in Washington for 47 years,\" Scott said.\u00a0 Scott closed by warning that if Biden and Harris are elected, \"they will turn our country into a socialist utopia.\" \"There are millions of families like mine across this nation, full of potential seeking to live the American Dream,\" he said. \"And I'm here tonight to tell you that supporting the Republican ticket gives you the best chance of making that dream a reality.\"",

Details surrounding the president's official acceptance speech on Thursday will be revealed in a forthcoming announcement. In an interview with a North Carolina NBC affiliate WCNC-TV, Pence said, \"I know the president and I are truly honored it'll be in Charlotte, it'll be here in North Carolina that we're re-nominated by the Republican Party.\u00a0 And I know the president \u2014 we're all making plans for him to accept that re-nomination here in Charlotte, to acknowledge the great work of our delegates.\" FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Joe Biden is staying briefed\u2014and mocking\u2014President Trump's recent tweets about pandemic and the election,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. \"President Trump should stop tweeting and start doing something about [the pandemic], damn it.\" But Biden also responded to one of those presidential tweets, saying Mr. Trump is \"trying to scare\" voters into supporting him by promising a \"Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood,\" he tweeted on Wednesday. The Twitter swipes came during a discussion with the Latino advocacy organization UnidosUS, during which Biden promised to send an immigration bill to Congress on the first day of his presidency and, if needed, offer greater COVID-19 testing from the federal government to undocumented persons. Biden's main focus was to embrace Latino voters: \"The future of America, and this is not exaggeration\u2026the future of America depends upon the total full, thorough integration and acceptance and embrace of the Latino community.\" PRESIDENT TRUMP \"I don't think Biden is going to do too well in Texas,\" President Trump said at an official White House stop in Midland, Texas. \"He's already written it off. He's gone. No fracking. That's part of his platform,\" Mr. Trump remarked at Double Eagle Energy oil rig, Wednesday, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0 The energy company received between $350,000 and $1 million in PPP loans from the CARES Act,\u00a0according to SBA data. But earlier this month, presumptive democratic nominee Joe Biden defended fracking in a television interview with a Pennsylvania affiliate, \"Well fracking is not going to be on the chopping block,\" Biden said. A Biden campaign official told\u00a0Erickson\u00a0on July 9, Mr. Biden's \"position on this has remained consistent which is no new fracking on federal lands. He has said that from the outset and that has been his position from day one of this race.\"\u00a0 More than 10,000 new coronavirus cases were reported in Texas, Tuesday. Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert tested positive for coronavirus, Wednesday. The Texas Republican has not been wearing a mask inside the U.S. Capitol and intended to fly to Texas with President Trump on Wednesday, but tested positive for the virus during a pre-screening at the White House, several administration sources confirmed to CBS News. Republican congressional candidate from Texas, Wesley Hunt, was on his way to greet President Trump in Midland when he, too, tested positive for coronavirus,\u00a0according to a statement on Twitter.\u00a0 According to our latest CBS News battleground tracker poll, Mr. Trump leads by a slight margin in Texas, 46% to Biden's 45%. But Biden leads among a key demographic in the lone star state \u2013 women likely voters, by 47% to 42%. \u00a0Trump Victory \u2013 a joint fundraising committee benefitting the Trump campaign, Republican National Committee and state parties\u2014raised $7 million in the run-up to a campaign fundraiser held in Midland, according to an RNC official. MIKE PENCE A private charter school with a history of anti-LGBTQ practices hosted Vice President Pence and Education Secretary Besty DeVos in North Carolina today. Pence visited a classroom of 4th graders and participated in a roundtable at Thales Academy to discuss reopening schools, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar.\u00a0 Thales, which is a year-round private school, allowed students to return two weeks ago. The school forbids students from discussing gender identities. Its\u00a02018-2019 handbook, says \"promotion, affirmation, or discussions of behaviors associated with terms, 'sexual orientation' or 'gender identity' including homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgenderism, are expressly prohibited.\" This applies to students, school employees and volunteers, and the only exception is made in cases of bullying. \u00a0Pence and DeVos also praised Thales' founder Bob Luddy with Pence saying Luddy has earned the administration's \"admiration\" for his work on expanding education opportunities. \u00a0 Pence reiterated the message that reopening America is tied to reopening American schools. \"We don't want our kids to fall behind academically or to miss other key services,\" Pence said. \"We believe that with the right measures in place, we can safely operate our schools,\" he added. According to pool reports, the classroom that Pence visited had 11 students present. A full classroom would usually have 25 students present, but parents were given the choice between in-person learning or continuing with a virtual model.\u00a0 VEEPSTAKES SUSAN RICE In an interview on The View, Susan Rice commented on speculation that she is under consideration to be presumptive nominee Joe Biden's running mate, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Rice said she only cares about Biden winning the presidency and noted that the vice presidential running mate position rests with Biden. \u00a0 \"I will leave that choice to him, but I'm ready to help him win and help him govern if that's what he wants,\" Rice said. Asked about how she would respond to Republicans potentially mentioning the 2012 Benghazi attack to criticize Rice if she is selected as Biden's running mate, Rice said that congressional committees investigated her role in the attack, and they found that she did not do anything wrong. But, Rice added that Republicans might still use Benghazi as a talking point if she is selected as Biden's running mate. \"I don't doubt that the Republicans will use this, and they'll attack whoever is Joe Biden's choice to be his vice president, but let's be honest about what this is,\" Rice said. \"This is dishonest, and it's a distraction.\"\u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN Senator Elizabeth Warren, who set up the Consumer Finance Protection (CFPB) bureau a decade ago, is calling on the agency's current director to resign, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. At a Senate Finance Committee hearing Wednesday, Warren argued that under Kraninger, the CFPB has failed to protect consumers, even as the pandemic has driven complaints up by 50%. She zeroed in on CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger's\u00a0guidance\u00a0for the agency not to take action against lenders so long as they make \"good faith\" efforts to resolve disputes.\u00a0 \"You're getting more and more complaints from desperate consumers, but instead of using the Bureau's full authorities to enforce the law, you just told companies you're going to help them when they cheat consumers ... Your leadership has been a miserable failure,\" she said. \"Based on your actions in this pandemic, you should resign.\" TAMMY BALDWIN Senator Tammy Baldwin reaffirmed her plans to physically attend the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, even as the party's national committee has scaled back in-person attendance to about 300 amid the continued spread of COVID-19,\u00a0Hudak\u00a0also\u00a0writes. \"I am planning on attending. ... I do believe that the DNC and the Biden campaign have put the health and safety of all participants front and center first and foremost in stark contrast to the campaign activities of President Trump,\" the Wisconsin senator said at a virtual event with the Milwaukee press Club Wednesday.\u00a0 She had\u00a0told\u00a0local TV station WKOW earlier this month that she hoped \"to be able to safely participate in some of the in-person events.\" During the event, Baldwin punted on questions about the potential that Biden will pick her as his running mate, but said she looks forward to his announcement. \"I'm looking forward to the announcement next week. I won't have to tiptoe around any more questions any more about what's happening,\" she said. \u00a0 CBS NEWS COVID CHRONICLES DETROIT'S WATER SHUTOFF HAS BEEN STOPPED FOR NOW, BUT NEED FOR PERMANENT FIX REMAINS CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of Americans in 2020 amid the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. \u00a0One of the key measures recommended to slow the spread of the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0is to wash your hands frequently, but that advice is impossible to follow for those without running water. In the months before the pandemic forced states to shut down,\u00a0thousands had their water shut off in Detroit, where shutoffs have been a point of contention for over a decade,\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell. For a variety of reasons \u2014 including fear of losing custody of their children and the shame associated with not being able to pay for water \u2014 many residents who have had their water shut off hesitate to share their stories. But advocates who work directly with affected families spoke with CBS News about how COVID-19 has exacerbated their need for running water. \"Water shutoffs have been devastating,\" said Dr. JoAnn Watson, a former Detroit city council member who has worked on this issue for years.\u00a0 \"How truly ironic it is for 1 out of every 7 households in the city of Detroit to have had their water shut off in a city surrounded by the Great Lakes of Michigan.\" From January to July 2019, there were more than 11,000 water shut-offs in Detroit according to data provided by the city's Water and Sewage Department.Though this total does not account for households that were restored through assistance programs, it's hard to tell how many of these households were occupied because that information is not tracked by the water department's billing system. In a city of more than 670,000 with an improving economy, by some accounts, one-third of the Motor City's majority-Black population lives in poverty. Wayne County\u2014home to Detroit\u2014comprises nearly a third of the entire COVID-19 caseload for the state of Michigan, which currently has over 78,000 confirmed cases.\u00a0 On March 9, Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggans launched a plan for the state to cover the cost to reconnect water service for Detroit residents at risk of a service interruption due to nonpayment. For $25 a month, residents can keep their water running throughout the duration of the pandemic. According to data from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, 1,200 households have applied for the restart program, but a quarter of those homes needed plumbing repairs before restoring water to avoid contamination and other health risks. DWSD believes that there are currently no occupied households without water but some water advocates are skeptical, asking if DWSD doesn't have records on the disconnected households, how can it be sure every resident has water?\u00a0 Read more\u00a0here. BY THE NUMBERS POLLS, POLLS, POLLS A new\u00a0Monmouth University poll\u00a0shows Joe Biden and Donald Trump in a dead heat in Georgia, reports\u00a0CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice.\u00a0 The poll of registered voters puts the president and former vice president each at 47% while another 3% each say they'll vote third party or are undecided. In 2016, Trump won Georgia with more than 50% to Clinton's just over 45%. Biden's advantages include the support of independents, where he leads Mr. Trump 53% to 31%, Black voters with whom he leads 89% to 5%, and among White college-educated voters where he leads Mr. Trump 59% to 36% in the state.\u00a0 Mr. Trump maintains his advantage among White voters overall, leading Biden 69% to 27%, and among White voters without a college degree 73% to 22%. In terms of favorability, 46% of voters in Georgia have a favorable opinion of Mr. Trump while 45% hold an unfavorable opinion; 41% view Biden favorably, while 46% viewed him as unfavorable.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he plans to release a new list of potential Supreme Court nominees after the justices rebuffed his administration's attempt to roll back the Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from the threat of deportation. Mr. Trump said in a pair of tweets the updated list will be revealed September 1, just two months before the 2020 presidential election. \"If given the opportunity, I will only choose from this list, as in the past, a conservative Supreme Court justice,\" he said. \"Based on decisions being rendered now, this list is more important than ever before (Second Amendment, Right to Life, Religious Liberty, etc.) \u2013 VOTE 2020!\" ...Based on decisions being rendered now, this list is more important than ever before (Second Amendment, Right to Life, Religous Liberty, etc.) \u2013 VOTE 2020! In teasing a new list of potential Supreme Court contenders, Mr. Trump appears to be following the playbook he used in the 2016 presidential election, during which he released an initial list of 11 candidates to fill Justice Antonin Scalia's seat following his death in February 2016. Mr. Trump's promise to choose Scalia's successor from that list helped drive enthusiasm from conservative voters, solidifying his presidential win over Hillary Clinton. The president's pick to replace Scalia, Justice Neil Gorsuch, was not on Mr. Trump's first list, though he was added in September 2016. His second Supreme Court nominee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was part of a later iteration released by the White House in November 2017. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were both judges on the federal appeals courts before they were elevated to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy following his retirement in 2018, and his appointment cemented the high court's 5-4 conservative majority. The president's promise of another Supreme Court list comes at the close of a tough week for his administration at the high court, with major rulings on cases involving abortion and subpoenas for his financial records still to come. Earlier Thursday, the court ruled 5-4 that Mr. Trump's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals was unlawful. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the liberal wing of the bench in ruling against the president. On Monday, the Supreme Court extended federal workplace protections to LGBTQ people with a 6-3 decision written by Gorsuch. The Trump administration had argued changes to the scope of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which was at the center of the legal battle, were best left to Congress. Also on Monday, the Supreme Court rejected a request from the Justice Department to take up its challenge to a California sanctuary law that restricts when state and local law enforcement can assist federal authorities with immigration enforcement activities, and turned away a slew of challenges to state laws that place restrictions on firearms. If Mr. Trump were to win a second term, it's unclear whether he would have the chance to fill another vacancy. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the anchor of the liberal wing, is 87 and has undergone four bouts with cancer, while Justice Stephen Breyer is 81. Still, Ginsburg has vowed to remain on the bench until she is at least 90. If either of them were to step down from the Supreme Court, leaving Mr. Trump to fill their seats, it would further solidify the court's conservative majority.",

            "article_content": "Vatican City\u00a0\u2014 Pope Francis called George Floyd by name, twice, and offered support to an American bishop who knelt in prayer during a Black Lives Matter protest. Cardinals black and white have spoken out about Floyd's death, and the Vatican's communications juggernaut has shifted into overdrive to draw attention to the cause he now represents. Under normal circumstances, Floyd's killing at the hands of a white police officer and the global protests denouncing racism and police brutality might have drawn a muted diplomatic response from the Holy See. But in a U.S. election year, the intensity and consistency of the Vatican's reaction suggests that, from the pope on down, it is seeking to encourage anti-racism protesters while making a clear statement about where American Catholics should stand ahead of President Donald Trump's bid for a second term in November. Francis \"wants to send a very clear message to these conservative Catholics here who are pro-Trumpers that, 'Listen, this is just as much of an issue as abortion is,'\" said Anthea Butler, a presidential visiting fellow at Yale Divinity School. Butler, who is African American, said the Vatican is telling Catholics \"to pay attention to the racism that is happening and the racism that is in your own church in America.\" The Vatican has long spoken out about racial injustice, and popes dating to Paul VI have voiced support for the civil rights movement and Martin Luther King Jr.'s message of nonviolent protest. History's first pope from the global south is no different. He quoted King at length during his historic speech to the U.S. Congress in 2015 and met with King's daughter, as his predecessor had done. But the degree to which Francis and the Vatican have seized on Floyd's killing is unusual and suggests a coordinated messaging strategy aimed at a national church that Francis has long criticized for its political and ideological partisanship, said Alberto Melloni, a church historian and secretary of the John XXIII Foundation for Religious Studies in Bologna, Italy. \"It's not like seven people had the same type of reaction\" by chance, Melloni said.  Last week, Francis denounced the \"sin of racism\" and twice identified Floyd as the victim of a \"tragic\" killing. In a message read in Italian and English during his general audience, Francis expressed concerns about violence during the protests, saying it was self-destructive. He also said, \"We cannot close our eyes to any form of racism or exclusion, while pretending to defend the sacredness of every human life.\" It was a clear effort to call out some conservative Catholics for whom the abortion issue is paramount, while other \"life\" issues dear to Francis \u2014 racism, immigration, the death penalty and poverty \u2014 play second fiddle at the ballot box. Francis has firmly upheld the church's opposition to abortion. And polls show a plurality of American Catholics support significant restrictions on legal abortion. But Francis has also lamented that the U.S. church is \"obsessed\" with abortion, contraception and gay marriage to the detriment of its other teachings. Mr. Trump is staking his outreach to Catholic voters largely on his anti-abortion platform. Francis spoke out June 3 after Mr. Trump posed in front of an Episcopal church near the White House, Bible in hand, after law enforcement aggressively forced protesters away from a nearby park.  A day later, Mr. Trump visited the St. John Paul II shrine, a visit denounced by the highest-ranking African American prelate in the U.S., Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Washington, D.C., whom Francis appointed to the politically important position last year. Gregory said he found it \"baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated.\" In that vein, the pope's phone call to Texas Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso last week appeared quietly significant. Seitz has taken a leading role in demanding fair treatment for migrants attempting to cross the southern U.S. border, a cause Francis has championed in ways that have fueled tensions with Mr. Trump. Francis called Seitz unexpectedly after he was photographed kneeling in prayer at a Black Lives Matter protest. Seitz said the pope thanked him without mentioning the demonstration, but the context was clear: \"My recent words and actions on the events that are taking place in the country now\" after Floyd's killing. Francis was not alone in making the Vatican's views known.  While the Holy See would be loath to be seen as picking sides prior to the U.S. election, its media operation has made clear its backing for peaceful protests, denouncing injustices suffered by black Americans and underlining its longtime support of King's message. Sunday's L'Osservatore Romano newspaper featured three Floyd-related stories on its front page. The first was that 1 million people were expected to protest that day in Washington. A second story was about a video showing two U.S. police officers shoving 75-year-old Martin Gugino, a white Catholic protester, to the ground in Buffalo. \"Go watch it, please,\" the article said. Its third story was about a prayer service presided over by the highest-ranking American at the Vatican, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who decried how America's constitutional ideals were failing its black citizens. In an interview, Farrell said he has spoken to Francis in the past about America's race problems, which he saw up close as an auxiliary bishop in Washington. Farrell said Francis is well versed in King and American history. Francis \"knows what the principle was and he knows what the struggle was,\" Farrell said. Natalia Imperatori-Lee, a professor of religious studies at Manhattan College, said the Vatican's message is having an effect on American Catholics. \"We are starting to see a kind of fissure emerge,\" she said. \"Whether that's going to be long lasting or whether it is a sign of a paradigm shift, I think it's too early to tell.\" A poll from the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute last week found that the share of white Catholics holding favorable views of Mr. Trump had dropped by double digits since last year, registering 37% in the last week of May compared with 49% across 2019.  The test, Imperatori-Lee said, will be if priests are still preaching about racism in six months. And beyond that: \"I guess we'll know if this works when Catholics go to the polls in November.\"",

Grenell, who has also served as acting U.S. Director of National Intelligence since February, implicitly confirmed his pending return to the U.S. in a series of tweets thanking people for their well wishes. The 53-year-old will formally resign his diplomatic post in the next few weeks, according to the German Press Agency.

Thank you, Congresswoman. https://t.co/nXerccf6Il In an interview aired Sunday by Sinclair Broadcast Group TV stations in the U.S., Mr. Trump praised Grenell for his work as acting intelligence director. That work included some contentious personnel changes that chaffed many in the American intelligence community, which Grenell had virtually no experience in before being tapped as acting DNI.  \"Richard Grenell is a superstar. He had guts, he had courage to do what he did. Richard Grenell has done one of the best jobs I've ever seen,\" said Mr. Trump. There's speculation that Grenell may now be asked to join Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, or possibly be tapped for some other senior role within the administration.  Mr. Trump surprised many when he called Grenell to Washington in February to temporarily take over as DNI, while continuing as the top American diplomat in Berlin. But now that job has been filled on a formal basis: Congressman John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican and another strong supporter of Mr. Trump, will be sworn into the role this week after a strictly partisan Senate confirmation process. The U.S. Embassy in Berlin has declined to comment on Grenell's future plans. While he remained on good terms with Health Minister Jens Spahn, Grenell made few other friends in Berlin. Among Germany's political establishment, the man from Michigan quickly gained a reputation as a relatively undiplomatic diplomat. There have been sporadic demands from Germany's opposition to declare him persona non grata in the country, and while Chancellor Angela Merkel's government always resisted, it voiced scant support for the ambassador.  Wolfgang Kubicki, Vice President of the German Parliament, at one point said Grenell was acting, \"as if the United States were still an occupying power here.\" After just one month on the job, Grenell shocked many in Germany, and beyond, by voicing support for Europe's right-wing political movements in an interview with Breitbart.  \"I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders,\" Grenell told the website previously run by\u00a0Steve Bannon. \"I think there is a groundswell of conservative policies that are taking hold because of the failed policies of the left.\" He presented himself as a \"big fan\" of Austria's then-chancellor Sebastian Kurz, a right-wing conservative who gained support with his calls for limits on immigration to Austria and Europe more broadly. In the world of international diplomacy, such public support for one political faction over another is something of a rarity.  Grenell dismissed accusations that he was interfering in Germany's internal affairs as \"absurd,\" but his overt pressure on Berlin on a number of contentious topics strained ties between the allies: His repeated, public forays into Germany's domestic affairs drew some unsolicited advice from a former German Ambassador to the U.S. \"Explain your own country's policies, and lobby the host country, but never tell the host country what to do, if you want to stay out of trouble,\" said Wolfgang Ischinger, a former ambassador who is now chairman of the Munich Security Conference. \"Germans are eager to listen, but they will resent instructions.\"  So what might Grenell's departure mean for transatlantic relations?\u00a0 You always wanted me to stop asking you publicly to pay your NATO obligations and calling for an end to Nord Stream 2. But these are US policies. And I work for the American people. https://t.co/AK240eMM3H Many in Berlin will breathe a sigh of relief. But there's now the possibility of another long period without a U.S. Ambassador in Berlin. It's unlikely the post will be filled before the U.S. presidential election in November, and even after that it could take some time.  Before Grenell was accredited in Berlin two years ago, the post went vacant for 15 months - the longest stretch since the end of World War II. You make a big mistake if you think the American pressure is off. You don\u2019t know Americans. https://t.co/QeplKk7lIt But as far as Grenell is concerned, one thing is clear: U.S. \"pressure\" on Germany isn't about to let up with his departure.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "It was precisely 100 years ago that, coming off the one-two punch of World War I and the Spanish flu, Warren Harding popularized a phrase and ran for president on the slogan \"Return to Normalcy.\" He won the election, but there was no normalcy. There was a roaring and rambunctious decade that ended with a Depression.\u00a0 The same principle applies today. We might speak, achingly, of our pre-COVID existences, but life has changed abruptly, profoundly and irretrievably. We will, instead, go hurtling into a new era.\u00a0 The real reckoning of our age, maybe of our lifetime, is not whether we will prevail over the virus. It's whether our respect for science, and our collective will\u2014so muscular during the crisis\u2014will prevail when we reboot and rebuild. Let's start with a thought exercise: It's New Year's Eve heading into 2020, a number, ironically, associated with perfect vision and clarity. What's your response that night upon being told that soon there will be no live sports or concerts or Broadway shows? That Grand Central Station at rush hour will look like this? That toilet paper might be more valuable than crude oil? That by spring, there will be food lines on the streets of New York and more than 300,000 people worldwide will have died tragically. Looking back, Mother Earth was starting to clear her throat and make herself heard: Australian bush fires were ravaging the continent. Earth had registered its highest temperatures since records began. Icebergs and glaciers melted, popsicles in the sun; there were floods and droughts; and swarms of locusts descending on Africa. Bill McKibben was one of the early climate change whistleblowers, so to speak. Ever since, he has been issuing warnings on the danger of ignoring science. Bill McKibben: One of the things that's so important here, I think, is that we're being reminded that physical reality is real.\u00a0 Jon Wertheim: What do you mean by that? Bill McKibben: We tend to forget that the physical world still is in charge. I've spent, you know, 30 years trying to get people to understand that physics and chemistry matter. That you can't spin them. They don't negotiate. They're not gonna compromise with you. You have to do what they say. Same goes for biology. On New Year's Eve, a Chinese government website made quiet reference to \"pneumonia of an unknown cause,\" clustered near a market in Wuhan. It was, of course, the Coronavirus. Bill McKibben: Biology just doesn't care. It doesn't care that it's causing a recession, you know? It's not going to back off because it's an election year. I mean, it just-- doesn't give a fig about any of that, you know? So you have to respect that, and that's hard for us because we're kind of used to a world where, you know, we run everything that there is to run. Yet by May, half the planet's population would be on lockdown\u2026 including Frank Snowden, a professor emeritus of history at Yale. Only months earlier, he'd published a book titled, \"Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present.\"\u00a0 Jon Wertheim: You've seen the movie before? Frank Snowden: I have seen parts of the movie; other parts have changed. The science is very different, but yes the plot is similar. This semester, while on a research trip in Rome, the professor came into contact with his subject matter, quite literally. He contracted COVID-19 and was quarantined. He couldn't help but notice that the methods used today to contain the virus were all too familiar. From the bubonic plague of the 1300s to the cholera pandemic of the 1800s. Frank Snowden: Our public health methods were built on the plague precedents. And so they had quarantine. They had social distancing. They had lockdowns. Doctors actually wore PPE. And what they had was a mask. We know about that. Theirs was differently shaped. It had a long beak. And they put sweet-smelling herbs in it, to keep the foul odors away. But in addition, they carried a long rod or verger and the doctor would physically keep people at a distance. He says there's comfort in history; we've been here before. And the real source of optimism might come from knowing that the aftermath of plagues has, consistently, brought about some of the great transformations, leaving societies looking radically different. Order comes from chaos. Jon Wertheim: You say it's not all doom and gloom. What are some other specific advancements that have come out of plagues? Frank Snowden: They introduced sewer systems, toilets. They set housing regulations, paved streets. So the hygiene of modern cities that we see today was built, in large part, on the sanitary measures that grew out of the terrible experience of Asiatic cholera.\u00a0 Jon Wertheim: You're talking about real enhancements that we've enjoyed for centuries that have sprung from plagues. Frank Snowden: Yes, that's absolutely correct. But before we advance, we must survive, what is being termed, \"the war,\" an analogy used to help us conceive of the inconceivable. Weapons, armor, provisions, casualties, emergency medics, valor on the front lines. But leave it to a novelist to pick apart flawed imagery. Arundhati Roy lives in Delhi, where she's written a defining account of the COVID crisis for the Financial Times.\u00a0 Jon Wertheim: You wrote that this virus has mocked immigration controls, biometrics, border surveillance. What did you mean by that? Arundhati Roy: Well, I just meant that, you know, the world has spent so much time guarding its borders against the outsider, or the enemy, you know? And somehow it has attacked the most powerful countries in the world, in-- in the most tragically powerful way. Jon Wertheim: No defense budget can-- can repel this? Arundhati Roy: No defense budget. They refer to it as a war. But if it were a war, then nobody would be better prepared than the United States, you know? If it-- if it were that you needed nuclear missiles or depleted uranium or bunker busters or tanks or submarines or whatever it is, there would be plenty. But there aren't swabs. There aren't gloves. There aren't masks. There isn't medicine. And these microbes are no conventional enemy. They outnumber us, they mutate, they travel undetected, indifferent to what country we come from, the size of our social media following, or our net worth. So it is that coronavirus has consigned athletes, the alphas of our society, to their basements and yards, freezing their careers. It has grounded concert tours, the air now wallpapered by different musical acts. Some less famous, all less mobile. Coronavirus has exposed fissures in our society. Cities, of course, are particularly hard-hit, their hum and thrum silenced, their beating hearts no longer pulsing with life. The poor are bearing the brunt, suffering and dying disproportionately. Social distancing, nevermind Zoom conferencing, is an impossible luxury to many. Different places experience this horror differently. Different ages, too. An entire generation of students sit in a kind of virtual detention, no fault of their own, unsure when and how they will graduate or restart school. Time and space have unraveled for us all. And Arundhati Roy has some analogies.\u00a0 Arundhati Roy: Right now it feels as though we have no present, you know? We have a past. And we have a future. And right now we're in some sort of transit lounge. And there isn't any connection between the past and the future. Arundhati Roy: We should not be trying to stitch them together without thinking about that rupture, you know? And that rupture is not just one of production and consumption and all our-- you know, it's-- I think the most profound thing is the rupture of the idea of touch, you know, the idea of proximity. All these things will become so laden with risk and fear for a long, long time. If microbes have the ability to create a rupture in the lives of billions, we humans have our own powers and evolutionary advantages. Our intelligence, empathy, and our ability to cooperate. It's hard to conceive of another time in human history when, worldwide, the best minds of our generation were all fixated on solving the same riddle, scribbling on the same blackboard, sharing data and sharing screens. And it is precisely this spirit that will determine how the aftermath of COVID-19 transforms us and shapes our future. Do we reimagine health care, now that we've seen how easily systems stress and lock out so many? And what about the gulfs between rich and poor? Maybe the biggest decision of all, now that the planet has essentially hissed, \"I will not be ignored,\" how do we confront the climate emergency? It's been the life-work of the environmentalist Bill McKibben, who is also a distinguished scholar at Middlebury College.\u00a0 Jon Wertheim: You see a real way to use this catastrophe as opportunity? Bill McKibben: Well, what choice does one have, really, in a-- in a crisis but to try and-- and make something useful of it? I mean, the dumbest thing to do would just be to set up all the pins in the bowling alley one more time exactly the same way. Here we are, where Robert Frost, you know, lived for the last 40 years of his life, in the woods of Vermont. Wrote many of his great poems. Maybe his most famous poem is about the two roads diverging in the wood, you know? Maybe it's sorta time to think about taking the slightly less travelled one. Jon Wertheim: What-- what does the less travelled road look like here? Bill McKibben: We've spent the last 7,500 years really fixated, in our country and increasingly around the world, on economic growth as the reason for all being. And, you know, for the most part, that's where there, at least for a while, that worked out pretty well. Lot of people were pulled outta poverty, whatever else. But we've begun to sense the limits of that too. That's why the temperature keeps rising, you know? Look no further than what's happened during this crisis. The shutdown to industry has offered a glimpse of what collective response can look like. Arundhati Roy's India is home to 17 of world's 25 most polluted cities; and not coincidentally the world's fastest growing major economy. Jon Wertheim: What is it normally like in Delhi? Arundhati Roy: Well, normally it is dystopian, you know? Especially in the winter months. Sometimes that smog is not just outside your house, it's inside your house, inside the rooms, you know? So that's how terrible Delhi is. And-- suddenly we're just seeing blue skies. And it's like this, from Shanghai to Secaucus, by circumstance and not design, a glimpse of life with fewer fossil fuels. And already the clean and quiet surroundings have found favor with wildlife.\u00a0 Jon Wertheim: What does that tell you about the Earth's ability to rebound and snap back? Bill McKibben: Well, maybe we still have a window to-- to take a step back. And if we do, maybe the Earth will meet us halfway. Jon Wertheim: And when people say, \"We need to get this economy restarted. We need to jump back on planes. This climate change, that can wait,\" what do ya say? Bill McKibben: Well, it obviously can't wait. You've gotta pay attention to reality or else ya end up getting bit by it, and bit pretty hard, okay? Jon Wertheim: You're sayin' flatten another curve? Bill McKibben: Flatten another curve. Flatten the carbon curve too. And-- and-- and if we did that, then people might look back in 50 years at this time and thank us, you know, instead of curse us.

            "article_content": "While Joe Biden's campaign staff in Philadelphia was ecstatic last night over its spate of primary wins, the candidate tried to portray a level of stoicism as the nation\u2014and his campaign\u2014is wrapped up in coronavirus health concerns. Unlike his opponent, Bernie Sanders, who hosted a round table on coronavirus this week, Biden has only made a few public statements about the outbreak, usually only responding if asked by journalists. That changes Thursday, when Biden will deliver remarks from his native Delaware on the health concerns, according to his campaign.\u00a0 On Wednesday afternoon, the former vice president announced the addition of a public health advisory committee to help provide guidance throughout the pandemic.\u00a0 A statement released to CBS News said, \"The campaign's top priority is and will continue to be the health and safety of the public. Members of the committee will provide ongoing counsel to the campaign, which will in turn continue to update the public regarding operational decisions.\" \u00a0 Biden also told MSNBC this week he is trying to limit handshaking, but it's a hard habit to break for the glad-handing Biden, especially as he bounded through a Detroit construction site this week greeting IBEW workers. For a primary filled with twists and turns, it's not surprising Biden's campaign schedule remains in flux. Several campaign aides tell\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0the campaign schedule is being taken day-by-day, state-by-state. They plan to heed the advice of state officials on whether to host the larger events. After consulting officials last night, the campaign canceled Biden's rally in Cleveland, as the former vice president was en route to the event. The campaign also preemptively canceled another rally in Tampa for later this week. We're told the campaign is considering ways to hold smaller local event in the next competing states. Biden said this week he wished President Trump would \"be quiet\" and \"let the experts speak\" on coronavirus. He is expected to expand on this theme and condemn the Trump administration's response to the virus, as emblematic of an administration that doesn't tell the truth or adhere to science. FROM THE CANDIDATES BERNIE SANDERS A defiant Bernie Sanders\u00a0said\u00a0today that he will stay in the Democratic primary, despite a wave of poor results, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. Sanders said that President Trump must be defeated, and his campaign is the one to do that.\u00a0 \"Last night wasn't good,\" he conceded. Sanders said that while he's losing delegates, his campaign is a champion of the progressive movement and young people. Sanders said that his policies are leading with Democratic voters. His obstacle, according to Sanders, is electability. He said his campaign talks to voters who say they love Sanders' policies but don't think he can win.\u00a0 While acknowledging this setback, Sanders challenged convention: \"Today, I say to Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters that represent the future of country.\"\u00a0 In a jab at opponent Joe Biden, Sanders said, \"We cannot be satisfied by just winning older votes.\" The Vermont senator said that he looks forward to debating Biden Sunday. Previewing that showdown, Sanders posed multiple questions to Biden on policies, including healthcare, climate, and immigration. \"Joe, what are you gonna do about ....\" he used in refrain. Sanders did not take any questions from reporters and left shortly afterward to tape \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" which will air Wednesday night. There are no other events currently on his schedule.\u00a0 STATE-BY-STATE MICHIGAN Former Vice President Joe Biden didn't just win Michigan's primary on Tuesday night, it appears the former VP swept all of the state's 83 counties says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. In 2016, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders only lost 10 counties to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Biden's 19 point margin of victory in Wayne County, the state's most populated county and home to Detroit, \u00a0was slightly less than Clinton's margin of victory there in 2016.\u00a0But the numbers in Detroit raise some questions about enthusiasm. In Detroit, Clinton 2016 got about 22,000 more votes in the 2016 primary than Biden did on Tuesday. Turnout also dropped slightly in the city. In 2016, 25.4% of registered Detroit voters cast a Democratic ballot, while 23.4% did so in 2020. But in the suburban counties, turnout was up for Democrats and Biden did well in key suburban Detroit counties. It should be noted, though, that Michigan runs an open primary, which allows people to vote for either party on election day, and there was not a competitive Republican race in 2020. \u00a037.3% more voters cast Democratic ballots in Macomb County, a swing county with many working class voters, in 2020 and 44.4% more voters cast Democratic ballots in Oakland County, another suburban county with some wealthier communities. A map published by the\u00a0Detroit Free Press\u00a0compares the results for each Michigan county in 2016 compared to 2020. Biden ran away with Macomb County, defeating Sanders by nearly 17 points in a county that Sanders lost to Clinton by just 1.4 points in 2016. Macomb County flipped from Obama to Trump in 2016 and has been emblematic of the voters Trump resonated with who may have historically been likely to vote Democratic. Biden beat Sanders by about 23 points in Oakland County, which Clinton won by about 5 points in the 2016 primary. And in Livingston County, a county that has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1964 and includes outer Detroit suburbs, Democratic votes were up 35.9% from the 2016 primary. Biden won this county by 17 points after Sanders won it by 21 points in 2016. Biden also managed to edge Sanders in the counties with large colleges, winning Washtenaw County where the University of Michigan is by 1.6 points, Ingham County which is home to Michigan State and Kalamazoo County which is home to Western Michigan. In Michigan's upper peninsula, home to many working class voters, Biden won two counties (Luce and Alger) by more than 20 points that Sanders won by more 20 points in 2016. The Detroit Free Press found that Biden beat Sanders 52%-38% outside of metro Detroit. In 2016, Sanders topped Hillary Clinton 56% to 42% outside of metro Detroit. \u00a0 LIFE AFTER 2020 MICHAEL BLOOMBERG A week after dropping out of the race, the presidential campaign for billionaire and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg\u00a0announced\u00a0that the campaign spent $275 million in anti- President Donald Trump advertising.\u00a0 Bloomberg made it no secret that defeating Donald Trump was a major goal of his candidacy for president and today his campaign, one that spent over $500 million since it began at the end of November, listed some of the staggering figures it spent. \u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0lists a few of those figures: according to the campaign, Bloomberg spent $175 million of his personal wealth for 31 different TV spots in local markets which included all battleground states. In addition the campaign spent $49.6 million in digital anti- Trump ads.\u00a0 The campaign says it received almost 3 trillion impressions on just YouTube and Facebook. By comparison, Advertising Analytics reports the campaign for President Trump and other groups that support him have spent more than $34 million in paid media nationally before Bloomberg entered the race. This includes $30 million in digital ad spending and $3.1 in television ads. Bloomberg's campaign also reported to spend $671,664 in what they call out-of-home advertising.\u00a0 This includes the billboards placed in the Las Vegas Strip and in Phoenix, first reported by CBS News, that the Bloomberg campaign put up to troll Mr. Trump in February during his trip out west. CONGRESIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE About a week and change after Super Tuesday, two notable Congressional district match-ups are finally set. In California's 25th District, previously represented by Katie Hill before her resignation, Democrat State Assemblywoman Christy Smith will face off with Veteran Mike Garcia. Former CA-25 Congressman Steve Knight was eyeing a return, but fell short about 10,000 votes and then endorsed Garcia this week.\u00a0 In California's 50th District, previously represented by Duncan Hill before his resignation, Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar and former Congressman Darrell Issa have moved on past the primary. Issa previously represented the neighboring 49th District, and beat out conservative talk show host Carl DeMaio by more than 5,000 votes. DeMaio conceded and endorsed Issa on Tuesday, and\u00a0also invited Campa-Najjar to his talk show\u00a0next week. Because both of these districts are special elections, these matchups will be for the May general special election, as well as the November general election. The 39th District rematch between Representative Gil Cisneros and Republican Young Kim is off to a contentious start reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. After House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was slammed by the Asian-American community over his remark that Covid-19 is the \"Chinese coronavirus,\" Kim\u00a0told Politico\u00a0that \"This is a serious issue and not a partisan issue. I'm focused on ensuring that we protect the well-being of all residents by promoting COVID-19 updates and information.. ensuring everyone has access to care.\" Since then, she and Cisneros have been trading Tweets over the comments and Covid-19.\u00a0 \"My opponent shouldn't brush racist, xenophobic & misinformed comments aside when lives are at stake,\" Cisneros\u00a0Tweeted. \"This just shows she's not willing to stand up for\u00a0#CA39, she's only willing to stand up for GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy & President Trump.\"\u00a0 Kim, an Asian American immigrant,\u00a0said\u00a0Cisneros' comments were \"ignorant, insensitive, and racist\" and that his remarks are \"a clear example that everything he does and says is politically motivated and not in the best interest of the people he serves.\" A\u00a0newly released Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll\u00a0in Iowa shows that Republicans have the edge in all four Congressional districts, though only in a generic sense. The poll surveyed 667 likely general election voters, and asked \"If the elections for the U.S. House of Representatives were being held today, which party's candidate would you vote for in your congressional district?\" The 4th Congressional District, currently represented by Republican Steve King, had the biggest gap with 51% in support of a Republican and 40% for the Democrat. The poll didn't mention the specific names, specifically not the names of freshmen Congresswomen Cindy Axne and Abby Finkenauer, who both hold competitive seats that top Republicans' target lists.",

            "article_content": "In addition to the presidential primaries Super Tuesday, 120 congressional districts will also be holding primaries on Super Tuesday, and about three-quarters of these are in the delegate-rich states of Texas and California. One race features a progressive upstart in Laredo, Texas, taking on her former boss, and another, in California, has a Republican primary that's turned hostile. Here's what's happening with those and other House races to watch on Tuesday.\u00a0 There's a lot of national attention on Texas' 28th District Democratic primary, where Jessica Cisneros is looking to replace incumbent Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar.\u00a0 Cuellar has held this seat for 15 years and has not had a competitive primary challenger until now. He's getting some high-profile help, though \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to the Laredo area for to support Cuellar at a campaign event last week.\u00a0 \"We want this to be not only a victory, but a resounding victory for Henry Cuellar,\" Pelosi said. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which protects incumbents, has also backed Cuellar. \"We support House Democrats, and Henry Cuellar is a House Democrat. It's not any different for Henry Cuellar than it is for anybody else,\" DCCC Chair Cheri Bustos told reporters in January.\u00a0 Cisneros aligns with a lot of progressive ideals, including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, and is painting Cuellar, who she once interned for, as out of touch with the district. Her closing argument centers around his votes on immigration and the border wall, and she derides him as \"Trump's favorite Democrat.\" She also points to his \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association, and the financial support he's received from the Americans for Prosperity Action, a super PAC funded by billionaire Charles Koch.\u00a0 \"He cares more about their money than our dreams,\" Cisneros says in an ad released last Thursday.\u00a0 Almost $5 million in total has been poured into this primary and the clear link with the presidential race begins with Cisneros. She has been endorsed by former presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. It's a lot of outside attention that strategists say hasn't been seen in this district much.\u00a0 And it is this outside attention that is putting a spotlight on the sway of the progressive movement powered by Sanders' 2016 presidential run, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upset of New York Congressman Joe Crowley in 2018 \u2014 though Cisneros' Texas district is far more moderate.\u00a0 Cuellar's campaign manager Colin Strother looks at the outside attention and talked about how Cisneros' socialist ideals (i.e. Medicare for All, the Green New Deal) and agenda represent an intra-party conflict. \"[Cuellar's] not out there trying to purify the party in his own vision. He's out there trying to expand the party. And he understands that that means it's a big tent. And what we have are a bunch of people including many of the people endorsing our opponent, who they're not Democrats. They're socialists,\" he said. \"They've never been involved in the party before, they see it as a vehicle to advance their agenda, and they've now parachuted in trying to tell people who's a good Democrat and who's not.\" In Dallas, the crowded Democratic race for the 24th District is looking at three main contenders. Jan McDowell is running for the third time in this district, after having her closest margin yet in 2018 with a 3-point loss to Republican Congressman Kenny Marchant, who announced his\u00a0retirement last summer.\u00a0 Kim Olson has been the fundraising leader in the pack with almost $1 million in total raised, and represents the more moderate Democrat option when it comes to gun control and climate. Trailing her in fundraising is Candace Valenzuela, a Carrollton-Farmers Branch school board member who has been endorsed by Senator Warren. In an interview in September, Olson said she's expecting to spend about $3 million throughout this race in order to win convincingly.\u00a0 \"You have to do the work because money begets money. And if you're not willing to do the work, if you aren't willing to get on the horn and call donors, if you're not willing to invest in your own team in order to drop funds into Texas, then you probably ought not to be in this kind of race,\" she said.\u00a0 Whoever comes out of this primary, which could extend into a May runoff, will likely face Republican front-runner Beth Van Duyne. Democrats have been pointing to this district as one they can flip, hoping the changing demographics will help them in this historically red suburban district. In another nearby district, Texas' 12th, a hardline Trump supporter is looking to get an establishment GOP Congresswoman out of office. Former City Council member Chris Putnam has attacked Representative Kay Granger for being a \"Never Trumper\" and her past pro-choice stance on abortion. Granger, who endorsed Jeb Bush in the 2016 presidential race, received the endorsement from Trump in December. Southeast of the 12th District is the 17th, where former Representative Pete Sessions is eyeing a return to Congress. Sessions previously represented the state's 32nd District before being beat by Democrat Colin Allred in 2018. The seat opened up after Republican Congressman Bill Flores announced last year that he would retire. Flores has backed business owner Renee Swann \u00a0 In Houston, Pierce Bush is looking to see if he can continue his family's political fortune in the race for Texas' 22nd District. To do that, he'll have to get past candidates like Greg Hill, Kathleen Wall and Troy Nehls, all unapologetic supporters of the president who have questioned Bush's commitment to Mr. Trump. Wall has raised and spent close to $3.2 million for this race, but Bush is a heavy Republican establishment favorite and was listed on the National Republican Congressional Committee's \"Young Guns\" list alongside Hill. After he received the endorsement of the district's Representative Pete Olson, another retirement heading of this election cycle, Hill immediately looked to tie Bush to the \"swamp.\" \"The D.C. establishment is trying to manipulate this race by throwing their full support behind a celebrity candidate who doesn't live in our district and who even marched in the streets of New York City in protest of President Trump,\" he said in January. \"I pledge to stand with President Trump to drain the swamp, not become part of the problem.\" The two most competitive primaries in California are also the state's impromptu special elections. \u00a0 In California's 25th District, formerly represented by Katie Hill, who\u00a0resigned\u00a0amid allegations of affairs with her staff, polls show that Democrat state assemblywoman Christy Smith is poised to box out progressive talk show host Cenk Uygur in the state's jungle primary, where the top two candidates move on to the general election regardless of party.\u00a0 The ideological contrasts in this Democratic race mirror those of the presidential primary race. Smith is pitching herself as a centrist moderate who can work across the aisle, while Uygur has fully taken the progressive lane, though not without some controversy. Uygur was briefly endorsed by Sanders, but he backtracked within 24 hours, after criticism over Uygur's past sexist comments. Those degrading remarks about women also led him to be ousted in 2017 from the progressive group Justice Democrats that he helped found.   Smith has racked up endorsements from California Democratic figures like Governor Gavin Newsom, Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris and Pelosi. But the two are pretty evenly matched in fundraising, with Smith bringing in $1.15 million and Uygur raising $1.04 million.\u00a0   On the Republican side, Steve Knight is running to reclaim his typically Republican Los Angeles county seat after being beat out by Hill in 2018. To do that, he'll have to get enough votes to get past veteran Mike Garcia. Garcia has received the endorsement of the state's Republican party, and leads all candidates in the field in fundraising.\u00a0 Down in San Diego, two Republicans have been engaged in a vicious primary for Representative Duncan Hunter's old seat. Hunter\u00a0officially resigned\u00a0in January, after pleading guilty to misuse of campaign finance funds.\u00a0 Darrell Issa, who previously represented the neighboring 49th District before deciding to leave Congress in 2018, is hoping to keep conservative talk show host Carl DeMaio off the final ballot. The race has taken a common dynamic of Republican House elections this cycle, as the two men look to \"out-Trump\" each other and show that their support of the president is stronger.\u00a0 Issa's campaign has been pointing to polls that show the gap between him and DeMaio growing, and said in a statement that voters have a clear choice between Issa and DeMaio, \"a Never-Trumper\" and a \"liberal who will undermine his agenda at every possible turn.\" DeMaio has been running ads attacking Issa for \"betraying\" Trump due to his previous comments about calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Russian involvement in 2016's elections. In an interview with CBS News, DeMaio said that while \"nobody likes negative ads,\" Issa's decision to leave in 2018 shows that he's not as much of a \"fighter.\" \"I am a fighter. I don't sell out. I don't back down from a tough fight. And I think the president needs more fighters on his side to advance the agenda that the American people support. Issa quit in 2018. Like a little schoolboy or girl, he went running from a fight when the President needed Republicans to run for re-election in 2018, many of them like Darrell Issa cut and run and gave up. And that's why I think it was easier for House Democrats to take the majority,\" he said.\u00a0 Whoever comes out of this will likely face Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, who narrowly lost to Hunter in 2018. Stephen Goggin, a political science lecturer at San Diego State University, said this district is historically Republican and that either Issa and DeMaio will likely win the seat in November.\u00a0 \"It's pretty overwhelmingly Republican, and I think these types of attacks probably resonate quite well with the base there. Even Hunter while he was under indictment, beat Campa-Najjar in 2018 by like four points. So, being the most Republican, being the most Trump is something pretty strategic for this district,\" he said.\u00a0 Both of these races are special elections with a special election runoff set in May. This also means that candidates will be on the ballot twice, one for the May runoff to finish out the current term and one for the November general election.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "To commemorate the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Nicholas Thomas and more than 100 other volunteers will board up vacant houses, install school safety signs and make other improvements to a Detroit neighborhood. Their mission is to celebrate King's legacy by being good neighbors and helping lift up a primarily black school in one of the poorer areas of the city. As Thomas fans out across the neighborhood with hammer and nails, King's legacy of peace and racial and social justice will be foremost in his mind. But at the same time, he's struggling to come to grips with the deep racial divisions roiling the nation under President Trump. \"Dr. King wanted unity. We have Trump separating immigrants ... the wall,\" said the 19-year-old Thomas who is black. As the nation marks the holiday honoring King, the mood surrounding it is overshadowed by deteriorating race relations in an election season that has seen one candidate of color after another quit the 2020 presidential race. Two black candidates \u2014 U.S. Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker \u2014 and the lone candidate of Hispanic ancestry, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, have dropped out of the Democratic race for the White House. \"That scares me a lot,\" said Deja Hood, 21, of Chicago, a senior at Eastern Michigan University. \"Who is going to really back our voicing? You can't understand a minority if you've never been in a minority situation. Even though you can advocate for us all day, you could never understand the issues we go through on a daily basis.\" Booker, Harris and Castro struggled with raising money and with polling. Asian American entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Samoan American, and black former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick remain in the race, but are not considered top contenders for the Democratic nomination. The front-runners in the field are all white men and women. \"It's disappointing, but really not surprising. You look at it and think, 'damn, now what?'\" said Xavier Cheatum, 22, an African American senior at Eastern Michigan who along with Hood is participating in King events on the school's Ypsilanti campus, west of Detroit. People have the right to be \u2014 and should be \u2014 concerned about the state of race relations and the way people of color, in particular, are being treated, said Jill Savitt, president of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta. \"What we're seeing right now, it's very public and people are showing their hatred openly, but it doesn't mean it wasn't there,\" Savitt said. \"There is a coming realization in our country. We have to come to a reckoning about our past and the truth about our history from slavery to the lynching era to Jim Crow. Only with real honesty about our situation can we come to some reconciliation and move on to fulfill King's hope and dream of a real, peaceful multicultural democracy.\" It doesn't help when elected leaders don't \u2014 or are slow to \u2014 stand against hate and intolerance, she added. Mr. Trump referred last year to a predominantly African American congressional district that includes\u00a0Baltimore\u00a0as a \"disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\" During a\u00a02018 immigration conversation\u00a0in the Oval Office, he disparaged Haiti and some African countries with coarse language. And following a 2017 clash between white nationalist demonstrators and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, Mr. Trump said there were \"very fine people on both sides\" and that there was \"\u00a0blame on both sides.\" One anti-racism activist was killed. In 2018, there were more than 7,000 single-bias incidents reported by law enforcement, according to\u00a0FBI hate crime\u00a0statistics. More than 53% of the offenders were white, while 24% were black. Nearly 60% of the incidents involved race, ethnicity and ancestry. \"Racism has long been a way for people to maintain their power,\" Savitt said. \"Manipulating people's fears and anxieties is the way you do that. The Trump administration has certainly fanned the flames.\" Mr. Trump is trying to court black voters, knowing that he isn't likely to win them over en masse but could chip into Democratic advantages if he wins more black support in critical swing states. His campaign has\u00a0stepped up outreach\u00a0efforts, including to African Americans and Latinos, marking a departure from 2016 when Mr. Trump's volunteer \"National Diversity Coalition\" struggled to make an impact. The campaign already has spent more than $1 million on black outreach, including radio, print and online advertising in dozens of markets since the coalition's launch, the campaign has said. Only 6% of African American voters went for Trump in the 2016 election, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. Mr. Trump's message to black voters in that campaign was: \"What have you got to lose?\" Supporters now say they have a record to point to, including the low black unemployment rate and investments in historically black colleges and universities. A Washington Post-Ipsos\u00a0poll\u00a0of African Americans in early January found that 90% disapprove of Mr. Trump's job performance and 83% say Trump is racist. Laying it all in Mr. Trump's lap is unfair, said Carol Swain, an advisory board member to the national Black Voices for Trump. \"With Trump, he has pushed the American nationalist identity that I think tamps down the kind of conflicts we would have,\" said Swain, who is black and has taught political science at Vanderbilt and Princeton universities. \"He has pushed patriotism over race and that benefits our country.\" Faith Morris, chief marketing and external affairs officer for the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, doesn't see it that way. \"It's definitely a white America. A black America. A Hispanic America,\" Morris said. \"And there's a very broken line that connects the different Americas. In 2020, we still feel the oppressive issues that Dr. King fought against. He focused on the same things we're focusing on now.\" Jacob Sklarsky recently read a book about King and the civil rights movement to students in his second-grade Chicago Public Schools class. \"To look at the faces of young black kids who are sometimes hearing about this history for the first time, they are distressed by it,\" said Sklarsky, who is white and a member of KAM Isaiah Israel, a Jewish congregation in Chicago. \"They were very relieved at the end because, in a way, it was all worth it,\" Sklarsky said. \"It gives us some hope, but it's also very sad that we're not anywhere near what King dreamed of.\"",

            "article_content": "With such an acrimonious election, we turn tonight to a man who tells the story of America in all her divisions and struggle for unity. Ken Burns' documentaries range from \"The Civil War\" to \"Baseball,\" Vietnam, and last year's, \"Country Music.\" Burns calls himself an emotional archeologist. He excavates lost love letters, forgotten photos and overlooked heroes. Research so deep, viewers can feel like strangers discovering America for the first time. His films ask what it means to be American. So, we asked, what does it mean to be Ken Burns? Ken Burns: I have had the privilege of spending my entire life making films about the U.S., capital U, capital S. But I've also had the privilege of making films about 'us,' the two-letter, lowercase, plural pronoun, that has a kind of intimacy and warmth to it.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: In the \"Country Music\" film, Merle Haggard says, country music is \"about those things we believe in but can't see, like dreams and songs\"-- Ken Burns: Songs and souls-- Scott Pelley: --\"and souls.\"\u00a0 Ken Burns: It's telling us that there is in front of us a kind of rational world, in which one and one always equals two, but that the thing that compels us forward as human beings, is that we look for one and one equaling three. We find that in our faith. We find that in our art. We find that in our love of each other. And I think one of the things I discovered working on \"Country Music\" is that when I understood this dynamic between the U.S. and us, lowercase, uppercase, that I realized there's only us, no them. \"Us,\" the American struggle to forge union from diversity, has been Ken Burns' obsession since he was 11 years old at the end of this lane in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1965, his mother was dying of cancer at the same time the fight for equality was in critical condition. Ken Burns: Before my mom died, I would watch, and I would hear from the other room about the dogs and the fire hoses in Selma. And it would make me as upset, as upset in my gut, as the worry about my mom. And it was almost as if I was transposing the cancer that was killing my family, and the cancer that was killing my country. And if you look at my films, almost 40 of them, you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of films that don't end up dealing with race.\u00a0 His early films included \"The Statue of Liberty\" and \"The Congress.\" But it wasn't until his seventh that America returned Ken Burns' affection.\u00a0 \"The Civil War\" was seen by 39 million viewers, an eleven-hour epic that immortalized a love letter and a waltz.\u00a0 Ken Burns: The Ashokan Farewell.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: The fiddle tune-- Ken Burns: The fiddle tune-- Scott Pelley: --that you can never get out of your head years later. Ken Burns: \"Na-da-di-da-da-da-dum.\"\u00a0 The lament seemed written as a score for the letter Union soldier Sullivan Ballou wrote his wife, a week before his death.\u00a0 \"The Civil War\" episode 1: I shall always be with you in the brightest day, and the darkest night always, always, And when the soft breeze fans your cheek it shall be my breath, or the cool air your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.\u00a0 Ken Burns: I think every man wishes he could say those words to the woman he loves, and every woman wishes that her man could say that.\u00a0 Burns' films are a letter to the country he loves but not out of blind devotion. His is the affection that endures after confronting America's founding flaw. \u00a0 Ken Burns narration in \"Thomas Jefferson\": We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, yet he owned more than 200 human beings and never sought fit to free them. Burn's finds the American paradox in the wars we fight and the games we play. Ken Burns: I told people that \"Baseball\" was the sequel to \"The Civil War,\" and I meant it. I meant it. How we play games, and the nature of immigration, and the exclusion of women, and popular culture, and advertising, and heroes, and villains, and our imagination, and race, and race, and race are who we are.\u00a0 Ken Burns: And the first real progress in civil rights after the Civil War takes place when Jack Roosevelt Robinson, the grandson of a slave, makes his way to first base at Ebbets Field on April 15th, 1947. Then there's no question that the story of baseball is just gonna take off from the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the failure of reconstruction and move, to that, to that moment. Ken Burns' moment came in 1981 with his first subject, the Brooklyn Bridge, which no one thought was a good idea.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: Well, you had an inanimate object and no one to interview. Ken Burns: Right. Scott Pelley: Great television. Ken Burns: Yes. And I look 12 years old. So, I was out tryin' to raise money and they'd say, \"This child is trying to sell me the Brooklyn Bridge. No!\"\u00a0 PBS bought \"The Brooklyn Bridge\" and Burns structured his style, animating images frozen in time and giving them voice. Famous voices volunteer just to be in a Ken Burns film. Meryl Streep as Eleanor Roosevelt. Tom Hanks in \"The War.\" His films have the pace of patient revelation. And time to think.\u00a0 It's the rhythm of a director who lives not in New York or Los Angeles, but on 50 acres of walpole, New Hampshire where even his apples have history. Ken Burns: So these are cuttings that were taken from trees at Monticello. Of course they are. We met Burns before the pandemic. At 67, he has four daughters from two marriages. But his longest relationship, four decades, is with PBS. Ken Burns: I'm fortunate that PBS exists. I can go tomorrow to a premium channel or some place, a streaming service, and get $30 million to do Vietnam. But no one's gonna say, \"You can take 10 and a half years, Ken.\" He can take his time because he raises the money and runs his own company, Florentine Films. Producers, writers, historians, editors and photographers craft a half-dozen films at once so Burns can release about one a year even though a series like \"Country Music\" takes eight years to finish. Scott Pelley: You listened to 15,000 songs, sifted through more than 100,000 still photos, and did 101 on-camera interviews. Why so much? Ken Burns: One would think that making a film is an additive process. You're building this. It's not. It's subtractive. The best metaphor I know of is we make maple syrup here in this town. And it takes 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup. And that's what the process is. Burns has boiled down the history of Mark Twain, the National Parks, plus, 18 hours on Vietnam and 19 hours of jazz. Wynton Marsalis: Ken's films touch something at the heart of our mythology, in who we have been at our best and at our worst, and who we want to be. Composer Wynton Marsalis collaborated on \"Jazz\" and \"Country Music.\" Marsalis is artistic director of New York's Jazz at Lincoln Center and something of an expert on improvising with Ken Burns.\u00a0 Wynton Marsalis: He'll be vibrating, and that'll be in the fourth year of something, and it'll be 1:00 in the morning after you've worked since 9:00 in the morning. So now it's 1:00, so-- and he's till like, \"No, no, right here. We need to-- right here, we need to,\" and to see like a person with that type of energy and just on fire like that-- as he's grown old it's got worse. Scott Pelley: The fire's gotten bigger. Wynton Marsalis: The fire, the fire, the fire-- just the enthusiasm, the fire, the passion. Scott Pelley: Ken told us that you 'see' him. So, what do you see? Wynton Marsalis: You know, for me, I always see like a kid. If you can retain that childish awe and wonderment and believe that you can change things, if you can maintain that, and that's what I see in him. Childish awe and wonderment that somehow survived his childhood. Scott Pelley: Would you say you had a happy childhood? Ken Burns: I don't think I had a childhood. I mean, I did, and I had happy moments. But my mother got cancer very early on. And that was the shadow cast across my brother and my childhood. We also had a father who was not mentally healthy. He was a functioning person, but he was an unhappy man, and-- Scott Pelley: Depression? Ken Burns: Depression, maybe bipolar, never accurately diagnosed. \t Burns was 39 when he realized he was trapped behind the wall he built to shield himself from his mother's death. The revelation came from his father-in-law. Ken Burns: And he said, \"I bet you blew out your candles as a child, as a boy, wishing she'd come back?\" And I said, \"Yeah, how'd you know?\" And he goes, \"Look what you do for a living, you wake the dead. You make Abraham Lincoln and Jackie Robinson come alive. Who do you think you really want to wake up?\" So, I called my brother, and we wept, and we said we have to find mommy. They had to find her because she'd been buried in an unmarked pauper's grave with 28 souls simply because Burns' father never retrieved her ashes from the funeral home. Like researching a story, Ken and his filmmaker brother, Ric, tracked their history to the mass grave where they placed a memorial to Lyla Burns. Ken Burns: The ability to say to the world, 'this is us,' wouldn't have been possible without the crucible of her sickness, her death. And even that long wilderness of not dealing with it and dealing with it I think has made me a better filmmaker. A filmmaker working through the chapters of a single subject because Burns found, as Walt Whitman wrote, \"These states are the amplest poem.\" Ken Burns: I'm working on seven films right now. I mean, we got Ernest Hemingway, we have Muhammad Ali, we have Benjamin Franklin, we have LBJ biographies. We're doing a history of the American Revolution and a biography of the buffalo. They are, together, the story of a people straining for union, a theme Ken Burns has explored from his very first film which was, after all, about a bridge connecting America to America. Ken Burns: This is what stories do. They do liberate us from the tyrannies of our limitations, and our past, and our foibles. And so this is what we human beings do to negotiate this all too short passage that we call life. And I'm so grateful that I live in the United States of America, I mean that. I mean that. And that I get to tell stories about us, the U.S. Produced by Kaylee Tully and Ruth Streeter. Broadcast associate, Annabelle Hanflig. Edited by Joe Schanzer. Correspondent, \"60 Minutes\"",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration has been ordered to continue its 2020 Census population count through October, abandoning plans to end the count ahead of schedule due to COVID-19. A federal judge in California ruled Thursday that the administration's plan would not remedy COVID-19 delays, and instead would result in an inaccurate count that could cause \"irreparable harm.\" The U.S. Census Bureau, which is overseen by Trump appointee Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, announced in an August 3 press release that it would be ending its count by September 30 \u2014 a month before it originally planned \u2014 in order to complete data analysis by the end of the year. The Bureau promised to \"improve the speed\" of its count \"without sacrificing completeness.\" \"We will end field data collection by September 30, 2020. Self-response options will also close on that date to permit the commencement of data processing,\" reads the press release. \"Under this plan, the Census Bureau intends to meet a similar level of household responses as collected in prior censuses, including outreach to hard-to-count communities.\" California District Judge Lucy Koh, however, wrote in a\u00a0preliminary injunction\u00a0Thursday that the Trump administration's \"stated reason for the August 3, 2020 Replan\" \u2014 to get the census count to the president by December 31 \u2014 is both \"impossible\" and would inflict unnecessary harm on the electorate.\u00a0 \"These statements show that the hardship imposed on Defendants from a stay \u2014 missing a statutory deadline they had expected to miss anyway \u2014 would be significantly less than the hardship on Plaintiffs, who will suffer irreparable harm from an inaccurate census count,\" she wrote.\u00a0 The lawsuit was filed by a coalition of plaintiffs that includes the cities of Los Angeles, Chicago, the Navajo Nation, Black Alliance for Just Immigration, the National Urban League, NAACP, and League of Women Voters.\u00a0 Koh further wrote that the bureaus's August 3 press release \"never explains why defendants are 'required by law' to follow a statutory deadline that would sacrifice\" the constitutional requirement to count every person. The Justice Department is expected to appeal Koh's decision. Critics of the shortened timeline also argued that the White House was motivated to end the count early so that President Trump would have access to census results before a potential transfer of power after the November 3 election.\u00a0 In reaction to Koh's decision, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer, part of the coalition of plaintiffs, said in a statement that \"the Court saw through the Trump Administration's efforts to camouflage its political interference in what is supposed to be the neutral, nonpartisan process of counting every person.\" \"Now, with little time to lose and so much at stake, I urge everyone to take the few moments necessary to be included in the Census,\" Feuer wrote, directing people to fill out the census online.\u00a0 The census is a constitutionally-mandated, once-a-decade count of every single person within the United States. The simple concept has immeasurable impact on our political landscape. Not only does the census determine how many votes each state gets in Congress, it also determines how trillions of federal dollars are divvied up over the next decade. In-person data collection, a hallmark of the Census, was forced to pause in March due to COVID-19. The temporary suspension prompted the Census Bureau to initially request an\u00a0extension\u00a0for the count. \"In order to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the 2020 Census, the Census Bureau is seeking statutory relief from Congress of 120 additional calendar days to deliver final apportionment counts,\" read an April\u00a0press release from the Bureau. President Trump supported the Bureau's request at a press conference later that same day. \"During this difficult time we're also working to ensure that the 2020 Census is completed safely and accuracy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We may be asking for an extension because obviously they can't be doing very much right now \u2014 they wouldn't even be allowed to do it \u2014 so the census, we're going to be asking for a delay, a major delay, I think how can you possibly be knocking on doors for a long period of time now?\" Then, despite Mr. Trump's public support for an extension in April, the bureau announced in August that it would instead be speeding up the count. A recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Department of Commerce's internal watchdog found that the decision was not made by officials within the bureau. Senior officials said they did not know who made the decision, however some \"speculated the decision came from the department, while others thought the decision likely came from the White House.\"\u00a0 The Trump administration has pushed for other controversial changes to the 2020 census.\u00a0 Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges in New York prohibited the president from moving forward with\u00a0plans\u00a0to exclude undocumented immigrants from the count. The judges said the proposal violates federal laws that govern the redrawing of congressional seats and the census count.\u00a0 Excluding undocumented immigrants could have potentially seismic political ramifications. According to\u00a0an estimate\u00a0by the Pew Research Center, if unauthorized immigrants aren't counted, California, Texas and Florida would get fewer seats than expected in the House of Representatives; while Alabama, Minnesota and Ohio, would keep seats they would otherwise have lost.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 President Trump weighed in Thursday on the false \"birther\" theory that Kamala Harris doesn't qualify to be vice president. His comments came after a legal adviser to Mr. Trump's reelection campaign amplified a false theory questioning her eligibility because of the immigration status of her parents when she was born.\u00a0 Harris was born in Oakland, California, on October 20, 1964. Constitutional scholars and Supreme Court precedent have long held that anyone born in the U.S. is an American citizen, which makes them eligible for the presidency. Whether her parents were naturalized citizens or not does not change her citizenship or affect her eligibility, a constitutional law expert told CBS News. In a press conference Thursday, President Trump waded into the issue when he was asked whether or not he thinks Harris \"meets the legal requirements to run as vice president.\" \"I heard it today that she doesn't meet the requirements,\" Mr. Trump said, adding he wasn't sure what the case was. He praised the law professor who proposed the theory, John Eastman, as a \"very highly qualified, very talented lawyer,\" but added, \"I have no idea if that's right.\"\u00a0 He went on, \"I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice president. But that's a very serious \u2014 you're saying that \u2014 they're saying she doesn't qualify because she wasn't born in this country?\"\u00a0 Corrected by the reporter, who said that was not the case, the president replied, \"I don't know about it. I just heard about it. I'll take a look.\" Earlier Thursday, Jenna Ellis, a Trump campaign adviser, reposted a tweet from Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, in which he asked whether Harris is \"ineligible to be Vice President under the U.S. Constitution's 'Citizenship Clause'\" and shared the op-ed Eastman published in Newsweek. Ellis told CBS News that whether Harris, a California senator, can be vice president is an \"open question, and one I think Harris should answer so the American people know for sure she is eligible.\" But Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of Berkeley Law School and a constitutional law expert, told CBS News in an email that the issue \"is a truly silly argument.\"\u00a0 \"Under section 1 of the 14th Amendment, anyone born in the United States is a United States citizen. The Supreme Court has held this since the 1890s. Kamala Harris was born in the United States,\" he said. The relevant portion of the 14th Amendment reads: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" \"Some conservatives, such as John Eastman, think that is wrong and being born in the country is not enough,\" Chemerinsky added. \"[They're] clearly wrong under the language of the 14th Amendment and under Supreme Court precedent.\" The controversial op-ed written by Eastman was published after Joe Biden\u00a0announced Harris as his running mate Tuesday. Eastman ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for California attorney general in 2010 and lost to Steve Cooley. In the general election, Cooley was defeated by Harris, a Democrat. Claims about Harris's eligibility also emerged when she launched her presidential bid in early 2019, but were dismissed.\u00a0 In his opinion piece, Eastman said there are \"some\" questioning whether Harris can be vice president, because neither of her parents were naturalized U.S. citizens when she was born. \"That, according to these commentators, makes her not a 'natural born citizen' \u2014 and therefore ineligible for the office of the president and, hence, ineligible for the office of the vice president,\" Eastman wrote, without naming the \"commentators.\" Eastman went on to write that before voters \"so cavalierly accept Senator Harris' eligibility\" to serve as vice president, questions should be posed \"about the status of her parents at the time of her birth.\" Harris's mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a breast-cancer scientist who emigrated from India; her father, Donald Harris, was a professor from Jamaica. Harris is the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to be selected as a major party's vice presidential candidate. The theory put forth by Eastman and shared by Ellis is reminiscent of Mr. Trump's own yearslong promotion of the so-called birther conspiracy, in which he falsely claimed President Barack Obama wasn't born in the U.S. Mr. Trump first suggested in 2011 that Mr. Obama, the first Black president, didn't have a birth certificate, and it wasn't until 2016 that he backed away\u00a0from the disproven claim, saying \"President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period.\" Nicole Sganga contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday that authorities have found four cases of the coronavirus in one Auckland household from an unknown source. They mark the first reported cases of local transmission in the country in 102 days. Ardern said Auckland, the nation's largest city, will be moved to Alert Level 3\u00a0from midday Wednesday through midnight Friday, meaning that people will be asked to stay at home, while bars and many other businesses will be closed. \"These three days will give us time to assess the situation, gather information, make sure we have widespread contact tracing so we can find out more about how this case arose and make decisions about how to respond to it once we have further information,\" Ardern said at a hastily called news conference late Tuesday. \"I know that this information will be very difficult to receive,\" Ardern said. \"We had all hoped not to find ourselves in this position again. But we had also prepared for it. And as a team, we have also been here before.\" She said that traveling into Auckland will be banned unless people live there and are traveling home. She said the rest of the country will be raised to Level 2 through Friday, meaning that mass gatherings will be limited to 100 attendees and people would need to socially distance themselves from each other. Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the infections were confirmed after a person in their 50s went to their doctor on Monday with symptoms and was swabbed twice, testing positive both times. Six other people in the person's household were then tested, with three more positive results. \"Importantly, the person has no history of overseas travel,\" Bloomfield said, adding that the source of the infections remains unknown. Before the new cases were reported, Bloomfield had warned the country to not become complacent amid the pandemic.\u00a0 \u00a0\"We have seen overseas how quickly the virus can re-emerge and spread in places where it was previously under control, and we need to be prepared to quickly stamp out any future cases in New Zealand,\" Bloomfield said. Until Tuesday, the only known cases of the virus in New Zealand were 22 travelers who had recently returned from abroad and were being held in quarantine at the border. The country has been praised globally for its virus response. New Zealand initially got rid of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease. That stopped its spread. The New Zealand border is closed to nearly all travelers, with some exceptions,\u00a0according to the country's immigration site. Life had returned to normal for many people in the South Pacific nation of 5 million, as they attended rugby games at packed stadiums and sat down in bars and restaurants without fear of getting infected. But some had warned that the country had become complacent. New Zealanders have never routinely worn masks, but authorities have been urging people to buy them just in case. The outbreak comes less than six weeks before New Zealanders are due to go to the polls in a general election. Danielle Garrand contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "At an Arizona mask production site in May, President Trump thanked factory workers, GOP elected officials, and the owners of Sammy's Mexican Grill. \"I think most of us, all of us, all the Latinos are going to vote for you,\" Jorge Rivas told the president.\u00a0 Now Rivas is lending his voice to Trump campaign ads that have blanketed the state, arguing in Spanish that the president's Democratic rival \"doesn't have the energy or capability to be the great leader this country needs.\" The spot is among more than $400,000 in ads that have aired on Spanish-language TV channels in Arizona in recent weeks, according to Kantar CMAG ad tracking data, outpacing spending in battleground states like Florida, which has nearly three times the number of Spanish speakers.\u00a0 Though Arizona awarded its 11 electoral votes to Donald Trump in 2016, Biden has tied or topped the president in nearly every recent poll here. If the former vice president were to win the Grand Canyon state, he'd be the first Democrat in three decades to do so.\u00a0 Much of Biden's lead comes from Hispanic voters, who comprise a third of Arizona residents. Sixty-nine percent support him in the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll. In 2016, 61% of Hispanic voters cast ballots for Hillary Clinton here. \u00a0 \"In 2016, we left too many young Latino votes on the table. In 2018, a lot of us put local investment here to turning out younger Latino voters and they did,\" said Congressman Ruben Gallego. Exit polls reported Hispanic or Latino voters cast 19% of all Arizona ballots cast in 2018, up from 15% in 2016.\u00a0 The Phoenix-area Democrat serves on the Biden campaign's \"Latino leadership committee\" of surrogates attending virtual Zoom events and fundraisers. \"The fact that they are investing this much time and money and effort in Arizona this early is impressive,\" Gallego added.\u00a0 Biden's campaign has also tapped a handful of Hispanic staff members, including state director Jessica Mej\u00eda to lead its Arizona operation, which is expected to grow to 200 paid staff by August. But Republicans insist they see an opportunity to erode Biden's edge among Hispanics. \"Something that Trump Victory takes a lot of pride in is finding and hiring folks from these communities to lead. And we have folks who are bilingual in Yuma, in Phoenix, in Tucson that are able to speak to these communities,\" said Drew Sexton, the Trump campaign's Arizona director.\u00a0 The campaign says it has \"over a dozen\" Spanish-speaking organizers, as part of a team numbering \"more than 80\" paid staff on the ground.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's supporters claim they've made historic inroads back into a Latino community once monopolized by skeptics of the president in Arizona. And Mr. Trump had a slight edge among Hispanic voters over\u00a02012\u00a0GOP nominee Mitt Romney, winning 28% of the Hispanic vote nationwide, compared to Romney's 27%.\u00a0 Sergio Arellano led Arizona's GOP Hispanic outreach in 2016. \"Until I came on board, it was nonexistent,\" he said. \"We didn't have coalitions. Basically, every variant of a Latino group is out for themselves.\" \"Today is the culmination of a lot of people you can talk to now, as compared to back then, because we are empowered. The coalitions are crazy,\" he added. Republican organizers have resumed some in-person campaigning and events in Arizona, while Biden's campaign continues to rely on phone contacts, social media, and virtual events to reach Latino voters amid the coronavirus pandemic. Top organizers and strategists in Arizona acknowledge remote organizing has proven an imperfect substitute for in-person campaigning, especially in Hispanic communities that often struggle with poor internet access and other obstacles to civic engagement. \"If you're on the lower end of voter participation and engagement, it's that much harder to reach people there,\" says Tania Unzueta, political director of Mijente, one of several groups trying to turn out Hispanic voters in Arizona and other battleground states against Mr. Trump.\u00a0 \"It just feels like the conversations need to happen in person. It hasn't been easy,\" Unzueta said.\u00a0Also based in Phoenix, Mi Familia Vota, has committed $10 million to a \"Basta Trump\" effort. \"We are doing conversations with potential voters that are low-propensity, that wouldn't traditionally go out to vote if we don't remind them and invite them to participate,\" says Mi Familia Vota's Arizona director Eduardo Sainz. For more than a decade, the group has led campaigns to sign up Hispanic voters in the state to vote-by-mail and has ramped up its efforts this year, partnering with local Spanish-language media. The latest CBS News polling in Arizona shows that among those not supporting Mr. Trump, 22% of Hispanic voters might be persuaded to switch their vote. Only three-fourths said they \"definitely\" planned to cast a ballot at all, behind 88% of White voters and 84% overall. Some Biden critics blame the controversial legacy of the Obama administration's deportation policies for a lack of support for the former vice president. Others argue the pandemic drowned out enthusiasm around pledges he made as the primaries drew to a close, like focusing deportations only on undocumented immigrants convicted of felonies. But Gallego says voters don't agree.\u00a0 \"They remember the times fairly fondly with Obama and Biden,\" he said. \"And their distrust of Trump is extremely deep here in Arizona.\" Republican hardline immigration policies on the state and federal have divided voters in the southwestern state, from controversial efforts in Arizona to curb illegal immigration to months of protest over wall construction along the state's border with Mexico. In his June visit to the state, the president visited the border barrier to sign a plaque marking its 200th mile of new construction, though he has tacitly admitted that much of it replaces existing fencing. \u00a0 Recent Spanish-language ads shared by Biden's campaign make only a few references to immigration, focusing their messages on economic issues and the coronavirus. All of the groups reached for this story agreed healthcare and pocketbook concerns now dominate their conversations with Hispanic voters in Arizona.\u00a0 \"Immigration is not a top three issue in any of our polling or our focus groups among Latino voters. Big emphasis on voters, not community,\" said Chuck Rocha, head of Nuestro PAC and author of a forthcoming book \"T\u00edo Bernie\" on the Sanders campaign's Latino outreach. Nuestro PAC has spent heavily on targeting Spanish-language media supporting Biden. However, Mr. Trump so far has outpaced Biden in ad spending targeting Hispanic voters, according to data collected by Kantar CMAG ad tracking. In Arizona, the Trump campaign's past buys on Spanish-language television channels is more than double that of the Biden campaign. CBS News reporter covering public health and the pandemic.",

The executive orders the president signed will require discounts on insulin and EpiPens that were given to some hospitals to be passed on to patients; and speed up a proposal to import prescription drugs from Canada and other countries for pharmacies, wholesalers and states. The president said the changes should eliminate the \"middlemen\" in drug purchases. \"The middlemen are making a fortune,\" Mr. Trump said, joking he probably sees some of them in Palm Beach, Florida. \u00a0 Mr. Trump said drug company executives will be at the White House on Tuesday and if they don't agree on a solution, an executive order will go into effect to make sure Medicare plans pay the lowest price on the international pharmaceutical market. Americans pay more for prescription drugs each year than people in any other developed country in the world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\u00a0 As the coronavirus crisis rages on just a few months before Election Day, the president has honed in on health care, which continues to be an important issue for voters. Among likely voters, a CBS News poll earlier this month found 71% said health care is a \"major\" factor in their vote for president.\u00a0 In a Fox News interview last week, Mr. Trump claimed he would be signing a health care plan in about two weeks, without any substantiating information. Any health care overhaul would have to be passed by a divided Congress.\u00a0 \"We're signing a healthcare plan within two weeks, a full and complete health care plan,\" the president told Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"We're going to sign an immigration plan, a health care plan, and various other plans.

            "article_content": "Tokyo\u00a0\u2014 A society that prizes harmony, Japanese are known for going to great lengths to avoid saying \"no.\" But last month Tokyo did just that, stunning Washington as it pulled the plug on a big-ticket U.S weapons purchase, the Aegis Ashore missile defense system. More than two years into the project, Defense Minister Taro Kono suddenly informed Prime Minister Abe, \"I don't want to go ahead with this,\" according to a report in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.\u00a0 Using advanced radar and SM3 interceptor missiles, Aegis Ashore was meant to complement the Japan's seven Aegis destroyers and Patriot PAC-3 surface-to-air missile systems.\u00a0 The country's decision to purchase the Aegis Ashore systems dates back to 2017, a year that saw 15 North Korean ballistic missile tests \u2014 some over Japanese airspace \u2014 as President Donald Trump accused allies including Japan of \"free-riding\" and threatened to withdraw U.S. troops. (Japan says it pays 74% of the costs to base 50,000 U.S. troops in the country.)\u00a0  To placate the White House, conservative leader Shinzo Abe announced a record $50 billion defense budget for 2019, including a shopping spree that called for fighter jets, destroyer upgrades and the two Aegis Ashore systems. Total price tag for Aegis Ashore alone, including maintenance and training: $4 billion plus.\u00a0 The systems were to be installed in Akita Prefecture, in northern Japan, and Yamaguchi, to the southwest, but almost immediately the project sparked blowback from local communities. Ministry of Defense planners lost credibility when it was revealed the sites were selected using the Google Earth app, based on error-ridden calculations, and that they hadn't actually visited the candidate locations. Most egregious, as far as local communities were concerned, was the lack of any guarantee that rocket boosters from the SM3 missiles would fall into designated drop areas and not land on residential neighborhoods, absent a fix that would take years to create at much higher cost. Even Prime Minister Abe's home prefecture of Yamaguchi, where the second system was to be installed, balked. \"We promised the local community we will control where the booster goes down, and we found out we were not able to do that. So we couldn't move ahead with this Aegis Ashore project,\" Kono explained to the Foreign Correspondents Club of Tokyo on June 25.\u00a0 To some American ears, the rationale seemed thin.  \"A chance of booster damage outside an SDF (Self-Defense Forces) base is still a lot better than a North Korean missile striking a Japanese city,\" argued James Schoff, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, to the Kyodo News service. \"So why can't the Japan side accept a little of that risk?\" But other analysts say the two-and-a-half-year rollout had become irretrievably tainted.\u00a0 \"The entire process was really, really badly handled,\" Brad Glosserman, a visiting professor at Tokyo's Tama University, told CBS News. \"It was the botched surveys\u2026 the way the Defense Ministry handled outreach to local communities, the usual NIMBYism.\"  Glosserman argues that Tokyo \"lowballed\" the project's cost to win public support, then drew wrath when the program appeared to incur cost overruns. Still, a more conventional member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party might have pushed through the impasse. The current defense minister is no ordinary politician. Taro Kono, 56, is that rarest of Japanese lawmakers; as outspoken and confident in international settings as he is on the floor of the Japanese parliament. Educated at Georgetown University, he is known for taking progressive stands, including opposing nuclear power and easing Japan's restrictive immigration policy. Within the party and government he has been dubbed a maverick \u2014 not necessarily a compliment in a consensus-driven society. Speaking to CBS News, Stephen Nagy, a professor of international relations at Japan's International Christian University, recalls an episode several years ago, when Kono was serving as foreign minister. It was a post his own father, Yohei, had held back in the 1990s. \"Wang Yi, the foreign minister of China, told him he was nothing like his father\u2026 \u00a0alluding to the fact that his father was much more friendly to China,\" Nagy said. Without missing a beat, Kono countered: \"You're not the China my father was dealing with!\" So far, there has been a conspicuous lack of reaction from the White House \u2014 not even a single angry tweet. Some analysts speculate that timing figured into Tokyo's decision to scrap the Aegis Ashore purchase. Absent a once-in-a-century pandemic and Mr. Trump's sliding popularity ahead of the November election, \"we might not have been able to do this,\" political scientist Narushige Michishita told CBS News. \"We would have been much more concerned about the possible negative response from the U.S. and Mr. Trump.\" Michishita, of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, believes losing Aegis Ashore will clear the way for an option long-cherished by Japanese conservatives \u2014 acquiring a preemptive strike capability, making better use of the 147 F-35 fighters it has on order.\u00a0 Japan traditionally has interpreted its post-WWII \"peace constitution,\" which bans the use of force, as forbidding any preemptive attack. \"It's like being a boxer who doesn't punch!\" said Michishita. But the Liberal Democratic Party has debated the use of preemptive strikes for more than a decade, and with increased regional instability, once-implacable resistance within Japan to the idea of striking enemy bases is starting to waver. A strike option, Glosserman said, \"is something that some of the defense hawks have wanted for a while.\" The scrapping of Aegis Ashore \"really reanimates that debate.\"\u00a0 Japan's National Security Council is weighing missile defense options now, and could propose a strike capability as a cheaper, more flexible and effective\u00a0\u2014 as well as constitutional, provided enemy attack is imminent \u2014 alternative to Aegis Ashore.  If the hawks prevail, it would validate a view held by the party since 1956, when then-Prime Minister Hatoyama remarked: \"I have trouble believing that the constitution means for us to sit and wait to be destroyed.\"",

            "article_content": "Facebook says it will flag all \"newsworthy\" posts from politicians  that break its rules, including those from President Donald Trump, and will ban false claims meant to discourage voting, the company said Friday. CEO  Mark Zuckerberg had previously refused to take action against Trump  posts suggesting that mail-in ballots will lead to voter fraud. Twitter,  by contrast, slapped a \"get the facts\" label on them.  \"We will soon start labeling some of the content we leave up because it  is deemed newsworthy, so people can know when this is the case,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a\u00a0post\u00a0on Friday explaining the policy change. \"We'll  allow people to share this content to condemn it, just like we do with  other problematic content, because this is an important part of how we  discuss what's acceptable in our society \u2014 but we'll add a prompt to  tell people that the content they're sharing may violate our policies,\"\u00a0 Zuckerberg also shared specific examples of voter-suppression content that would get taken down, including posts suggesting that Immigration and Customs Enforcement will be checking papers at polling sites.\u00a0 Threats of \"coordinated interference,\" such as a post saying \"My friends and I will be doing our own monitoring of the polls to make sure only the right people vote,\" will also be removed, Zuckerberg said. Facebook announced the new policy after a dozen heavyweight advertisers said they were pulling ads from the platform in response to its divisive and sometimes hate-promoting content.\u00a0 On Thursday, Verizon joined several mid-sized companies in the Facebook boycott organized by prominent civil right groups. Then came Unilever: The Anglo-Dutch consumer-goods giant that owns brands including Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Lipton tea, became the latest company to pull its ads on Friday.\u00a0 Unilever said the  polarized atmosphere in the United States ahead of November's  presidential election placed responsibility on brands to act, and said it would stop advertising on Facebook and its Instagram subsidiary Instagram as well as Twitter at least until the end of the year. Shares of both Facebook and Twitter fell roughly 7% following Unilever's announcement. Sarah Personette, vice president of global client solutions at  Twitter, said the company's \"mission is to serve the public conversation  and ensure Twitter is a place where people can make human connections,  seek and receive authentic and credible information, and express  themselves freely and safely.\" She added that Twitter is \"respectful of our partners' decisions and  will continue to work and communicate closely with them during this  time.\" CBS News' Irina Ivanova contributed reporting.",

            "article_content": "The overnight purge of top news organization officials at the\u00a0US Agency for Global Media\u00a0(USAGM) has raised concern among its federal government employees and reporters that their jobs, immigration status, and editorial independence may soon be at risk following the arrival of new CEO Michael Pack.\u00a0 Pack, who is a conservative filmmaker and close ally of one-time Trump adviser Steve Bannon, and had just stepped into the job after being confirmed by the Republican-led Senate earlier this month, did not respond to a request by CBS News for comment or explanation. \"Pack uses deep state language. Is Bannon calling the shots?\" A USAGM source said this is the question being pondered by executives and journalists inside the organization now. Four news division heads were removed from their positions, including Middle East Broadcasting Network chief Alberto Fernandez, who is a former US Ambassador, Radio Free Asia's Bay Fang, Emilio Vazquez of the office of Cuba Broadcasting, and Radio Liberty's Jamie Fly. Replacements have yet to be named. Steve Capus, the former CBS and NBC News executive who had been serving as a senior advisor, was also dismissed. Earlier this week, the top director and deputy director at Voice of America resigned as did the head of the Open Technology Fund Libby Liu, which promotes global internet freedoms. \"These people are doing extraordinary things to push back against China and Russia,\" the USAGM source said, emphasizing that the work these journalists do is to counter disinformation from authoritarian regimes. Yet it appears that Pack was willing to stomach any congressional outcry related to the firings even just five months out from the US presidential election. The overnight firings has added to uncertainty among the staff of the networks who had already been shaken by the resignations of the Voice of America director Amanda Bennett, and deputy director Sandra Sugawara. President Trump recently accused the VOA of broadcasting Chinese propaganda, and accusation that many found Orwellian given the historic role of the agency in presenting a counter narrative to \u00a0communism during the Cold War. The USAGM is an independent federal agency, and under its umbrella is the Voice of America and other networks which broadcast what is described on its website as \"unbiased news and information in countries where the press is restricted.\" It was formerly known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors. According to the agency's website, there is a firewall meant to prevent interference by U.S. government officials in the reporting of the news by USAGM networks, and the reforms made by the 2017 National Defense Authorization are meant to maintain 'the longstanding statutory firewall language protecting the professional independence'. \"What I see from colleagues is concern. There is big concern,\" a Voice of America journalist told CBS News, adding that in particular there is fear that independent journalism will be replaced with propaganda. \"We have a firewall in place, and I hope it remains. But yes, the arrival of this man is concerning.\" Another source familiar with what happened told CBS News that Wednesday's purge was demoralizing considering that the agency networks' focus is to tell the stories that aren't being told by authoritarian regimes.\u00a0 A co-worker of the now dismissed head of Radio Liberty, Jamie Fly, described how dedicated the executive had been in defending his reporters who often faced intimidation and threats while reporting on Russia. Fly had recently relocated his young family to Prague. The recent pioneering reporting of Radio Free Asia has revealed details of China's mass internment camps of more than a million Muslim minorities, mostly Uyghurs, in Xinjiang province. Yet its head, Bay Fang, was unceremoniously removed from her position on the same day President Trump signed the Uyghur human rights bill into law. CBS News obtained an email from Fang to her staff at RFA following news of her dismissal, in which she obliquely mentioned \"structural changes\" as the reason for the transition out of her role. She also urged staff to remain focused on the mission of bringing unbiased news and information otherwise unavailable to their audiences in China, North Korea, Vietnam, Burma, Laos and Cambodia, and described that mission as \"even more important at this time.\" Ambassador Alberto Fernandez had recently launched an investigative team at the Middle East network, and had been praised for work on corruption in Iraq. Yet Fernandez was alerted via email of his firing. In tweets posted Wednesday night, he said: \"Wish the incoming people at\u00a0@USAGMgov\u00a0well. I hope they know what they are doing.\" He declined further comment. A coworker familiar with Fernandez's work described the long-time diplomat as a republican with rock solid credentials. In fact, Fernandez had been harshly critical of the Obama administration, as\u00a0a CBS exclusive interview\u00a0with him had indicated in 2015.\u00a0 Yet, he was still pushed out by Pack who was described to CBS as enigmatic, and distrustful of the agency.\u00a0 This same coworker said that before Pack arrived at the office Wednesday, he had security go through the trash and sweep for listening devices. Another USAGM employee told CBS News that there is fear that the new management may also choose not to renew visas for some of the journalists who work to create the non-English language broadcasts, which could mean that journalists would have to leave the U.S. \"The CEO signs off on the visas. This is my fear. We also have a backlog of J-1 visas that Mr. Pack has to sign that he has not signed yet.\" Two more sources familiar with the internal workings of USAGM said that there had been little or no communication between the network heads or leadership prior to Pack's dismissal of them. Their outreach to Pack and his team had been largely ignored, including inquiries on operational details such as how to handle new COVID19-related procedures to reopen the buildings for employees.\u00a0 When Pack reached out to the directors on Wednesday, essentially his first day on the job, he provided no reason for the firings. One source said that notices were sent out Wednesday evening informing the heads of the agency's networks that the board had been dissolved and replaced by an assortment of appointees from various agencies without including anyone with news experience or time at the State Department.\u00a0 According to a copy of one of these notices obtained by CBS News, the new board members include senior counsel of Liberty Counsel Action Jonathan Alexandre, a senior advisor to the U.S. Department of Housing Secretary, a communications director from the Office of Management and Budget, a USAID deputy, and the agency's Chief-of-Staff Emily Newman.\u00a0 Senator Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, blasted the firing of the news chiefs, saying in a statement on Wednesday: \"This latest attack is sadly the latest \u2013 but not the last \u2013 in the Trump Administration's efforts to transform U.S. institutions rooted in the principles of democracy into tools for the President's own personal agenda\". The U.S. government funded democracy watchdog organization Freedom House on Thursday called the removals \"deeply concerning\", and said \"The U.S. should be an exemplar, not a detractor of press freedom.\" Emily Tillett contributed reporting Margaret Brennan is moderator of CBS News' \"Face The Nation\" and CBS News' senior foreign affairs correspondent based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Voters in 14 states are weighing in on the Democratic primary race on Tuesday, March 3, commonly known as \"Super Tuesday.\" Early results showed Joe Biden was having a big night, winning Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee as the first polls closed. Bernie Sanders has won Vermont, his home state, so far this evening. American Samoa also held its caucuses (Bloomberg won his first delegates here). More than 1,300 delegates are up for grabs \u2014 over 30% of all the pledged delegates available \u2014 making it one of the most important days of the primary season. Only 155 delegates are awarded in the first four voting contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\u00a0 There are five Democratic candidates left in the race:\u00a0Bernie Sanders,\u00a0Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren,\u00a0Mike Bloomberg\u00a0and Tulsi Gabbard.\u00a0Sanders is the front-runner\u00a0in the race so far, having\u00a0won the popular vote in Iowa\u00a0and then decisive victories in\u00a0New Hampshire\u00a0and\u00a0Nevada. But\u00a0Biden pulled out a big victory in South Carolina, winning nearly 50% of the vote, and on the eve of Super Tuesday, he received the endorsement of three former opponents, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke, in a show of unity for moderates. The delegate count going into Super Tuesday showed Sanders with 60 delegates, Biden with 54 delegates and Warren with 8 delegates.\u00a0Pete Buttigieg\u00a0had 26 delegates before dropping out Sunday, and\u00a0Amy Klobuchar, who dropped out Monday, had 7. Polls began closing at 7 p.m. and will continue until 11 p.m. ET, when polls close in California.\u00a0 CBSNews.com will be posting\u00a0LIVE UPDATES\u00a0with the latest reporting on Super Tuesday throughout the night\u00a0HERE. *CBSNews.com writers Grace Segers,\u00a0Kathryn Watson,\u00a0Caroline Linton,\u00a0Stefan Becket\u00a0&\u00a0Melissa Quinn\u00a0contributed to this report\u00a0 FROM THE CANDIDATES ELIZABETH WARREN Elizabeth Warren usually pushes back on the idea of political lanes, but with a narrowing field on the eve of Super Tuesday,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says\u00a0she was making the case that she's the compromise candidate in the Democratic Party. \"We find ourselves barreling toward another primary along the same lanes as 2016: one for an insider, one for an outsider,\" she said Monday night in Monterey Park, California. \"Democratic voters should have more choice than that.\" The Massachusetts senator made a reference to the endorsements Biden received Tuesday, though she didn't identify the former opponents who announced their support of him earlier that evening, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke.\u00a0 \"No matter how many Washington insiders tell you to support him, nominating their fellow Washington insider will not meet this moment,\" she argued. \"Nominating a man who says we do not need any fundamental change in this country will not meet this moment.\"\u00a0 In an interview with CNN's Don Lemon Monday, Warren said of her former opponents' endorsement of Biden, \"I think that they see the world in many ways the same way that the vice president does. So I understand that. I think it makes some sense.\" Noting that \"the field has now narrowed sharply,\" with the moderates aligned on one side, Warren argued that their policies are not the ones the country wants. \"I think that what we've seen so far is that the Democratic Party is a progressive party,\" she told Lemon. \"Progressive ideas are popular.\" Bernie Sanders, who is the front-runner, has been the standard bearer for progressive policies like Medicare for All and free college. Without naming him, Warren raised doubts about his ability to enact these initiatives and sought to argue that she can, that she is the clear candidate for Americans who want a progressive agenda that can actually be enacted. \"We need someone who's going to get those progressive ideas done,\" she said. \"And that's the reason I'm in this race.\" She also criticized Sanders for his approach to paying for Medicare for All, estimated to cost around $30 trillion. \"Bernie thinks that we should raise taxes on middle-class families to pay for health care. And I've shown that we don't actually have to do that,\" she said. \"I think a much better way to do it is to raise taxes on the top one percent, to make giant corporations, like Amazon and Eli Lilly, that report billions of dollars in profits and pay nothing in taxes.\"\u00a0 During the Monterey Park rally, Warren again raised questions about how effective Bernie Sanders would be as president, though she did not name him. \"It's not enough to have big ideas. It takes a plan to turn those ideas into reality,\" she said. \"We need a nominee who has unshakeable values and who has a real track record for winning hard fights,\" Warren said of her candidacy. Sanders' supporters often accuse Warren of not having \"unshakable values.\" Just after Warren appeared on stage, three topless animal rights protesters stormed the stage and were escorted away by police. \"I love Los Angeles,\" Warren said, before launching into a speech about the power of protest. MONEY MATTERS ON THE $$$ A record amount of money is being spent on TV, radio and digital ads heading into Super Tuesday, according to\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. Just hours before some of the first polls closed in the 14 states holding contests, spending hit nearly $260 million by the candidates still in the race. Of that money, Bloomberg had contributed more than 90% with nearly $237 million spent in Super Tuesday states. Bernie Sanders spent just $18.4 million, while Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden spent just over $2 million apiece. Warren however, had the help of the Persist PAC which spent more than $11 million to her benefit in Super Tuesday states. Biden also has Super PAC help but it only contributed about half a million dollars for ads in the 14 states. \u00a0Since Saturday night, three democratic presidential candidates exited the race, but not before spending as well in Super Tuesday states. Tom Steyer spent nearly $45 million, Pete Buttigieg spent nearly $2.5 million and Amy Klobuchar spent $4.8 million on ads in Super Tuesday states before calling it quits. Buttigieg and Klobuchar have each since endorsed Joe Biden for president.\u00a0 CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE The Texas 28th Democratic primary result could give a lot of clues about the strength of the progressive movement in Texas, no matter who wins says\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. The challenger, Jessica Cisneros, headed into Tuesday with a fresh endorsement from EMILY's list and over $2 million raised. She is the bonafide progressive candidate, with endorsements from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. She's trying to defeat blue dog Democrat Representative Henry Cuellar, a 15-year incumbent. And while she's drawn comparisons to Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 upset of Congressman Joe Crowley, this southwest Texas district is not too similar to the Bronx or Queens that Ocasio-Cortez represents. But Cisneros has tapped into issues, such as immigration and getting money out of politics, that have become prevalent in her district.\u00a0 \"If enough women and young voters are activated, Cisneros will have the advantage,\" a memo sent out by her campaign states. \"We expect a strong showing in the Rio Grande Valley to be critical to Cisneros' success tonight. If we win Laredo outright, it's going to be an early night.\" Another Texas representative being challenged, Kay Granger, recently got another\u00a0Twitter endorsement\u00a0from the president. But she's facing big money from the side of her opponent, Christ Putman. \u00a0According to the\u00a0Dallas Morning News, $1.1 million has been spent by the Protect Freedom PAC in advertising against Granger.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court declined Monday to take up a legal battle over the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks, leaving the prohibition on the devices in place. Brought by a group of bump-stock owners and gun rights groups, the dispute not only took aim at the ban put in place by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in the wake of a deadly 2017 shooting in Las Vegas, but also raised the question of whether the Supreme Court should overrule a decades-old legal doctrine that is a target of conservatives. Known as the Chevron deference, named for the 1984 case Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, the doctrine requires federal courts to defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute passed by Congress. Conservatives believe the doctrine gives too much power to agency bureaucrats, and members of the high court's conservative wing, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, are skeptical of Chevron. Because the Supreme Court now has a 5-4 conservative majority, some fear the high court is eager to chip away at Chevron or overturn it completely and warn that could lead to a weakening of environmental, workplace and immigration regulations. President Trump directed then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft a rule banning bump stocks in February 2018 after a gunman opened fire on concert-goers in Las Vegas, killing 58 and wounding 500. Law enforcement discovered the shooter outfitted several firearms with the devices, which allow semi-automatic rifles to fire more rapidly. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced in December 2018 it would be expanding the definition of \"machine gun\" under the National Firearms Act to include bump stocks. The ban officially took effect in March, leaving any person with the device subject to a felony. Bump stock owners and gun rights groups challenged the ban in federal court, but have suffered a string of losses. Lower courts declined the block the Trump administration's ban from taking effect, and in March, the Supreme Court rejected attempts to halt its enforcement. In a statement accompanying the Supreme Court's decision not to hear a challenge to the bump stock ban, Gorsuch said he agreed the case does not merit review, but criticized the lower court for applying\u00a0Chevron\u00a0when it upheld the ban. \"The agency used to tell everyone that bump stocks don't qualify as 'machine guns,'\" he wrote. \"Now it says the opposite. The law hasn't changed, only an agency's interpretation of it. And these days it sometimes seems agencies change their statutory interpretations almost as often as elections change administrations.\" He wondered why the courts should defer \"to such bureaucratic pirouetting.\" Chevron,\u00a0he added, \"has no role to play when liberty is at stake,\" citing the criminal penalty associated with owning a bump stock. In their filing with the Supreme Court, lawyers for the bump-stock owners and gun groups argued that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit \"applied Chevron deference in a manner that stretches that doctrine beyond its breaking point.\" But the Justice Department defended its process for expanding the definition of \"machine gun\" and argued the case is a \"particularly unsuitable vehicle\" for addressing questions of agency deference. \"The government has urged throughout this litigation that the agency's application of the statutory definition of machine gun to the bump stocks at issue is the best interpretation of the statute \u2014 wholly apart from any question of deference,\" Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court urging the justices not to hear the dispute. Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the Las Vegas shooting happened in 2017, not 2018.",

From the earliest minutes of the debate at the Paris Theater in Las Vegas, the Democratic presidential hopefuls took aim at Michael Bloomberg, whose appearance Wednesday marked his first on the debate stage. The Democrats \u2014 Joe Biden, Pete Buttiegieg, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 seized on Bloomberg's billionaire status, his past support for controversial policies like stop-and-frisk and accusations of sexist and degrading comments.\u00a0 But it wasn't just Bloomberg who was on the receiving end of Democrats' jabs. There was plenty of time for them turn on one another, too. Here are the top moments from the most ferocious 2020 debate so far: Less than 10 minutes into the debate, Warren made clear her disdain for Bloomberg, warning that Democrats are taking a \"huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\" \"I'd like to talk about who we're running against,\" Warren said. \"A billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians.' And no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\" Democrats, she continued, will not defeat President Trump in November \"if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop-and-frisk.\" Klobuchar continued with the attack on Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, saying that Democrats need a candidate who presents a stark contrast to Mr. Trump. \"I don't think you look at Donald Trump and say we need someone richer in the White House,\" she said.Buttigieg, meanwhile, sought to tie Bloomberg and Sanders together, saying the Democratic Party needs to nominate a candidate \"who is actually a Democrat.\" One, he said, \"wants to burn this party down,\" and \"the other wants to buy this party out.\"  Bloomberg was a Republican but switched his voter registration to Democrat before his mayoral run, while Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist. The former New York City mayor attempted to differentiate himself from Mr. Trump, saying that as a New Yorker, he knows how to take on an \"arrogant con man\" like the president. 2. Bloomberg pressed on unwillingness to release women from confidentiality agreements But it wasn't just the size of Bloomberg's bank account that earned the ire of his Democratic opponents. His fellow candidates also hounded the businessman and former mayor on his decision to not release women from nondisclosure agreements they signed regarding allegations of workplace misconduct. \"I hope you heard what his defense was: 'I've been nice to some women,'\" Warren said in response to Bloomberg. \"That just doesn't cut it. The mayor has to stand on his record.\" The Massachusetts senator pressed Bloomberg on how many women signed confidentiality agreements and said a lack of transparency about his conduct damages his electability, particularly if there is a \"drip drip drip\" of damaging stories about him that could come to light in the run-up to the general election. Biden echoed Warren, saying Bloomberg's unwillingness to release women from nondisclosure agreements is an issue of transparency. \"None of them accuse me of doing anything,\" Bloomberg protested, adding, \"Other than maybe they didn't like a joke I told.\" The multi-billionaire refused to agree to let women speak freely about their experiences working for his company. \"They signed the agreements and that's what we're going to live with,\" Bloomberg said. But he also said, \"I have no tolerance for the kind of behavior that the Me Too movement has exposed,\" and he pointed to women who worked with him in New York's City Hall and the high marks his company, Bloomberg LP, receives from employees.\u00a0 \"We're not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually,\" he said. 3. Warren defends Klobuchar from attacks by Buttigieg In a rare break from the infighting among candidates, Warren came to Klobuchar's defense as she fended off attacks from Buttigieg for forgetting the name of Mexico's president and his policies in a recent televised interview. Buttigieg accused Klobuchar of lacking the knowledge to serve as president, saying she is staking her candidacy on her experience and \"literally part of the committee that's overseeing these things.\" Klobuchar, he said, was not \"able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south.\" \"Are you trying to say that I'm dumb?\" Klobuchar responded. \"Or are you mocking me here, Pete? I said I made an error. People sometimes forget names.\" Warren jumped in to defend Klobuchar in a brief moment of unity, saying the attacks on her are \"not right.\" \"I understand she forgot a name. It happens to everybody on the stage,\" Warren said. \"Look, you want to ask about whether or not you understand trade policy with Mexico? Have at it. If you get it wrong, you ought to be held accountable. You want to ask about autonomy, you ought to be held accountable. You want to ask about a thousand different issues and you get it wrong, you ought to be held accountable. Let's be clear. Missing a name all by itself does not indicate that you do not understand what is going on.\" 4. Septuagenarians with stents are pressed on their health While Sanders and Bloomberg are very different candidates, they have a few things in common: they're both 78 years old and they both have stents. Moderator Hallie Jackson asked Sanders about his claims of transparency, after he has not yet released his medical records after suffering a heart attack last year, despite an earlier saying that he would. His campaign did not immediately disclose the heart attack he suffered in October, and he has since declined to release his medical records. He has released letters from doctors. \"I think the one area maybe that Mayor Bloomberg and I shared, you have two stents as well,\" Sanders said, addressing Bloomberg. He also said that he had cardiologists following him on the campaign trail. \"They follow me around the campaign, three, four, five events a day; see how you're doing compared to me,\" Sanders said. 5. \"Mayor Bloomberg, should you exist?\" Bloomberg's wealth was a frequent topic of discussion among Democratic candidates in Nevada, but it was a September tweet from Sanders that kicked off a discussion about the distribution of wealth in the country. When asked to elaborate on what he meant when he tweeted \"billionaires should not exist,\" Sanders said there is a \"grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth and income.\" \"Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans,\" he said. \"That's wrong. That's immoral.\" Moderator Chuck Todd then turned the question on Bloomberg, asking \"Mayor Bloomberg, should you exist?\" \"I can't speak for all billionaires. All I know is I've been very lucky, made a lot of money and I'm giving it all away to make this country better,\" the former New York City mayor said. \"And a good chunk of it goes to the Democratic Party as well.\" Asked whether he should have earned so much money, Bloomberg said yes, as he worked hard for it. 6. Tensions between Buttigieg and Klobuchar boil over The battle between Buttigieg and Klobuchar reached a fever pitch Wednesday as the two traded barbs over whether they each have the experience to lead the country. In addition to knocking the Minnesota senator for forgetting the name of Mexico's president, Buttigieg also criticized Klobuchar on her record on immigration, for voting to confirm a Trump-nominated head of Customs and Border Protection, as well as the president's judicial nominees.\u00a0 As he began to speak in Spanish, Klobuchar mocked, \"I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete.\" The Minnesota senator said she has been \"in the arena,\" unlike the former South Bend mayor, and she countered that the unnamed CBP nominee, Kevin McAleenan, had been recommended by Obama administration officials. \"You've memorized a bunch of talking points and a bunch of things,\" Klobuchar said. In response, Buttigieg accused Klobuchar of suggesting his experience as a mayor didn't measure up. \"I'm used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important than mayors,\" he said. \"You don't have to be in Washington to matter.\" 7. Warren on opponents' health care plans: \"a PowerPoint,\" a \"Post-It note,\" and \"Yeah, probably won't happen anyway\" Warren, who has proposed a plan to transition to \"Medicare for All,\" dispensed with the health care proposals offered by several of her opponents in quick succession: Mayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their health care.\u00a0 It's not a plan.\u00a0 It's a PowerPoint.\u00a0 And Amy's plan is even less.\u00a0 It's like a Post-It note, \"Insert Plan Here.\"\u00a0 Bernie has started very much \u2014 has a good start, but instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead, his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work.\u00a0 And then his own advisers say, yeah, probably won't happen anyway.\u00a0 Buttigieg joked that he was \"more of a Microsoft Word guy,\" while Klobuchar noted that Post-It notes were invented in her home state of Minnesota. Klobuchar also touted her support for implementing a public option, saying that most Democrats in the Senate did not support the Medicare-for-All bill proposed by Sanders and supported by Warren. Biden made the argument that he was the only one on stage who had actually accomplished health care reform, since he had worked on negotiations with lawmakers on the Affordable Care Act when he was vice president. 8. Protesters interrupt final minutes of debate As the Nevada debate came to a conclusion with candidates making their closing statements, there was one last moment of drama as protesters in the Paris Theater interrupted Biden's final remarks. \"You deported 3 million people,\" the demonstrators shouted. Biden paused his remarks as the protesters were escorted from the room. Grace Segers contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Senator Amy Klobuchar that aired Sunday, February 16, 2020, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. She joins us this morning from Las Vegas. Senator, good to have you.\u00a0 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Great to be on, MARGARET. Thanks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you take Attorney General Barr at his word that he would not take legal measures for political purposes and that his personal intervention in the Roger Stone case had nothing to do with the president's directive? SEN. KLOBUCHAR: You know, I think he needs to go under oath, and I'm very glad that he's going to have to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. I also hope he comes over to our Senate Judiciary Committee as well, because that's where we're really going to be able to get that answer. The president is constantly tweeting out different requests of the Justice Department. And I think here where you've got career prosecutors that made difficult decisions about how to handle this case, they got a conviction, they put their all into it, and then they get undermined on the sentencing. And they- one of them leaves the Justice Department, the other one gets transferred off the case. That is not normal at all. You have to allow justice to have its course, and that means no political intervention. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We'll see if that hearing happens, Senator. But I want to get to your candidacy now. You are a 2020 contender. You did well in New Hampshire. Nevada's a very different state. It is more diverse. So that means you also need to broaden your support. How do you do that? SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Well, I'm very excited about our chances here. We just had a double digit poll out of one of the newspapers. I also just got the Las Vegas Sun endorsement, and we've had huge events here, over a thousand people in Reno. We're building up our staff all over the country, actually in the Super Tuesday states, because finally, I've gotten the resources I need, over $12 million just in the little over a week since the New Hampshire debate-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have to pl-- SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --because regular people--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --play a little catch up there.\u00a0 SEN. KLOBUCHAR: That's for sure. But for me, I look at Las Vegas and Nevada, I see this. I'm the leader on tourism in the U.S. Senate. Big- big employers here. Number two, I've been good on union issues and stood by working people. My whole background is a union background, my grandpa, my dad, my mom. Third, two women U.S. senators here. Majority women in the legislature. They are lo- used to electing women and they're very proud of it. And then finally, since the moment I got to the Senate, I worked on immigration reform. Ted Kennedy asked me as a new senator to be in the small group that worked on it when George Bush was president. Unfortunately, we came close. We didn't make it. I worked on it again when Obama was president. And as president, I will get it done. So I'm actually been having a lot of fun out here, not to mention it's nice to be in the sun. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, roughly 19 percent of Nevada's population was born outside the U.S. I mean that's a significant portion, fifth largest in the country. You're getting criticized this week because you are just now making some changes to your immigration position. And you also said English- you reversed your position on whether English should be the national language. Do you think that reversal this week actually won you support? SEN. KLOBUCHAR: That wasn't this week. And- and understand not everyone's following every twist and turn of this campaign. But I said this way, way back, months and months ago, back in Miami when I was asked by a journalist. That- that was an early vote on English as the official language. A number of other Democrats voted the same way, and actually nearly all Democrats eventually voted for it. It was in the base bill. I know that's not a good idea because it would be hard to translate brochures and voting materials and the like. And I was glad after working on the latest version, the 2013 immigration bill, that that wasn't in there. It shouldn't be in there. MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the specifics of what you would do differently, Joe Biden did an interview with Univision in which he was pressed over the deportations of three million people during the Obama administration. He says now that was a big mistake. Do you believe it was a mistake for the administration to deport people who did not have criminal records? SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I think that that went way too far, yes. And I think you've seen a lot of that across our country. The question is, what do we do going forward? And to me, the very straightforward answer is comprehensive immigration reform. It would save $158 billion in reduction on the deficit in just 10 years. And part of that money, when you talk about deportations, could be used for our asylum process, to improve that. Part of it could be used to help those Northern Triangle countries and allow people to seek asylum from those countries. I would immediately, as president, stop the heinous practice of separating kids from their parents at the border in my first 100 days. MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask about issues around race. Michael Bloomberg has come under some criticism for his time as mayor: stop-and-frisk, past public comments he's also made that are now viewed as insensitive, to say the least. You yourself have said there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system. You were a prosecutor. And if you look at the black and white prison rates in the county where you served, there are disparities. So for you as a candidate, do you have regrets about your tenure? SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I think anyone involved in the criminal justice system, including me, we know that it must be changed. And I, back then, knew that there were issues. We actually saw a 12 percent reduction in African-American incarceration rates during my eight years leading the office that handled about ten to fifteen thousand cases a year. I pioneered a new form of eyewitness identification, working with the Innocence Project to try to reduce racially discriminatory misidentifications. I reviewed all of our DNA serious cases to check to make sure there were not issues with those cases. And I diversified the office. But as for what Michael Bloomberg did, I- stop-and-frisk, that is unconstitutional. And I'll say this, I am on your show right now, MARGARET, answering these tough questions. Where is he? He just keeps running a bunch of ads. He'll probably have more ads during your show in certain states than I'm on answering your questions. I think he cannot hide behind the airwaves and the money. I think he has to come on the shows. And I personally think he should be on the debate stage. I'm never going to beat him on the airwaves, but I can beat him on the debate stage.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar, thank you very much.\u00a0 SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, MARGARET. It was wonderful to be on. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.",

            "article_content": "As the votes come in Tuesday night, the answer to some of the election's most pressing questions may be found in the new battleground state of Arizona. It has many of the key voting groups that will be pivotal in a host of close states, and an early-voting system that has been tested in the past and has been tabulating votes for two weeks, meaning we'll know who the bulk of those voters picked by the end of the night. Joe Biden has enjoyed a small, but consistent lead in Arizona since the summer thanks to suburban women, seniors and Latinos. Which suggests the one-time home of American conservatism could be changing in the same way the country is, becoming more diverse and more educated. But Democrats thought that in 2016 too. That long line of green envelopes you see marching together contains just some of the record number of completed mail-in ballots from Arizona voters. First, they are processed through state-of-the art machines, then they're sent to ballot tabulation centers for counting.\u00a0 Arizonans of both parties have been voting safely and easily by mail since 1992. This election, for the first time, state officials started tabulating ballots 14 days before the election. As of tonight, millions of early votes have been processed. The results sit in secure servers, those red and blue machines, that are sealed, transparent and not connected to the internet. And no one knows what those results are. Katie Hobbs: We're allowed to post results an hour after polls close, so 8 p.m. on election night here in Arizona. Katie Hobbs is Arizona's secretary of state and chief election officer. John Dickerson: On election night, how much will it be an advantage that you will have been able to start counting for 14 days? Katie Hobbs: That's a huge advantage, particularly over states that are seeing a huge increase in the volume of voting by mail and statutorily aren't able to start processing ballots until that day. We're certainly going to be ahead of them. That anyone is holding their breath about the outcome of the race in Arizona is notable. It's a longtime Republican state, but it is changing. Seven million people now live in Arizona, spurred by America's fastest-growing county, Maricopa County. The home of Phoenix and Tempe, it's also known for its blooming suburbs. It accounts for 60% of Arizona's vote and no Democrat has carried Maricopa County since 1948. John Dickerson: Traditionally, would we be in a ruby red part of Arizona? Yasser Sanchez: Maricopa County is the largest county that Trump won the last election. And so this is the center of Trumpville in Arizona. If Arizona turns blue it will be in part because of voters like Yasser Sanchez and his wife, Emily, conservatives who live in the Maricopa County suburb of Gilbert. In 2016, they never saw a Hillary Clinton sign in their neighborhood. Now the streets by their house are dotted with Trump and Biden signs poking from the alternating beach towel-sized front lawns. They've added a new entrant in the sign wars: Arizona Republicans for Biden. Yasser and Emily are voting for a Democrat for the first time. John Dickerson: So how's that goin' over? Emily Sanchez: I've noticed people coming out of the woodwork, but interestingly enough, silently. They'll come and say, \"Hey, I see that you're supporting Biden. I am too. But I can't really tell anyone,\" or, \"I can't tell my family.\" John Dickerson: So people talk about shy Trump voters. Are there shy Biden voters? Emily Sanchez: Absolutely. COVID-19 has hurt Donald Trump in the state. The virus hammered Arizona in June and July, making the state the hot spot in the nation at one point. Yasser, Emily and four of their five kids all got the virus at the same time. Emily Sanchez: For me, the campaign is personal. It is no longer political. John Dickerson: Why? Emily Sanchez: Because we've personally gone through COVID-19. We have also seen worse where friends have died. Yasser Sanchez: And for the president to dismiss it as no big deal or the flu or just play politics with it, it's more than offensive. It, it enrages me. It makes me so angry. So angry, Yasser helped organize an unusual coalition of latinos, liberals and conservatives who convened on a recent Saturday morning to launch a unique parade. A caravan supporting Joe Biden in former Republican strongholds. While that mile-long procession was blaring its way through Maricopa County. A three-mile long caravan of Trump supporters served as a reminder that as much as Donald Trump may rankle some in his party, he is also revered. This past Wednesday, the president touched down in a suburb of Phoenix for another packed rally. It was Donald Trump's seventh visit to Arizona this year. At a smaller gathering for conservatives on the edge of Maricopa County, the rallying cry was for low taxes, law and order and personal freedom. Dr. Kelli Ward: We need to make faces great again, breathing great again, you know, person-to-person communication great again. We met Dr. Kelli Ward, the chairwoman of Arizona's Republican party who twice launched unsuccessful campaigns for the U.S. Senate from the party's right flank. John Dickerson: Why is Arizona, which is the state of Barry Goldwater, John McCain, I mean, this is a Republican state. Why is it even in question? Dr. Kelli Ward: Well, obviously the country is changing. It seems like there is a sea change politically across the board. A lot of people from California have come to Arizona. John Dickerson: There is a tension in the party in Arizona between kind of one wing and the other, that seems like President Trump is right in the middle of that tension. Dr. Kelli Ward: I think it's a manufactured tension. This isn't about a person. This is about policies. When you put those before the people without Donald Trump attached to them, they love them. John Dickerson: So is that the challenge? To get people to see on the other side of the, the man who's at the top? Dr. Kelli Ward: I think the people have to be smarter than, than many times the media who is putting things out as though it's all about Orange Man Bad, when it's really about Republican policies good. John Dickerson: But Donald Trump is not shy, he's not a-- he's not a retiring type\u2026 Dr. Kelli Ward: Well, I'm thankful\u2026 I'm thankful that he isn't shy. Because I can tell you what didn't get us the White House, it was whenever we had those shy retiring Republicans, who just wanted to get along, to go along, who let Democrat policies be shoved down the throats of the American people, who have led us to the brink of socialism. Donald Trump took control of the situation. John Dickerson: Let me ask you\u2026 I've talked to some suburban Republican women. Dr. Kelli Ward: Yes. John Dickerson: And some of the ones I've talked to love Donald Trump, some have left the party because of it and this is a challenge. How's he doing with suburban women now? Dr. Kelli Ward: I think he's doing great with suburban women. Women, women love Donald Trump. There are some who have been sadly brainwashed by things that aren't really even true across the board about the president. We hear\u2026 John Dickerson: Now, Dr. Ward, you're not saying that women can't think for themselves are you? Dr. Kelli Ward: No, I'm saying the media lies. And, and\u2026 John Dickerson: But they're smart enough to get around that\u2026 Dr. Kelli Ward: Are they? I mean, you know, if you hear it and hear it and hear it and only that, you tell a lie often enough, it becomes the truth. One famous exile from the new Arizona Republican Party is Cindy McCain, the widow of John McCain, a man who once defined that party. John Dickerson: What are they missing in the current Republican leadership now that-- that is not\u2026 Cindy McCain: Well, the-- the willingness to work together. Somehow you have to either be on this side or this side, and there's no in-between. Gosh, if you're a Democrat, we're not going to talk to you. They no longer put country before party. It's the opposite right now. The Trump-McCain feud dates back to the last campaign when Trump won Arizona by three and a half points. But Cindy McCain said she was pushed to speak out after the Atlantic magazine reported derogatory comments President Trump allegedly made about military service members. Her endorsement of Joe Biden in September was local front page news. Cindy McCain: For me, the final straw was the, you know, 'They're losers and suckers.' John Dickerson: The Atlantic article and the\u2026 Cindy McCain: The, the Atlantic article. You know, I'm the mother of two veterans and a wife of a veteran, and my father was a veteran. They were not losers and suckers by any chance. It angered me a great deal. It angered me. And so I thought, you know, I can either sit here and be angry or I can do something. John Dickerson: And when you made that decision did you get blowback? Cindy McCain: Yeah (laughs). John Dickerson: What form did that take? Cindy McCain: All kinds of forms (laughter). But you know the blowback does not matter to me. It's, it's about doing what's right of the country. And I, like many people couldn't sit back anymore. Arizona's political profile mimicked the cactus that dots its landscape \u2013 prickly, resistant to change, capable of living for years without outside help. This land of canyons has been the home to two GOP nominees, Senator Barry Goldwater and Senator John McCain.\u00a0 Arizona retained its Republican character until recently. Now, Arizona may be on the verge of electing Democrat Mark Kelly, which would give the state two Democratic senators for the first time in 70 years. Republican Jeff Flake represented Arizona in the Senate until early last year. John Dickerson: Did you ever imagine that a red state like Arizona would suddenly be thick with Democratic politicians getting elected? Jeff Flake: Not at this stage. I mean, you look in the future and you think, \"Unless a Republican Party, you know, transforms a bit and appeals to a broader electorate then, you know, we're gonna be irrelevant.\" That's, that's always been you know, far in the future. But did I envision it this fast? No. Not at all. John Dickerson: So President Trump is accelerating the changes in\u2026 Jeff Flake: Definitely\u2026 John Dickerson: \u2026Arizona right\u2026 Jeff Flake: If you run a candidate, a Republican candidate statewide for state mine inspector, for example. We do have one (laughs). Nobody pays attention to that race. And the Republican will win handily. So it's still a center right state. But not President Trump's style of politics. That just doesn't play well for a lot of independents and a lot of moderate Republicans. It didn't play well for Flake. Jeff Flake during Senate speech: We must never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals\u2026 He left the Senate after one term because President Trump and his base had turned against Flake's independent streak, once the hallmark of Arizona Republicans. Flake has endorsed Joe Biden in this election. John Dickerson: For Arizona, is this election a referendum on President Trump? Jeff Flake: Most definitely. Yeah. I mean, you have an incumbent coming in, the economy was good and strong, anybody with those kinds of odds, an incumbent ought to be winning. But more than anything, it's the president's handling of the coronavirus. It's just the whole schtick I think people are tiring of. Before Donald Trump even ran for president, his spiritual predecessor, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, tracked down and jailed undocumented immigrants. Latinos, who make up a third of Arizona's population, like 19-year-old Alexis Delgado Garcia, remember those days. Born in this country, Alexis is the son of undocumented parents. Alexis Delgado Garcia: Here in Arizona, it was really, really difficult to even go to the grocery [store]. Going to\u2026 John Dickerson: Why was it difficult to go to the grocery [store]? Alexis Delgado Garcia: The fear of my parents getting deported, the fear of my parents not seeing me again or seeing my family again was very, very huge. John Dickerson: So are you involved in canvassing to spare other people of color what you went through? Alexis Delgado Garcia: Yeah. Alexis and twin sisters, Evelynne and Yoshi Rodas Castillo, are part of a wave of young American-born Hispanics who have come of voting age\u2026they canvassed door to door on a 97-degree day, trying to spur people to vote for joe biden. John Dickerson: Evelynne, why did you get involved in canvassing? Evelynne Delgado Garcia: So knowing that both of my parents are undocumented, that they can't vote, that I have a lot of other family members who are undocumented, who can't vote themselves, I know it's so important that, you know, I'm the voice for those who can't. Ninety percent of Arizonans are expected to vote by mail or early in-person. The question, of course, is on election night what will their voices and their ballots tell us about Arizona and the country? John Dickerson: If Donald Trump wins Arizona, what will he have done? Jeff Flake: Defied the odds (laughs). John Dickerson: Will he have found voters for him that kinda came outta the woodwork? Jeff Flake: Yeah, I mean, when you look at those rallies, I mean there's something to that. We learned that in 2016. John Dickerson: If Joe Biden wins Arizona, what will that mean for election night? Jeff Flake: If he wins Arizona, if Arizona's results come in more quickly, as we think they will, he's got it. If you could put together as a Democrat, put together a campaign that could win this state, you're gonna win the country. Produced by Draggan Mihailovich. Associate producer, Jacqueline Williams.

            "article_content": "A federal judge in Alabama\u00a0blocked\u00a0the state from enforcing a trio of restrictions for absentee and curbside voting for the state's July 14 runoff election amid concerns from voters who say they are at a higher risk of severe illness from the\u00a0coronavirus, according to\u00a0CBS News digital reporter Melissa Quinn. Four Alabama voters and three organizations challenged the requirements and asked the federal district court to issue an injunction blocking the state from enforcing the measures. The voters said the Alabama election laws at issue \u2014 the requirement that absentee ballots must be signed by a notary or two witnesses, the requirement that absentee voters must submit a copy of their photo ID and Alabama's effective ban on curbside voting \u2014 ran afoul of their right to vote. U.S. District Judge Abdul Kallon, appointed by former President Obama, sided with the voters Monday in waiving the absentee ballot requirements in at least three Alabama counties and lifting the prohibition on curbside voting at in-person polling locations for next month's election. The court\u00a0ruled the \"burdens imposed by the challenged election laws on voters at high risk of severe complications or death from COVID-19 are not justified by the state's interests in enforcing the laws.\" \"No one should have to risk their health to vote,\" Deuel Ross, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which brought the suit, said in a statement, adding that the order means \"tens of thousands of vulnerable people will now have a safe means of voting in July.\" The voters who challenged Alabama's absentee ballot restrictions and limitations on curbside voting argued the state's election laws forced them to choose between risking their health by leaving their homes and engaging in person-to-person contact or foregoing their right to vote during the coronavirus pandemic. But Alabama election officials said the laws were crucial to protect the integrity of its elections by preventing voter fraud and safeguarding voter confidence. Kallon wrote in his ruling that if the election laws at issue were allowed to be enforced, the plaintiffs in the case and others in similar situations \"could likely face a painful and difficult choice between exercising their fundamental right to vote and safeguarding their health, which could prevent them from casting a vote in upcoming elections.\" The coronavirus pandemic upended the 2020 election season as officials in many states rushed to expand vote-by-mail and limit in-person voting to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. More than a dozen states delayed their primary elections. Alabama's runoff was scheduled for March 31, but Governor Kay Ivey postponed it to July 14 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The state, which is among those experiencing a surge in infections, has had more than 25,000 confirmed cases and more than 700 deaths.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN With a boost from Senator Elizabeth Warren, Vice President Joe Biden's campaign had its most successful fundraising event yet Monday evening, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. A 620-person Zoom fundraiser held by the presumptive Democratic nominee and his former rival raised $6 million. \"Thank you for asking your friends to help me out,\" Biden told Warren, according to a pool report from the event. \"It's the biggest fundraiser we've ever had. And it's all because of you.\" Warren had sworn off private fundraising events for herself as a presidential candidate, but left open the possibility of helping another nominee. \"I'm going to help the party. I'm a team player here, and I don't want to see Democrats unilaterally disarmed,\" she told CBS News in October. The fundraiser came as Biden searches for a running mate, a job Warren has said she would take, and a week after another with potential pick Sen. Kamala Harris, which raised $3.5 million. PRESIDENT TRUMP President Trump emphasized the need to respect and support law enforcement as he signed an executive order on Tuesday addressing policing reforms amid a groundswell of civil unrest,\u00a0CBS News digital White House reporter Kathryn Watson\u00a0reports. The president signed the order in the White House Rose Garden surrounded by representatives of law enforcement, with no representatives of Americans affected by police brutality on the White House's attendee list. Families of several victims of police brutality did meet with the president before the signing. Mr. Trump's order is shaped by three key components: credentialing and certifying police departments, boosting information-sharing to better track officers with excessive use-of-force complaints and creating services for addressing mental health, drug addiction and homelessness. But it doesn't make federal funding conditional to those reforms, but instead potentially prioritizes some grants for departments that meet all those guidelines. \"Reducing crime and raising standards are not opposite goals,\" the president said from the Rose Garden Tuesday. Mr. Trump said chokeholds should be off limits unless an officer's life is at risk. Last week, the president said chokeholds seem \"perfect\" and \"innocent\" at first, but he'd generally like to see an end to them. In a new\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed, Vice President Mike Pence accused the media of \"fear mongering\" and said the ringing of alarm bells over a second coronavirus wave are \"overblown,\" reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. Pence touted the administration's achievements over the last few months, highlighting the country's increased testing capabilities while mentioning that \"more than half of states are actually seeing cases decline or remain stable.\" Pence added \"the media has tried to scare the American people every step of the way, and these grim predictions of a second wave are no different. The truth is, whatever the media says, our whole-of-America approach has been a success.\" The op-ed published while the vice president was in Iowa for a trip to highlight the country's reopening. His first stop at Sally's Restaurant, a diner in Forest City that re-opened Tuesday after shutting down because of the coronavirus, underscored that message. Pence had lunch at Sally's Restaurant with Governor Kim Reynolds and State Senator Randy Feenstra, who recently defeated long-time 4th district congressman Steve King in the Republican primary. The vice president was not wearing a mask at the restaurant but greeted patrons with elbow bumps and told them Iowa always reminds him of growing up in Indiana.\u00a0 After lunch, Pence toured Winnebago Industries and, according to pool reports, he wielded a nail gun during the tour to assist some of the workers laying the foundation of a Winnebago. Following the tour, Pence promised to restore the economy by building on administration's agenda from the first three years. Pence said \"together we will open up America again\" and touted the 2.5 million jobs that were added in the month of May. The vice president also spoke about the death of George Floyd. He called Floyd's death, as he has several times in recent weeks, a \"tragedy\" and a \"disgrace.\" It should have never happened, Pence said, adding that there is no excuse. But, the vice president said there is also \"no excuse for rioting and looting.\" Pence said he and the president will respect the concerns of protesters, \"but we are not going to defund the police.\" Vice President Pence said a center piece of the administration's \"transition to greatness\" will be law and order. The Biden campaign characterized Pence's second trip to Iowa in less than two months as \"damage control.\" Biden's deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield said Pence is trying to \"rewrite history today,\" adding the Trump administration's \"corrupt recovery is leaving Iowans in the dust.\" Meanwhile Republican National Committee Spokesperson Preya Samsundar said Pence's trip to the Hawkeye State is \"another sign of the great American comeback.\"\u00a0 PRESIDENT OBAMA Former President Obama will have his first campaign event for Joe Biden next week. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and his old boss will both take part in a\u00a0grassroots virtual fundraiser\u00a0on June 23. This comes after Mr. Obama endorsed Biden with a video in April and promised to hit the campaign trail with him. But as the presidential campaign cycle remains predominantly in virtual mode,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says an in-person event has not happened yet. According to an email to Biden supporters promoting the virtual event, the two will use the appearance to talk about Biden's vision for the country. \"This is a critical moment in our history -- and we need Americans of all backgrounds and political stripes to join together and fight to create a more just, more generous, more democratic America where everybody has a fair shot at opportunity,\" read the email signed from Mr. Obama. NEVADA CASINOS CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. This week\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0highlights\u00a0casino workers in Nevada.\u00a0In April, the state posted the worst unemployment rate\u00a0in the country and the nation's largest surge in unemployment, with nearly 1 in 3 workers left jobless. But some of the immigrants that make up much of the state's workforce, including the undocumented (more than 1 in 10 of Nevada's workers), the\u00a0largest share of any state and those with\u00a0temporary protected status, are ineligible to collect many of the benefits that have buoyed American families through the pandemic. \"All of us were laid off, including me, my wife, all my relatives, my friends, everybody in this thing. How are we going to keep it up with the bills? How are going to keep food for our kids?\" says Nery Martinez, who lives in Southern Nevada with temporary protected status. Martinez, a member of the Culinary Workers Union who had worked as a bartender in Caesars Palace, was one of 90% of the company who was\u00a0furloughed\u00a0earlier this year.\u00a0\u00a0 FEMALE LEADERS On the heels of nationwide demonstrations calling for solutions to systemic racial inequity, EMILY's List has announced that it will launch an inaugural fellowship aimed at training women community leaders from \"historically\" underserved communities.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the EMILY's List Ignite Change Fellowship will be a nine-week virtual initiative, where 30 women will learn in part, how to run for office, build community relationships and tell their personal story. According to the press release, the fellowship is focused on engaging women of color, LGBTQ women and non-binary people, women from rural communities and women with disabilities. \"Now more than ever, we're seeing the need for leaders who truly have their finger on the pulse of their community,\" said Stefanie Brown James, vice president of training and community engagement at EMILY's List, in a statement. \"As activists and community advocates lead the shift in how underserved communities and communities of color are being treated, it becomes crucial that the shift happen politically.\" FLORIDA Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez and Congresswoman Val Demings of Florida weighed in on the president's executive order on policing during a press call on Tuesday with the Florida Democratic Party, where the party scrutinized the president's record.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that Demings \u2014 a former police chief \u2014 said that while the president is \"on the right track\" by calling for the creation of a national database that would create a federal database of police officers with a history of using excessive force, his executive order on policing does not go far enough to address recent events that have taken place with officer-involved killings of black men in Minneapolis and Atlanta. \"He's still campaigning and not looking at the obvious problem right in front of us,\" said Demings. \"We've got to make sure that we're number one, acknowledging that systemic racism still exists and it rears its ugly head\u2026the president has a major role there.\" Demings added that the Department of Justice has a responsibility to strengthen the Civil Rights division of the department and establish federal guidelines that law enforcement agencies can use to determine how officers are hired and trained. \"The president, rather than issuing executive orders, ought to order his attorney general to do his job,\" echoed Perez in his criticism of what he described as a \"woefully inadequate\" move by the president in signing the order on policing. The DNC chairman said the attorney general has a \"pattern of practice tool\" at his disposal that enables the DOJ's Civil Rights Division to investigate and file civil lawsuits to correct patterns of misconduct among police departments. \"Attorney General Barr is not only not enforcing or using the 'pattern of practice' tool, he's affirmatively hostile to the tool,\" said Perez. \"He has this old school belief that you're either on the side of the community, or you're on the side of the police. That is a false choice.\" In addition to tracking officers with excessive use-of-force complaints, CBS News\u00a0reports\u00a0that the president's order will also create services for addressing mental health, drug addiction and homelessness. While federal funding isn't conditional to these reforms, it potentially prioritizes some grants for departments that meet specified guidelines. IOWA Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds told reporters on Tuesday that she will issue an executive order that restores felon voting rights before the November election, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. \"We're working on that right now, sitting down with various groups, listening to what they think is important what is contained in that executive order,\" Reynolds on Tuesday told\u00a0Radio Iowa in Osage. \"And then I've got my legal team working on it.\" Iowa is the only state that permanently bans all felons from voting unless the governor approves restoring someone's right to vote.\u00a0As of 2016, about 10% of the state's African American population was unable to vote because of a prior felony conviction. Activists from Black Lives Matters have urged Reynolds to use her executive power to grant felon voting rights, but she hadn't confirmed that she planned to do that until Tuesday. \"We have an important election coming up,\" Reynolds said. \"We're working on the language to see what that looks like, but hopefully it would mirror what we would put in a constitutional amendment so that we could be consistent in what we're trying to do.\" The details of the order are still unclear. The\u00a0Des Moines Register noted that it may include some restrictions on which felons can automatically get their voting rights back, such as those who committed certain crimes or requiring felons to pay full victim restitution before they can vote. \u00a0 OKLAHOMA The first term mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma, G.T. Bynum issued an ominous statement expressing his anxiety ahead of the Trump campaign's rally planned for Saturday at the city's 19,000-seat downtown Bank of Oklahoma arena. \"Was the nation's first large campaign rally after the arrival of COVID-19 my idea? No,\"\u00a0 Bynum posted on Facebook, noting that the city did not learn of the Trump campaign's plans until the BOK Center management contacted the city about police support for the event. \"Do I share anxiety about having a full house at the BOK Center? Of course. As someone who is cautious by nature, I don't like to be the first to try anything. I would have loved some other city to have proven the safety of such an event already,\" the mayor wrote in his candid post. While some officials in deep-red Oklahoma have welcomed the rally in with open arms,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says Bynum has balanced national politics with a surging COVID-19 case rate and Tulsa's deep racial wounds, punctuated by the 99th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre. The Trump campaign plans to provide hand sanitizer stations and masks and will require all attendees to pass a temperature check before entry. \"We are not going to suddenly abandon the state's plan, to be either more lenient or more severe,\" the mayor wrote. The city of Tulsa does not plan to block state government or the president by invoking the local civil emergency authority in the city ordinance. Oklahoma State Department of Health urged senior citizens and vulnerable individuals to \"stay home\" Saturday ahead of the rally and \"enjoy the event through live streaming or a recording.\" The department has tripled its contact tracing team ahead of the event. Oklahoma provides free COVID-19 testing at centers across the state, including a dozen in Tulsa county. \"As outlined by the CDC, individuals looking to attend Saturday's event, or any other large-scale gathering, will face an increased risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and becoming a transmitter of this novel virus,\" Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye said in a statement. Reverend Al Sharpton is planning to keynote a Juneteenth rally in downtown Tulsa on the eve of Mr. Trump's event,\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion\u00a0reports. The June 19 rally will commemorate the end of slavery in the United States and take place in the historic Greenwood district. In the days after World War I, the prosperous neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was among the wealthiest black communities. In 1921, an enraged white mob burned Greenwood to the ground, killing as many as 300 black individuals. June 1st marked the 99th anniversary of what became known as the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. TEXAS Texas Democrats on Monday officially filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to lift a block by a lower court to allow all Texas voters, regardless of age, to request a mail ballot \"to avoid transmission of the [COVID-19] virus.\" The plaintiffs are also asking for the Supreme Court to hear a case in the fall on whether Texas' mail ballot restrictions violate the 26th amendment, which says a vote shall not be denied on account of age. This is the latest effort by the state party to expand the mail vote in the state, which only allows \"no absentee\" ballot requests to come from those over 65 years old. The Texas Democrats have\u00a0previously seen\u00a0their state case put on hold, as well as opposition from Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that on a press call on Tuesday,\u00a0Texas Democrats' general counsel Chad Dunn said he'd need the Supreme Court to weigh in or lift the block put in place by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court as soon as possible, before the July 14 runoff and November election. Dunn argued the lower court's decision is an outlier, as similar cases have been ruled differently in other circuit courts, while the 5th Circuit Court also encompasses Louisiana and Mississippi, two other states with voting restrictions. \"There's no logical reason for those whose 65th birthday is the day after Election Day to have to go to the polling place in person while their 65-year-old spouse can vote a mail ballot \u2014 especially during the worst pandemic in a century,\" Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement.\u00a0 IN THE SENATE ARIZONA Over the weekend, Arizona Senate candidate Mark Kelly joined the ranks of Democrats that have criticized demands to defund or dismantle police departments, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"That's not the approach here. We need reform of policing,\" Kelly told\u00a0a local radio station. Earlier this month, his GOP rival Senator Martha McSally\u00a0had been quick to accuse Kelly of being willing to \"nod along\" to a \"dangerous\" idea that Biden had appeared open to. But the former vice president\u00a0has since distanced himself\u00a0from the calls, as have other Democrats challenging vulnerable Republican incumbents in\u00a0Colorado and\u00a0North Carolina. \u00a0 MONTANA The Montana Democratic party unveiled Tuesday a new site that targets incumbent Republican Senator Steve Daines on his record. In addition to the new site, the party has released a new five-figure digital ad buy targeting his record, according to the state party. The investment is the latest expense in a race that has seen more cash flow from campaigns and outside groups since former presidential candidate and Democratic Governor Steve Bullock entered the race in March. According to data from Kantar/CMAG, Senator Daines' campaign and Republican groups have spent almost $17 million and Governor Bullock and Democratic outside groups have spent over $10 million in ad reservations this year, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Early in the cycle, Montana wasn't close to the top level of competitive races, but in recent months, Montana has moved in terms of ad spending ahead of other races that have been watched closely like Michigan, Georgia, and Texas.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

            "article_content": "With just over 20 days to go until the election, Joe Biden and President Donald Trump are revving up the number of ads airing on TV. Biden continues to outspend the president on ads according to the latest tracking by Kantar/CMAG, a trend that has been playing out since the end of July with the former vice president outspending the president in some cases two to one on TV ads over the past few weeks. CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0reports President Trump is currently spending more than $17 million on TV ads in 11 states this week. At the same time, Joe Biden is currently spending more than $24 million in 16 states. Just yesterday, Kantar/CMAG tracking also showed the Trump campaign cut more than $10M in TV ad reservations in 9 states while adding some spending in just 3 states. Biden's ads have been focused on his plans regarding the economy and combatting COVID-19. On Tuesday a new ad aired taking aim at the president, directly mentioning his testing positive for COVID-19. \"He was warned but ignored the evidence, holding rallies indoors, turning the White House into a super spreader and contracting the virus himself,\" says the narrator. \"Now he claims he's learned about COVID-19...But he hasn't learned a thing,\" it continues. At the same time, President Trump is also now running an ad on coronavirus and how he's recovering. It aired for the first time Saturday, the same day he had his White House event. In the ad he says they will live \"carefully.\" This past week, the Biden campaign has also started airing ads featuring Samuel L. Jackson and Cindy McCain while both Biden and Mr. Trump are taking aim at each other over Medicare and Social Security, a clear play toward seniors. Both candidates have also touted criminal justice plans. The president's latest ads have continued to include warnings about law and order and the \"radical left's\" plans. Images of Sen. Bernie Sanders have appeared numerous times in ads taking aim at Biden. In the president's latest TV ad to air Tuesday for the first time according to tracking, the My Pillow guy and Trump supporter Mike Lindell holds a roundtable with voters of \"both parties\" where they take aim at Biden. Tonight, President Trump heads to Johnstown, PA where he is expected to deliver remarks targeting democratic opponent Joe Biden during an airport hangar rally -- his second since contracting COVID-19, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. According to released excerpts from the campaign, President Trump is expected to say, \"For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of American Workers. He should not be asking for your votes, he should be begging for your forgiveness.\" The incendiary remark follows a call for civility today from Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney, who condemned the \"vile\" and \"vituperative\" nature of American politics, blaming President Donald Trump in large part. Mr. Trump will also call Joe Biden a \"servant of the radical globalists, wealthy donors, and special interests,\" who shipped away American jobs, according to his prepared remarks. Under 8 years of the Obama administration, the economy gained a net 11.6 million jobs. Average weekly earnings for all workers were increased by 4.2% accounting for inflation. The President, campaigning for the second day in a row in a battleground state, will also attack Biden for his stance on fracking, law enforcement, and climate change. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0reports that Cambria County, where Johnstown is, was once reliably Democratic, but has gone to a Republican presidential candidate in three of the last four elections. In 2016, Mr. Trump grew the Republican lead there from 18 to 27 points. It's surrounded on all sides by now reliably Republican counties, each of which Trump won in 2016 with at least 65% of the vote. Over 5,000 showed up for the Johnstown event, according to a Fire Department estimate. The majority of audience members were not wearing masks, and attendees with whom CBS spoke overwhelmingly said they had no concerns about catching the virus at this close-quarters outdoor event where the campaign administered temperature checks at the entrance. \"I take precautions if I'm in a crowded place indoors. But [today], the air's going to blow everything away,\" said Kathy Nagle of nearby Blair County. \"I view it this way: If God wants me to get it, I'm going to get it,\" said Edward Young, who travelled to the event, his 41st Trump rally, from Brick, NJ. Young, who voted for Obama twice before Trump, said he sees Trump as a \"superhero,\" and that the president's COVID recovery cemented that status. \"The great plague that has leveled our country, a 74-year-old man gets over it in four days and now he's doing just fine,\" he said. \"He's back doing rallies. It's like what Nietzsche said. That which does not destroy him makes him stronger.\" Earlier today, the Trump campaign announced that Vice President Pence will return to Florida on Thursday after he held an event there on Saturday. Meanwhile, President Trump is also going to make a return trip to the Sunshine State on Friday after having campaigned there yesterday. That's four trips from the Republican ticket to Florida in less than a week, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. Pence campaigned in Wisconsin on Tuesday where he touted the Trump administration's record on trade. Pence said he was in the room when President Trump negotiated the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal and claimed that the USMCA is a much better deal for Wisconsin workers. Pence also attacked Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on other topics like law enforcement, climate change, and abortion. \"If you cherish faith and freedom and law and order and life, three weeks from today you need to do everything in your power to work, to voice, to vote to reelect President Trump for four more years,\" Pence said in Wisconsin. Pence said Biden and Harris don't want to answer the question on court packing because they want to add liberal judges to the court. \"We might have been born in the morning but we weren't born yesterday morning,\" Pence said. \"I mean, the only explanation about why they aren't answering the question is because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are planning to pack the court with liberal judges if they win this election, but we're not gonna let it happen,\" Pence added. Last night during a local interview with WKRC in Cincinnati, Biden did say he's \"not a fan of court packing.\" The Trump campaign also launched a new TV ad today to highlight the President's achievements for American seniors. The ad is part of this week's 8-figure buy and will run on national cable and specific local markets in Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Maine, Minnesota and Nevada. President Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. is set to return Wednesday to Arizona and Nevada, the latest Trump campaign surrogate to stump through the two states rallying the president's supporters. \"My only disappointment is not being able to stay longer. But my father has me working quite hard these days,\" President Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump\u00a0said Monday, capping her own swing through the two Western states with an outdoor event in Southern Nevada, says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. President Trump himself had been scheduled to headline Arizona rallies in Tucson and Flagstaff in early October, before the events were cancelled over his COVID-19 diagnosis. His campaign has not announced any new visits to the battleground state as he returns to the campaign trail, though the president did phone in over the weekend to Arizona to rally supporters\u00a0in a \"tele-rally.\" Former Vice President Biden appeared at a drive-in event in Miramar, Florida Tuesday evening which is part of Broward County, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. Because this was a drive-in event, instead of applause, viewers got to hear car horns where pauses were taken for applause. Biden had a lot of energy as he walked up without a mask (the podium was wiped down), but he did put a mask right back on after his remarks. During a fired-up speech, the former vice president was practically shouting at times. Biden continued to slam Trump for his coronavirus response and downplaying the virus saying \"the American people do not panic. Donald Trump panicked,\" and claiming, \"three more weeks until we end this madness.\" While Biden has long been criticizing Mr. Trump for his response, today he also took aim at the Trump campaign ad \"Carefully\" that quotes Dr. Anthony Fauci. \"The most respected doc in the country on this issue is Dr. Fauci. He referred to the president's announcement of the Supreme Court, at a political event in the Rose Garden, or in the backyard of the White House, he called it a 'super spreading event.' Look at all the people who became contagious and got ill,\" said Biden. \"And how is he responding now - he, Trump, is running a national ad on television, you may have seen it, taking...Dr. Fauci out of context.\" Biden also took aim at racial injustice during his speech but called for law enforcement to be able to do their jobs without \"extremists and vigilantes.\" He did not spend much time on the Supreme Court hearing but did slam the hearing in regards to the ACA. \"We've got to protect your health care,\" he said. \"In the middle of this pandemic, why do the Republicans have time to hold a hearing to pack the court instead of providing economic relief... for localities? I'll tell you why. It's about, it's about wiping out the Affordable Care Act, wipe it off the books. Because their nominee said in the past that the law should be struck down. That will take away health care for 20 million Americans.\" At the very beginning of his speech, Biden called it \"Go time,\" and noted \"We win Florida and it's all over.\" At numerous times he reminded his audience to make sure they vote, by mail, by drop-box, or in person. At his first campaign event earlier in the day, Biden appealed directly to the older community members in Pembroke Pines, Florida talking about Social Security, Medicaid and President Trump's temperament as it relates to the pandemic. \"To Donald Trump it's simple. Not a joke. You're expendable. You're forgettable. You're virtually nobody. That's how he sees seniors. That's how he sees you,\" Biden said, referencing comments the president made at a rally saying the\u00a0virus affects \"virtually nobody.\" CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says Biden also mentioned how he had prayed for Trump's recovery from COVID-19, but said \"his reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis is unconscionable\" and that \"the longer Donald Trump is president the more reckless he seems to get. Thank god we only have three weeks left to go.\" The former VP was particularly fiery when talking about Trump's 'losers' and 'suckers' comments about the military, as well as his acknowledgement to journalist Bob Woodward about how dangerous the virus is. \"He knew it was a dangerous and highly communicable disease. But he did nothing. He didn't do a thing. He didn't tell you! He didn't tell any American!\" Biden said. Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who said she supported Biden's 1988 presidential run while in college, introduced him Tuesday and made note of the power of the senior vote in Florida. When Donald Trump, Jr. visited Fayetteville, N.C. on Saturday, it was on the heels of a visit his father had made to the city just three weeks prior, and it was an appeal -- at least in part -- to the military veterans in the area. The stop also came just days after former Second Lady Jill Biden also visited Fayetteville, the county seat of Cumberland County, to speak with veterans and military families. Dr. Ngozi Kamalu, a political science professor at Fayetteville State University, told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that Cumberland County, the 5th largest county in the battleground state of North Carolina, is politically significant for a variety of reasons, including being one of four North Carolina counties in which the Fort Bragg U.S. Army military base is located. With nearly 57,000 military personnel and 11,000 civilian employees, Fort Bragg is one of the largest military complexes in the world according to the U.S. Army\u00a0website. \"Home of the Airborne and Special Operations Forces,\" Prof. Kamalu noted that the diversity of the military population of Fort Bragg \"reverberates\" throughout the county. \"For anybody who wants to win the military vote, Fort Bragg is one of the places you need to win and Cumberland County is just very contiguous to it,\" said Prof. Kamalu, who added that it's going to be \"very hard\" for a candidate to win the state without winning Cumberland County. However, Prof. Kamalu conceded that while North Carolina may be a toss-up state, Fayetteville's Democratic mayor, the composition of the city council, and the county's expanding racial diversity may make it an area that Democrats could win again. Still other political scientists believe Republicans like Mr. Trump could have a fair shot at winning over some of the county's 221,658 registered voters. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won Cumberland County, capturing 56% of the more than 127,506 votes cast in the county. President Trump received 40% of the vote with just over 51,000 votes. In 2012, President Barack Obama beat out Republican challenger Mitt Romney by a slightly larger margin of 19.69%, winning 59% of the 127,641 votes cast in that presidential election. In the latest edition of CBS News COVID Chronicles\u00a0campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0explored how Florida educators are continuing to address the digital divide that has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. When CBS News first\u00a0spoke\u00a0with Leon County Schools Superintendent Rocky Hannah in July, the county had made an $11 million investment to purchase more than 32,000 laptops that his team planned to distribute to every student in the school district before the school year started. But due to back orders, the laptops did not arrive before classes began in August, so the county instead distributed 9,000 desktops to students who opted to work remotely. As of this week, the shipment of laptops have started to arrive and Hannah's team plans to run a pilot program with three schools, where they will distribute laptops to the students at an elementary, middle and K-8 school before passing out to the other students in the district. And while Leon County Schools and partner organizations like the South City Foundation continue to look for ways to expand technological access and support to students, Hannah contends that the pandemic is far from over. \"Let's be clear: this pandemic is not over and it's not going anywhere in the near future,\" said Hannah. \"We're going to continue to monitor and work with our families daily and meet them again where they're comfortable.\" Read the full story\u00a0here. Former President Obama is urging Americans to make a plan to vote. In a new Democratic National Committee video, the former president walks voters through a tutorial on options, including vote by mail, early voting in-person and voting on Election Day, reports\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion. \"So much is at stake in this election -- from getting the pandemic under control to building a fairer economy to taking on climate change to protecting our health care,\" Mr. Obama says in the opening seconds. \"And when it comes to voting this year, having a plan has never been more important.\" The ad series, released Tuesday, includes specific voting instructions for 24 states. Obama also promotes the website, IWillVote.com, which allows voters to request and return ballots by mail and learn more about the voting process. His wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, is also trying to build momentum around early voting. Her non-partisan organization, When We All Vote, announced a new partnership with Lebron James' group, More Than A Vote. Both entities will launch two weeks of action from October 18-31, dubbed \"When We All Vote Together.\" Mrs. Obama said, \"Millions of Americans have already cast their ballots and with only 21 days until Election Day, making your plan to vote early is critical. It's now up to us to do everything in our power to get our friends and family ready to vote early and safely together.\" The groups will provide over $1 million in grants to local organizations that host voter activation events. They will also provide transportation, personal protective equipment (PPE) and offer voter protection support to individuals who live near early voting sites. In-person events are slated in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, Orlando and other cities. Additional partners include Black Entertainment Television, Comedy Central and MTV, which are divisions of ViacomCBS. In an unsigned order, the Supreme Court granted the Trump Administration's request to stop the census count immediately, instead of allowing the count to go until October 31, reports\u00a0CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford. Because of the coronavirus, the government had extended the original deadline for responses to the census questionnaire from July 31 to October 31. But in early August, it changed the deadlines again, announcing it would stop the counting on September 30 - leading to a dispute over another month of counting. When the Census Bureau announced the original extension back in April, it also sought to extend the deadline for sending the count to the President for apportionment from Dec. 31 (as required under the Census Act) to April 30, 2021. Apportionment is when the latest Census data is used to allocate how many Congressional district each state gets. But in early August, before Congress could agree to extend the reporting deadline, the government switched course (a \"Replan\") and said it would end data collection on Sept. 30, with a report to the President on Dec. 31. The administration said it needed to end the counting to be able to get the report to the President, as required by law. But that also happened to be a couple weeks after President Trump announced he would seek to exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted for congressional apportionment. Several advocacy groups then sued to block the \"Replan,\" arguing it would\u00a0result in a heavy undercount. A district court agreed to reinstate the original extensions. The appeals court split the difference and reinstated the Oct. 31 collection deadline while allowing the Dec. 31 reporting deadline to the President. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissent and said, \"the harms associated with an inaccurate census are avoidable and intolerable.\" Officials in Arizona's most populous county say they expect to have much of their ballots counted and ready to report by November 3rd, thanks to upgraded equipment and a new state law allowing counties to begin tabulating results two weeks ahead of Election Day, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"It's our goal to include nearly all ballots returned to the Elections Department by the end of the month in the first 8 p.m. results report on Election Night,\" Megan Gilbertson, communications director for the Maricopa County Elections Department, said in an email. More than 80% of votes cast by Arizonans in 2018 were returned early in-person or by mail, according\u00a0to federal data. And, amid the coronavirus pandemic, both campaigns have urged their Arizona supporters to cast their ballots early or by mail this cycle, with Joe Biden's team repeatedly touting its\u00a0\"first week voter\"\u00a0efforts in the state. The California Republican Party said it has no plans to remove ballot collection boxes\u00a0after state officials called them illegal yesterday\u00a0and ordered Republicans to take them down immediately. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Attorney General Xavier Becerra issued a cease and desist order yesterday and threatened further legal action if the state party doesn't remove ballot collection boxes that appeared in Los Angeles County, Orange County, and Fresno County over the weekend. \"When we got the cease and desist order yesterday, we were trying to go through it and trying to figure out what election code we're actually violating,\" CA GOP spokesman Hector Bajaras told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. Barajas added that the boxes are legal and within the scope of the law. He said that his party's ballot harvesting operation is no different than Democrats collecting ballots at union halls. The controversy over the ballot boxes flared up over the weekend when a regional field director with the California Republican Party in Orange County tweeted a photo of himself holding a vote-by-mail ballot, standing next to a black cabinet with a taped sign that read \"official ballot drop off box.\" The staffer, Jordan Tygh, encouraged voters to message him for \"convenient locations\" to drop off their ballots. Barajas acknowledged mistakes were made with how signage on the ballot boxes and said the wording on them was fixed on Sunday. \"We'll eat some crow here. We could've used better wording on it and we made that correction on Monday,\" Barajas said. The GOP spokesman said staffers are assigned to collect ballots from those boxes every three days, in accordance with the law, and the ones that were collected over the weekend have been turned into the local counties. One of several options California voters have to return their mail-in ballot is choosing someone they trust to drop the completed ballot at a county elections office. In 2016, the law was expanded to allow volunteers, campaign operatives, and private organizations, in addition to close family members, to return a ballot. The ballot must be signed by both the voter and the person collecting it and dropped off at a local election office within 72 hours. Barajas argued that state assembly bill 306, signed into law in 2018, does not disqualify a ballot solely because a person returning it did not provide on the identification envelope his or her name and relationship to the voter or a signature. \"We want to make sure that the California secretary of state can catch up to the laws on voting and dealing with ballots as opposed to continuing to go out there and give some untruths,\" Barajas said. Padilla's deadline for the California Republican Party to remove the ballot collection boxes is for Thursday but Barajas said they're pushing ahead and even looking to add more boxes. \"We've gotten requests for more (boxes) and so you know we're going to look and maybe we'll double or triple our efforts,\" Barajas said. Nearly one million Michiganders have voted in the general election, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0As of Monday morning, 977,694 people had returned their absentee ballots in Michigan, the Michigan Secretary of State's office told reporters on Tuesday. 2.85 million Michiganders have requested absentee ballots for the election, meaning a little over a third of requested ballots have been returned. At the same point in 2016, about 916,000 people had requested absentee ballots and nearly a quarter million had returned them. Michigan voters passed a constitutional amendment in 2018 to allow for no-excuse absentee voting. In August, a record 1.6 million people voted absentee in Michigan. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has projected 3 million people or more may vote absentee during the general election. NEVADA Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske confirmed reports of misprints in two rural counties\u00a0in a statement late Monday, after a\u00a0local NBC station\u00a0said some voters were confused by an error on materials for their mail ballots, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. In one county, return envelopes had asked voters to sign \"under penalty of perjury\" that they were registered voters of a different county in the state hours away. Nevada, which this year mailed ballots to all voters due to the coronavirus pandemic, had faced an earlier snafu over the all-mail contest: several of the state's counties postponed mailing out ballots last month\u00a0citing delays\u00a0with their ballot printing vendor. \"In both counties, the county clerk is reprinting the materials that contain incorrect statements and will send the corrected materials, along with a letter explaining the issue,\" Cegavske said, adding that the issues will have \"no effect on whether their mail ballot will be accepted and counted.\" TEXAS Texas saw long\u00a0lines\u00a0in some cities during its first day of early voting and record-breaking turnout in at least one major area, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. There are an extra six days of early voting in Texas for the general election to give voters more options due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 68,000 people cast votes by early afternoon in Harris County, home to Houston and the state's most populated county, which broke the county's record for the first day of early voting, according to the\u00a0county clerk. There were reports of some problems around the state. In Fort Bend County, which borders Harris County and is home to the Houston suburbs, there were issues with some voting machines. The Fort Bend County Judge, the county executive,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0that \"those who are responsible will be held accountable\" and later said that the machines had been\u00a0fixed\u00a0at the county's largest voting center. In Tarrant County, which is home to Fort Worth, one site opened two hours late after an election worker reported testing positive for COVID-19 on Monday night and officials had to find replacement staff. Hours before early voting began, a panel of federal appeals court judges on Monday night sided with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on his order allowing only one drop-off site per county where voters may hand-deliver their mail ballots. Abbott issued an order in late July that would enable Texans to hand-deliver their ballots before Election Day. Normally, absentee ballots in the state must be returned through the mail, except on Election Day, when voters can deliver their ballots in person. Monday night's ruling reverses the lower court decision that blocked Abbott's order on Friday night. The district court judge had concluded that allowing only one site per county imposed a \"burden on an already vulnerable voting population.\" But the three-judge appeals court panel -- all appointees of President Trump -- agreed with the Texas secretary of state's argument that Abbott had already sufficiently expanded absentee voting options during the 2020 election by allowing people to return ballots before Election Day. \"Leaving the Governor's October 1 Proclamation in place still gives Texas absentee voters many ways to cast their ballots in the November 3 election,\" Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan wrote. \"These methods for remote voting outstrip what Texas law previously permitted in a pre-COVID world. The October 1 Proclamation abridges no one's right to vote.\" Texas has seen one of the highest upticks in newly registered voters in the nation reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro, with over 3 million people who registered after the 2016 election. That means just about 1 in every 5 voters in Texas in 2020 were not registered in 2016. Democrats are betting the surge has changed the electorate and could help flip Texas this year. As of Monday, Texas' secretary of state lists more than 16.9 million registered voters in its database, a state record and a net gain of 1.8 million since 2016. This gain is more than the gap in 2016 (Mr. Trump won by 807,179 votes) and 2018 (Senator Ted Cruz won his re-election against Democrat Beto O'Rourke by 214,921 votes). The uptick comes as polls have consistently shown the race as tied or Mr. Trump with a slight lead. Dr. Jill Biden visited Houston, Dallas and El Paso on Tuesday. Democrats say at least 60% of these added voters lean Democrat, because so many of them are young and from communities of color. \"We always say 2020 is the year that demographics meets destiny in Texas,\" said Luke Warford, the Texas Democrats' voter expansion director. The state's GOP state party says they've registered at least 160,000 likely Republican voters and that they're confident in their outreach to other newly registered voters, particularly those who moved from blue states, will dispel any Democrat dreams. \"They don't want to see Texas become like the San Francisco or Manhattan they fled,\" said Texas GOP communications director Luke Twombly.

VIRGINIA The deadline to register to vote in Virginia is midnight Tuesday but for most of the day, the commonwealth's online registration portal was down,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte notes. Officials told CBS News that early Tuesday morning a fiber was cut near one of Virginia's state technology centers which impacted data circuits used to run the Department of Elections' registration portal. A spokesperson for the Department of Elections told CBS News that technicians were on site and working to repair the cut -- which ended up needing work for most of the day. It wasn't until approximately 3:30p Tuesday that the portal was back online. State officials explained that a Verizon crew working on a ongoing utilities project inadvertently cut the fiber early Tuesday morning, cutting off access for Virginia voters. The problem was reminiscent of issues out of Florida last week when the state's online registration portal crashed hours before the registration deadline. Consequently Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said their registration website was overwhelmed with traffic as more than 1 million voters per hour attempted to register in time. The registration deadline was pushed one day in Florida, but a large extension was rejected in federal court.Late Tuesday the Lawyers' Committee sued the Virginia Depart of Elections and the State Board of Elections to extend the deadline by 48 hours. A new\u00a0Monmouth poll\u00a0released on Tuesday focusing on North Carolina found Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham's admission of extramarital flirtatious texts has not severely impacted the race. In the poll, Cunningham is leading Republican incumbent Thom Tillis in a high turnout situation by 49 % to 44% compared to 47% to 45% in September. A model based on low turnout has the race closer at 48% to 47%. Though Cunningham's unfavorable number has grown from 22% to 33%, just 14% of voters feel the sexting relationship disqualifies Cunningham, and a majority (51%) believe this should just be an issue for Cunningham and his family. Incumbent Republican Senator Thom Tillis tested positive for COVID-19 at the beginning of October, but more North Carolina voters know about Cunningham's sexting (80%) than about Tillis' positive test (69%.) Half of the voters (50%) said Tillis did not take the pandemic seriously enough before he came down with it himself.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0and\u00a0campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0spoke to voters\u00a0in North Carolina last week who did not feel the recent events surrounding either candidate would cause them to switch their votes.",

            "article_content": "While President Trump faces bruising poll numbers amid the coronavirus pandemic\u00a0and financial crisis, his family business continues making money off his reelection bid,\u00a0report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0and\u00a0political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice.\u00a0On March 31\u00a0and\u00a0April 1, Trump Victory \u2013 a joint fundraising committee between the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee \u2013 made a series of 43 separate payments to Trump Hotel Collection totaling more than $380,000 according to the joint fundraising committee's latest quarterly filing with the Federal Election Commission. The records describe the payments as \"facility rentals\" and range from more than $2,600 to $10,000 each. The same filing reveals another payment of more than $19,000 to the Trump Hotel Collection at the beginning of March, bringing the total spent by the committee at Trump properties to more than $400,000 in the second quarter of the year.\u00a0 According to Trump Victory, the 43 payments made over those two dates were for events that had \"already happened.\" According to a source familiar with the arrangement, the payments needed to be broken up because Mar-a-Lago's credit card machine caps at $10,000. The Republicans' joint spending at Trump properties has become routine for both the GOP and Trump campaign.\u00a0Records show since the start of 2019 through the first quarter of 2020, the committee spent more than $1.3 million at Trump properties. Some of the biggest payments over the past two years include a $75,000 payment to Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey in the third quarter of last year and a $126,090 payment to the Trump Hotel Collection in the first quarter of 2020. In 2019, nine payments totaling more than $105,000 also went to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC between April and June. An RNC official stated factors such as security, prices and convenience are all part of the committee's decision-making process. Apart from its joint fundraising committee, the Trump campaign committee has also been making payments to Trump properties since the president began his first presidential bid in 2015. Over the past two years, the Trump campaign has spent about $940,000 at Trump businesses.\u00a0 One of its larger payments is a recurring monthly payment of $37,541 to Trump Tower for rent of campaign facilities.\u00a0 The campaign has also made several payments amounting to more than $86,000 to the Trump Corporation for \"legal & IT consulting.\" The Trump campaign declined to comment on the rental fees. FEC filings from the 2016 campaign show the Trump presidential committee alone paid Trump businesses more than $12.2 million over two years and at least another $1.4 million in 2017 and 2018. In 2016, the biggest share of the $12 million paid to the Trump Organization was for air travel. The New York Times noted that Mr. Trump paid his company $8.7 million to reimburse it for his air travel on his own plane. Now, he travels on Air Force One, and there is always an official White House visit paired with any campaign events. While it does not raise the same legal questions, Mr. Trump's businesses have also been getting a boost from the Republican National Committee amid re-election efforts. Since the beginning of 2019, the RNC has spent at least $911,000 at Trump hotels federal filings show. One of its largest payments was for $491,702 at Trump National Doral Miami near the beginning of the year.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN From the medical response to the economic response, Joe Biden was in Delaware on Tuesday and lashed into President Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"He's quit on you and he's quit on this country,\" Biden said. For his part, Biden is focusing on increasing funding to the caregiving community in his latest proposal to revive the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports.\u00a0 In the third arm of his \"Build Back Better\" jobs plan that was released on Tuesday, Biden focuses on childcare and eldercare, calling it a \"21st century caregiving\" model. Through this investment in quality, affordable care, Biden promises 3 million new jobs to aid those Americans out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic or who are underemployed. \"This is about easing the squeeze of working families,\" Biden said while laying out the plan in remarks in Delaware on Tuesday. \"I know it's hard to think of future when you're just trying to get through the crisis at hand.\" \u00a0Biden says he will allocate $450 billion to give more seniors the choice to receive care at home or \"in supportive community situations.\" Specifically, the former vice president wants to target the 800,000-person Medicare waitlist for home and community care by increasing Medicaid funding to states. For low-income and middle class families, Biden wants to offer a tax credit of $8,000 to help pay for child care. Other ways to assist with this universal childcare goal is capping childcare costs at 7% for low-income families, the price deemed by Health and Human Services Department when childcare begins to be unaffordable. In other Biden news, his campaign upped their TV ad buy with $15 million this week in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The topic of the new ads revolve around COVID-19 response and includes a Spanish language ad on the economy. But one voter Biden does not have to court is conservative columnist and Trump critic George Will who said during an Aspen Institute conversation that he already plans to vote for Biden in November. PRESIDENT TRUMP President Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday seeking to prevent undocumented immigrants from being counted in the 2020 census for the purpose of apportionment, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0The population numbers in the census dictate how many seats in the U.S. House of Representatives a state has. Mr. Trump in a statement said, \"My administration will not support giving congressional representation to aliens who enter or remain in the country unlawfully.\" The American Civil Liberties Union has called the order unconstitutional. The Trump campaign is hosting its first nationwide virtual fundraiser with President Trump Tuesday night. Mr. Trump has not been a presence on the Trump Campaign's virtual events since they started up in March until this past weekend when he hosted four tele-rallies focusing on Wisconsin, Arizona, Michigan, and North Carolina. The event Tuesday is hosted by Trump Victory Finance Committee National Chair Kimberly Guilfoyle, according to a press release. The virtual fundraiser follows Monday's fundraiser at The Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC that raised $5 million for Trump Victory, according to an RNC spokesperson. ELIZABETH WARREN In a New York Times op-ed published Tuesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren argued for a four-pronged approach to COVID-19 recovery for the country. \"It is not possible to fix the economy without first containing the virus,\" she wrote. \"We need a bold, ambitious legislative response that does four things: brings the virus under control; gets our schools, child care centers, \u00a0businesses, and state and local governments the resources they need; addresses the burdens on communities of color; and supports struggling families who don't know when the next paycheck will come.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says the op-ed came ahead stimulus negotiations that were planned for later in the day. Warren's plan consists largely of proposals she's already made, such as a $50 billion childcare bailout and a set of guaranteed rights for essential workers during the pandemic. She also wrote that the next pandemic relief package should give states at least $500 billion in aid, allocate at least $175 billion to help public schools reopen safely and invest $350 billion into communities of color hit particularly hard by the pandemic.\u00a0 WISCONSIN SCHOOLS CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of Americans in 2020 amid the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0spoke\u00a0to Joyce Peoples, a middle school English language arts teacher in Milwaukee, who said she thought that she might spend a few weeks away from the classroom when Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers shut down schools in mid-March as COVID-19 started spreading across the country. \"We were thinking, OK, we'll be closed for [a few] weeks and then spring break and then just going to wait for things to calm down,\" Peoples said. Her students \u2014 and 75,000 others in Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) \u2014 did not return to the classroom. When it was clear students wouldn't be returning any time soon, challenges arose, including reaching students' families, communicating plans for the road ahead and making sure students had devices and internet access for virtual learning. Peoples said remote online learning in the spring provided a \"mixed bag\" of results for her students. \"There's no way that I was able to teach as naturally, the flow of a classroom on a computer,\" Peoples said. \"So there were things lost, but I also think that there were things that were gained. And I think what was gained was that children learned to adapt.\"\u00a0Online learning will continue in Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) in the fall. The\u00a0district\u00a0faces major challenges in ensuring virtual learning is accessible to its whole student body, primarily low-income and students of color. MPS has continued\u00a0providing meals\u00a0to tens of thousands of students who get free breakfast and lunch at school.\u00a0 School districts in Wisconsin have the final say over their plans and some are considering full in-person learning or a hybrid solution, said Jennifer Kammerud of the Department of Public Instruction. A\u00a0survey\u00a0released by MPS last week showed that more than three quarters of parents and students think it's possible to return to school with a virtual option. The staff prefers a plan with two days in-person and the rest of the week virtual. Forty-six percent of parents, 31% of staff and 26% of students said they aren't comfortable returning to buildings this fall. Several parents spoke out against the virtual plan during last week's board meeting. \"What about the parents that have to work for a living? Do we matter?\" a parent asked. Others fear students will fall behind and blasted the district for problems with virtual learning in the spring, which one parent described as \"an abject and embarrassing failure.\" Some parents applauded the district for taking steps to ensure the safety of students and families, but many expressed concerns about how to ensure a quality education for the most vulnerable students.\u00a0Milwaukee\u00a0has had more than 12,000 COVID-19 cases and about 250 deaths. Black and Latino residents make up about 58% of the population, according to\u00a0U.S. Census estimates, but account for about 70% of COVID-19 cases in Milwaukee. MPS comprises nearly 90% students of color. MPS hopes to bring students back in some capacity later in the fall. Teachers during the school board meeting and in interviews with CBS News said they prefer to be in the classroom once it's safe, but said they want to see a drop and downward trend in cases, along with plenty of protective equipment and sanitizing supplies. \"I don't want to have to attend any virtual funerals,\" Nicolo Onorato, a high school special education teacher, told CBS News. \"I don't want to have to see any of my students or colleagues lose their lives.\" PARTY PLANNING CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that\u00a0Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry told reporters on Tuesday that he agrees with Duval County Sheriff Mike Williams' assessment that the city is not prepared to host the Republican national convention, which is just 34 days away. CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0Tuesday that Williams said he has \"significant concerns with the viability of the event.\" However, during Tuesday's press conference, Curry added that Williams has communicated he plans to continue working with convention planners to secure resources that will allow his team to plan a safe event. According to the mayor's team, they have requested up to $35 million from the Department of Justice through a securities grant and are expecting notification of an awarded budget in the coming days. As previously\u00a0reported\u00a0by\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson, the Jacksonville Host Committee for the Republican National Convention has stated that convention admission would be limited to regular delegates for the first three days. In a memo obtained by\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, the RNC said there would be an area outside of the convention venue, designated as the \"Festival Venue Area,\" that will be accessible to all delegates, alternates, and guests Monday through Thursday of the convention. The committee also announced health measures for the convention, which will include on-site temperature checks, available PPE, sanitizing protocols, and available COVID-19 testing. According to the memo, every potential convention participant attending in Charlotte or Jacksonville will be sent an in-home COVID-19 test paid for by the RNC. Only participants who test negative will be allowed to attend the convention activities. GUEST LIST Following reports that the Democratic National Committee\u00a0had approached former Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Republican, to speak at their convention next month, DNC member Brianna Westbrook, an Arizona Democratic Party vice chair and former top Bernie Sanders surrogate, pledged Monday to \"aggressively push back and organize against\" the move. More than 100 delegates have already\u00a0co-signed Westbrook's letter to the party's leadership that welcomes Kasich's support for Democrats but cites a number of issues \u2014 from curbing public sector unions to signing abortion restrictions \u2014 where the Republican feuded with Democrats in Ohio. \"It started in Arizona, and then started doing outreach to other state delegations, just starting with Bernie supporters and then the outreach started to the Biden delegation. And that's really when we started to realize: 'oh, this isn't just a progressive issue. It's not just the Bernie delegates who are upset about this,'\" Jade Duran,\u00a0a Sanders delegate from Arizona, told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. A convention spokesperson declined to confirm whether Kasich would be speaking at the event, saying \"programming details are still being finalized.\" Duran added, \"It was really surprising to me that he would be invited to speak when he's basically gone against everything that our party stands for and everything that we're fighting for.\" NEVADA Blaming the \"heavy-handed approach\" of Nevada Democratic Governor Steve Sisolak, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt announced Monday that his Annual Basque Fry and the upcoming CPAC West planned in Northern Nevada\u00a0has been canceled amid the coronavirus outbreak. Laxalt said \"more than 2,000\" had bought tickets for the event next month which had\u00a0been slated to feature a number of conservatives, including Trump campaign advisor Mercedes Schlapp and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Despite concerns following news of a CPAC attendee testing positive for coronavirus\u00a0in March following their gathering in Washington, organizers had initially sounded confident of the event's prospects. CPAC West attendees were also asked to agree to a \"waiver of liability\" for potential COVID-19 exposure. \"We're going to be there come rain, come shine, come whatever they're going to throw at us,\" Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union,\u00a0had vowed in June.\u00a0 PENNSYLVANIA All five of Pennsylvania's living former governors and more than a dozen former elected officials in the state have teamed up in an effort to educate voters on how to safely cast ballots in November, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. VoteSafe on Tuesday launched a bipartisan coalition in the state to \"raise awareness among Pennsylvania residents so they know what voting options are available to them under the state's constitution and according to county election laws,\" according to a press release. The effort comes after Pennsylvania saw a 17-fold increase in mail-in and absentee voting in its June primary and as Mr. Trump has questioned whether it's secure. \"Mail-In Voting, unless changed by the courts, will lead to the most CORRUPT ELECTION in our Nation's History,\" Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. The Pennsylvania coalition, however, called mail-in voting \"safe and secure\" in a press release and said the pandemic has increased the need of Pennsylvanians to know their voting options. \"It is highly unlikely that polling locations will operate as usual in November, or that the voting experience will be anything close to normal, given the lingering effects of COVID-19,\" former Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Dave Reed, co-chairman of VoteSafe PA, said in a statement. \"We need to do all we can to ensure Pennsylvania voters have accessible, secure mail-in ballots and safe, in-person voting sites.\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP After a tense exchange at Tuesday's House GOP Conference, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz called for House GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney to step down from her position. First reported by\u00a0Politico, Gaetz tweeted \"Liz Cheney doesn't view her role as chair of the conference as one of serving the Republican members. She seems to think we're there to serve her. That's not leadership.\" The disagreements stem from Cheney's comments criticizing Mr. Trump's response to the pandemic, as well as her support of Todd McMurtry, who challenged, and lost to Congressman Thomas Massie in a primary. Politico reported that Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs also attacked Cheney of \"undermining the GOP's ability to win back the House.\" Biggs' House office did not respond to CBS News for clarification.\u00a0 Biggs heads the Freedom Caucus, which Gaetz is a part of, a group that has previously butted heads with those in Republican leadership.\u00a0 Donald Trump Jr. also jumped in,\u00a0tweeting, \"We already have one Mitt Romney, we don't need another...we also don't need the endless wars she advocates for.\" At a press conference, Cheney said \"Donald Trump Jr. \u00a0is not a member of the House Republican conference\" and that she takes her leadership position \"very seriously.\" I'm honored to serve as the House Republican Conference chair and particularly honored to serve the people in my own way,\" she said, calling the disagreements from earlier a \"healthy exchange of views.\" POLLING & ADS Meanwhile, after\u00a0several weeks of polls released by House Democrats, the Congressional Leadership Fund and National Republican Congressional Committee have been steadily releasing their own internal polls in targeted districts reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In Iowa's 3rd, a\u00a0poll of 400 registered likely voters in the district found that incumbent Democrat Cindy Axne remains virtually tied with former Congressman David Young. A\u00a0poll in New Mexico's 2nd district also shows a tie between Congresswoman Xochitl Torres-Small and GOP challenger Yvetter Herrell. Neither poll showed the toplines for how the presidential race would play out in these districts, though Torres-Small holds a seat that Mr. Trump won by 10 points in 2016. The House GOP-backed Congressional Leadership Fund also released three polls in recent weeks, two in targeted Democrat-held districts and one for an incumbent Republican. In\u00a0Utah, the poll found Republican Burgess Owens ahead of incumbent Democrat Ben McAdams by 9 points. The poll also found Mr. Trump with a 6 point lead against Biden in this district, which he won by 6.7 points in 2016. In Virginia, the poll showed Democrat incumbent Elaine Luria tied with former Congressman Scott Taylor. Like other vulnerable House Democrats, Luria holds a massive fundraising advantage, with\u00a0$2.88 million to Taylor's roughly\u00a0$311,000. Lastly, a poll in Pennsylvania's 1st district showed incumbent Republican Brian Fitzpatrick up 15% against Democratic challenger Christina Finello. This is in contrast with two internal Finello campaign polls showing the race tied.\u00a0 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released new ads across Texas on Tuesday morning. Their ads are running in three targeted districts in Houston and Dallas suburbs, Texas' 10th, Texas' 22nd and Texas' 24th. The committee will be airing ads in\u00a0Hindi and\u00a0Chinese\u00a0in Texas' 22nd district, the first time ever in the Committee's history. Sri Preston Kulkarni, the Democratic candidate in Texas' 22nd, is running to become the first person of Hindu faith in Congress. \"We need to start reaching out to all communities if we want to build the coalition we need to overcome the hate and divisiveness that pervades our political system. That's why we're talking to voters in 21 different languages,\" Kulkarni\u00a0tweeted. The\u00a0ad itself attacks Nehl's record as Fort Bend County Sheriff, showing news clips of him downplaying reports of human trafficking in the state and problems of jails under his overview being out of compliance with state law.\u00a0 \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Guatemala City\u00a0\u2014 Guatemala has sent back almost 3,500 Honduran migrants from a caravan that was heading to the United States over concerns they might spread COVID-19, President Alejandro Giammattei said on Sunday.  In a televised message, Giammattei said Guatemalan security forces were able to \"contain\" the caravan, that according to the president was a factor in the transmission of the virus.  \"We are experiencing a pandemic in Guatemala which has cost us to control with months of efforts,\" said the president, adding it was an \"obligation\" to reduce the risk of further contagion. According to the Guatemalan Migration Institute (IGM), the caravan entered eastern Guatemala on Thursday, pushing over a military cordon on the Corinto border before splitting into groups to reach Mexico, which has closed its borders. In recent years, thousands of Central American migrants traveling in large groups have crossed into Mexico, with the aim of reaching the U.S. border. The migrants have become a hot-button issue for political conservatives in the United States, including President Donald Trump's base.  Mr. Trump, who is seeking a second term in the November 3 election, has threatened Mexico with steep tariffs if it does not do more to stop a surge of undocumented migrants. By Friday and Saturday, hundreds of Guatemalan police and military personnel set up roadblocks forcing migrants \u2014 including young children and people in wheelchairs \u2014 to turn back.  Fifteen people from the caravan requested refuge in Guatemala, according to the IGM.  \"We respect the right to migration as long as it is regulated and the requirements and protocols that have been established are complied with, and not as happened with this group of migrants who broke into our country with violence,\" Giammattei said.  COVID-19 has infected 93,963 people and killed 3,293 since March in Guatemala, a country of about 17 million inhabitants.  The country began reopening in July after four months of restrictions to curb the pandemic.",

            "article_content": "Though the Census Bureau reversed its decision to delay reporting data from the 2020 Census to states, experts warn states should still prepare for delays, which will in turn slow the process of redrawing their legislative and congressional districts.\u00a0The census results are used for apportionment, which determines how many congressional districts each state is allotted according to its population. For instance, the outcome of the 2010 Census meant that Texas gained four seats, and Florida gained two seats, while New York and Ohio each lost two seats in the House of Representatives.\u00a0The onset of COVID-19 stalled data collection for three months, and the Census Bureau has relied heavily on virtual outreach to remind people to respond. Field work has resumed now, and census takers are visiting households of those who have not yet responded. So far, the bureau says 65% of households have responded, and field collection is scheduled to end on September 30. Initially, the coronavirus prompted the bureau to delay its data collection deadline to October 31, and its delivery of the apportionment counts to the president to the end of April 2021. States were expecting to receive this data by July 31, 2021. \u00a0 But the Census Bureau then decided to compress its timeline, ending field data collection a month early, in September 2020. The deadlines for apportionment and redistricting data were slashed by four months, and states are now set to receive their data by March 31, 2021.\u00a0 This would also mean that President Trump would receive the apportionment data by the end of this\u00a0year. Mr. Trump issued a\u00a0memo in July\u00a0saying that undocumented immigrants would be excluded from the apportionment count.\u00a0 On Thursday, Justice Department attorneys, arguing on behalf of the Census Bureau, said in a\u00a0court filing\u00a0that the bureau has \"already begun taking steps to conclude field operations.\" The Justice Department is representing the bureau in a lawsuit filed by the National Urban League, which is suing to extend the bureau's data collection operation. The Justice Department added that any extension \"could not be implemented at this point without significant costs and burdens to the Census Bureau.\"\u00a0The bureau's timeline for when states will see its 2020 decennial data could have an outsized impact on New Jersey and Virginia. That's because the two states hold state legislature and gubernatorial elections in 2021. Even if the handling of the census data were taking place under normal conditions \u2014 without the impact of the coronavirus \u2014 they would be receiving the data in February 2021 and would have a tight window to draw new legislative maps and carry out their elections.\u00a0\u00a0Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center, said it would be close to \"impossible\" for the two states to draw new maps if data isn't delivered by the end of summer. But given the levels of data that states will need, he said the \"prudent thing for states would still be to plan for some sort of delay.\"\u00a0In late July, the New Jersey Legislature approved an amendment saying if the data is not delivered by February 15, 2021, redistricting would be put on hold, and current maps would be used for the 2021 elections. The amendment will be on the ballot in November.\u00a0\u00a0Assemblyman John McKeon, who proposed the amendment, said the state won't get high-quality census data in time to redistrict. State Senator Nick Scutari sponsored the amendment and fears rushing the redistricting process could result in an undercount, which might impact representation and federal funding for New Jersey.\u00a0\u00a0McKeon said the state could go to court if the Census Bureau \"tries to shove numbers down our throat that are going to be inaccurate and cost us multi-millions, if not billions, of dollars over the next ten years.\"\u00a0\"They're going to a plan of, 'Don't worry about it. We can accurately predict from what we have.' I mean, give me a break,\" McKeon said.\u00a0On August 18, a letter from the Office of Inspector General expressed concern that the Census Bureau would not have enough field employees to carry out its shortened deadline. It said that while the bureau aimed to hire just above 300,000 enumerators for field data collection, as of August 17, it only had 220,000.\u00a0\"[Non-response follow up] enumerators represent a final opportunity for the Bureau to reach households who have not responded, including historically hard-to-count communities,\" the letter said. \"To address these priorities, hiring and retaining sufficient enumerators is vital.\"\u00a0The Government Accountability Office also released a report warning the compressed timeframe would undermine the quality of the count.\u00a0In Virginia, if the data comes in too late, it would likely ask the state attorney general for approval to use its current maps for 2021, rather than rushing to redraw.\u00a0\u00a0The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments wrote a letter on August 6, calling on the Senate to extend 2020 census operations by four months, as part of the next coronavirus legislation. The council said that the administration's proposal to \"rush major census operations will throw the complex census contingency plan into turmoil and result in incomplete data\" that undermines how trillions will be allocated.\u00a0State Senator George Barker, a council member, said while he made it clear a census delay would affect Virginia's 2021 elections, \"everybody was fine with that.\"\u00a0\"They'd rather have an accurate count for the whole decade, and be able to at least use an accurate count to come up with (district) lines,\" he told CBS News.\u00a0\u00a0Several Democratic governors, and Republican Vermont Governor Phil Scott, sent a joint letter to the Census Bureau and Commerce Department asking them to extend census data collection to October 31, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Changes in the federal census timeline are also closely watched in California, which because of its size and population, tends to receive its data later. Its constitution sets a deadline of August 15, 2021 to receive data in order to draw new maps, though the legislature is mulling a delay until December 2021. California is also considering postponing its 2022 primaries from March until June 2022.\u00a0\u00a0\"You need to cement districts ahead of time, so candidates know where they're running, said Kathay Feng, the national redistricting director at Common Cause, a government watchdog organization.\u00a0\u00a0Illinois' constitution sets an even earlier deadline, June 3, 2021, for its state legislature to pass a newly drawn map. State Senator Elgie Sims said he expects an undercount with the new census timelines, but Illinois hasn't taken any official action to delay its redistricting timeline.\u00a0\u00a0Sims' district covers parts of Chicago's South Side and adjacent suburban counties, a community he said would \"fall squarely into the hard-to-count category.\" While the state has a nearly 68% self-response rate, parts of his district report at a lower rate of 62%. The national average is 63.5%, according to the Census Bureau.\u00a0\u00a0\"If we have an undercounting of Illinois residents, it could cost us between $1,400 and $1,800 per person. Those are resources that won't go into education and health care,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0The Census Bureau claimed in a statement it would \"improve the speed of our count without sacrificing completeness.\" It says it will follow up with households that haven't filled out the Census yet and will have additional training sessions and reward census takers who \"maximize hours worked.\"\u00a0\"Our commitment to a complete and accurate 2020 Census is absolute,\" said Census Bureau director Dr. Steven Dillingham.\u00a0\u00a0Terri Ann Lowenthal, a census consultant and expert who served as staff director of the House Census Oversight Subcommittee, says some neighborhoods will suffer if the count isn't accurate.\u00a0\u00a0\"People aren't focused on the Census. They're focused on putting food on the table and keeping their families safe,\" she told CBS News. \"And they are going to be hit doubly hard if there is a Census undercount because of the significant amount of federal funding ... that is guided by Census data for the next ten years.\" Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "President Trump and Joe Biden are teeing up to use the Supreme Court DACA decision as a rallying cry heading into the November election. Democrats are celebrating a Supreme Court decision blocking the Trump administration from ending the Obama era DACA program, but they warn the fight is not over, while the president decried the move Thursday, reports\u00a0CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice.\u00a0 The 2012 program protects undocumented immigrants brought into the United States illegally as children. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 with the majority opinion calling the effort to unwind DACA \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the Administrative Procedure Act.\u00a0 This comes as the latest CBS News polling found 85% support allowing immigrants brought into the country as children to stay, including 95% of Democrats, 73% of Republicans and 84% of independents. President Trump responded with a Twitter tirade, calling recent decisions by the highest court \"horrible & politically charged\" that are \"blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives.\"\u00a0 He went on to state the Supreme Court needs new justices, and tweeted that he will be releasing a new list of conservative justice nominees by September 1, and if \"given the opportunity, I will only choose from this list, as in the past, a Conservative Supreme Court Justice...\" He finished with \"VOTE 2020\" signaling this will be a rallying cry heading into November.\u00a0 In a statement, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden praised DACA recipients, but noted the \"joy of today's victory does not erase the difficult road ahead. We know that much work remains to be done. But I will continue to stand with DACA recipients, their parents, and their families at every step, and in November, joined by millions across this country, we will reject the President who tried to rip so many of our family members, friends, and coworkers out of our lives.\"\u00a0 In his own tweet reacting to the Supreme Court decision, former President Obama said he was happy for Dreamers, but said they needed to move forward and elect Biden and a Democratic Congress that \"does its job, protects dreamers and finally creates a system that's truly worthy of this nation of immigrants once and for all.\" FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Joe Biden's presidential campaign announced Thursday it is launching a five-week,\u00a0$15 million advertising blitz\u00a0in six battleground states, its first major advertising effort for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee of the general election, reports\u00a0CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. According to the campaign, the television and digital ads will run in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona \u2014 all states won by President Trump in 2016. There will also be a national cable component.\u00a0 On Thursday, the Biden campaign released three ads that are at the center of its paid media effort. In one spot,\u00a0\"Unite Us,\"\u00a0Biden's voice from a recent address in Philadelphia can be heard saying Americans are suffering. \"The country is crying out for leadership, leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together. That's what the presidency is, the duty to care,\" he says. In another one-minute ad titled\u00a0\"My Commitment,\"\u00a0Biden says that \"this moment has come to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many because if it weren't clear before, it's clear now: This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs \u2014 it was built by the great American middle class.\"\u00a0 He goes on to list essential workers, saying, \"We need to do more than praise them \u2014 we need to pay them.\" \u00a0As part of its investment, the Biden campaign will also be placing both English and Spanish-language content across Florida and in Arizona as part of its outreach to the Latino community. Starting Friday, the campaign will also be making a six-figure investment in African-American print, radio, and targeted digital programming in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina, an effort that coincides with the celebration of\u00a0Juneteenth.\u00a0 The new Biden ad spending was first reported by the New York Times. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP President Trump's rally Saturday will boast a \"festival flare\" with 52 surrogates, musical performers and the president himself slated to address throngs of \"tens of thousands\" of supporters on stages both outside and inside the BOK Center, according to campaign sources. Cameras tracking the day's affairs will produce documentary-style videos of the President's first campaign rally in over 3 months.\u00a0 The mega-rally comes as city officials battle a spike in new coronavirus cases, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. Tulsa County, which includes the city of Tulsa, tracked 96 new infections on Tuesday\u2014its biggest one-day uptick since COVID-19's initial outbreak. As of Thursday, Tulsa County reported 1,825 total cases with 595 active and 64 deaths. President Trump's reelection campaign enlisted former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani this week to lobby for more presidential debates against Joe Biden this fall, beginning earlier than scheduled. The president's team would also like a say in who is to be moderating this year's debates. The move comes as the Trump campaign looks to present voters with a \"choice\" between him and Joe Biden ahead of the November election.\u00a0 The campaign has worked for months to level side-by-side comparisons of the two candidates in hopes it will raise questions about the stamina of the presumptive Democratic nominee, according to multiple campaign aides. Giuliani will convene a Thursday afternoon conference with Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale and Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chairman of the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, to push for more debates. \u00a0 Yet in 2016, the president threatened to boycott the presidential debates before appearing at a podium opposite of Secretary Hillary Clinton. The commission on presidential debates has already scheduled three match-ups to date: September 29 at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, October 15 at the University of Michigan, and October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville. Vice presidential contenders will square off on October 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Politico was the first to report this. CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0reports that in an interview with a local television station in Detroit, Vice President Mike Pence said voters will give President Trump four more years because of the Supreme Court's Decision on DACA today.\u00a0 \"We're disappointed to see the Supreme Court of the United States once again engage in the kind of legislating from the bench that liberal courts have had done over many decades,\" Pence said during the interview with WDIV-NBC. The vice president spent the day in Michigan where he had lunch with Senate candidate John James at Engine House Restaurant.\u00a0 Later in the day, Pence joked that he couldn't decide between the cheeseburger and pasta so he had both and also ordered a pizza to go for the flight back to D.C. Pence toured Chardam Gear Company and delivered remarks to employees at Casadei Steel. As he has said in recent weeks, Pence told the crowd that a centerpiece of the \"comeback\" and \"transition to greatness\" will be \"law and order\" in America. And similarly, the vice president repeated lines he has used in the last few weeks about George Floyd, calling his death a \"tragedy\" and that \"there is no excuse\" for what happened to him.\u00a0 \"But there is also no excuse for the rioting and looting and violence that ensued in cities across this country.\" Vice President Pence also reiterated a promise he's been sharing with voters in the wake of demonstrations across the country: \"We're not going to defund the police.\" Pence said Chardam Gear stayed open throughout the pandemic and did not let go of any of their employees. The vice president thanked the company for the commitment to its workers. He also highlighted Casadei Steel's role in helping General Motors build ventilators.\u00a0 \"Every single day we're one day closer to putting the coronavirus in the past because of the sacrifices of millions of Americans,\" Pence said. CBS NEWS COVID CHRONICLES CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. This week\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0highlights\u00a0the casinos closed in Detroit. Detroit's three casinos collectively employ thousands of workers and provide hundreds of millions of tax dollars to Michigan and Detroit. But the dice, cards and chips have been locked away since March 16. Some workers have struggled with unemployment, and there are concerns that the drop in wagering taxes, Detroit's third-largest revenue source, could create a major budget problem.\u00a0 \"When you're talking about a loss of a half a million dollars a day, it's very, very challenging to plug that gap and to fill that hole,\" said Alex Calderone, managing director of Calderone Advisory Group and a turnaround specialist with expertise in the casino industry. \u00a0Temporarily laid-off casino workers are among the 2.2 million Michiganders who have filed new jobless claims since mid-March. Most of those who have filed claims have been receiving unemployment benefits, but others have had theirs frozen as part of a fraud investigation affecting hundreds of thousands of people. \u00a0 Robin Ryan has worked as a poker dealer for more than 20 years. She received a letter last month from Michigan's Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) asking her to verify her identity. On Wednesday she received benefits for the first time in weeks, when she said she received two weeks' worth of checks of the eight she is owed. Ryan says she's fallen behind on her bills and had to decide between buying food and medicine. She also had cut back on food for her dog and cat at times, saying last week, \"I have to eat, too.\" \"That was downright bad,\" Ryan said Wednesday. \"I had barely any food. I mean there were three days I ate like a tomato and an apple the whole day because I didn't have nothing. I had no money whatsoever. That was terrible.\" ISSUES THAT MATTER SOCIAL ETIQUETE CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0report that Facebook pulled down Trump campaign ads depicting images of an inverted red triangle \u2013 a symbol used by Nazis to designate political prisoners in concentration camps.\u00a0 \"Dangerous MOBS of far-left groups are running through our streets and causing absolute mayhem. They are DESTROYING our cities and rioting - it's absolute madness,\" the ad read above the red triangle image. It went on to call on Americans to \"stand with President Trump against ANTIFA.\"\u00a0 According to the Facebook ad library that specific ad was posted on Wednesday with the potential to reach more than one million people.\u00a0 \"We removed these posts and ads for violating our policy against organized hate,\" said Facebook. \"Our policy prohibits using a banned hate group's symbol to identify political prisoners without the context that condemns or discusses the symbol.\"\u00a0 However, the Trump campaign is pushing back on the use of the symbol. \"The inverted red triangle is a symbol used by Antifa, so it was included in an ad about Antifa. We would note that Facebook still has an inverted red triangle emoji in use, which looks exactly the same, so it's curious that they would target only this ad,\" said Communications Director Tim Murtaugh in a statement to CBS News. \"Whether aware of the history or meaning, for the Trump campaign to use a symbol \u2013 one which is practically identical to that used by the Nazi regime to classify political prisoners in concentration camps \u2014 to attack his opponents is offensive and deeply troubling,\" said Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt in a statement. \"It is not difficult for one to criticize their political opponent without using Nazi-era imagery. We implore the Trump campaign to take greater caution and familiarize themselves with the historical context before doing so. Ignorance is not an excuse for appropriating hateful symbols.\" UNEMPLOYMENT Another 1.5 million Americans applied for jobless benefits last week, a slight drop from the previous week, and another 760,000 people filed for federal assistance for self-employed and gig workers, the Labor Department\u00a0reported\u00a0on Thursday.\u00a0 While the number of claims steadily dropped, there are still millions of Americans receiving unemployment benefits, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0As of the week ending May 30, more than 29.1 million workers were receiving benefits in all programs. This week marked the thirteenth consecutive week where the number of initial claims was more than double the peak during the Great Recession.\u00a0 \"In today's gradually reopening coronavirus economy, hires (or rehires) are now outpacing job losses, but we are still seeing a huge number of people losing jobs,\" Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, wrote in a\u00a0blog post. Shierholz added that the recession is going to \"exacerbate existing racial inequalities\u00a0by causing greater job loss in Black\u00a0and Hispanic households than in white households.\" CONVENTIONAL WISDOM DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION Wisconsin Congressman Mark Pocan says he believes Democrats will \"make the right decision\" when it comes to deciding how to conduct their national convention, but believes it will look different than usual, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0 \"My guess is it's going to be a shortened convention,\" Pocan told reporters on Thursday. \"My guess is it's going to be a partial virtual, partial in-person convention. But I am really concerned about any in-person events, especially that are inside facilities.\"\u00a0 Pocan said Democrats need to listen to doctors and medical professionals and will have to monitor the COVID-19 situation in Wisconsin as the convention draws closer. \"Fortunately, Democrats believe in science,\" Pocan said. \"I think we'll make the right decision.\"\u00a0 While details remain unsettled about how Democrats will conduct their convention, we know Vice President Biden plans to be in Milwaukee to accept the party's nomination during the August convention. \"Democrats are going to have a convention this August where Joe Biden will accept the party's nomination and we will begin the final stretch to ending the Trump Administration,\" Biden campaign spokesman Bill Russo told CBS News in a statement on June 12. STATE-BY-STATE CALIFORNIA Governor Gavin Newsom issued a new guidance on Thursday afternoon requiring all Californians to wear face masks when outside of the house, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar.\u00a0 \"Simply put, we're seeing too many people with faces uncovered, putting at risk the real progress we have made in fighting the disease,\" Newsom said. The new guidance requires residents of the country's most populous state to wear face coverings inside of, or in line to enter any indoor public space, at hospitals and healthcare facilities, waiting for or using public transport, including ride-shares, and in most other situations outside the home. Children under the age of two and those with health conditions will be exempt.\u00a0 \"Science shows that face coverings and masks work,\" said Newsom. \"They are critical to keeping those who are around you safe, keeping businesses open and restarting our economy.\" California lawmakers also passed a bill Thursday to send every active registered voter in the state a mail-in ballot for the November election. It passed with support from several Republicans, despite criticism from GOP leaders, including President Trump. Newsom has already signed an executive order requiring county officials to automatically send mail-in ballots to registered voters but that order was met with legal challenges from the Republican Party. The lawsuit from Republicans argued that Newsom cannot write election laws and it's up to the legislature to determine when and how elections can be administered. The legislature's passage of the mail-in ballot bill arms Newsom in his fight against Republicans. The bill does not end in-person voting, which by state law must still be available. Ballots will not be mailed to inactive voters who have not participated in recent elections. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE SENATE CBS News associate producers Eleanor Watson\u00a0and\u00a0Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0report\u00a0that while vulnerable Senate Republicans up for reelection this year have avoided criticizing President Trump, most are not mentioning their relationship with him in campaign ads, choosing instead to highlight their legislative efforts to help Americans during the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 Since the end of March, Senator Susan Collins' campaign has reserved almost $6 million in television ad buys, according to Kantar/CMAG Data. Nine of the ads focus on her bipartisan work to draft the P.P.P. and pass the C.A.R.E.S Act, the economic relief bill that established the PPP. At the same time, her digital presence on Facebook has touted P.P.P. and what she \"delivers\" for Maine. None of the campaign material brings up Mr. Trump.\u00a0 Senators Cory Gardner, of Colorado, and Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, are also taking this approach. Gardner released an ad with praise from Colorado's Democratic governor, Jared Polis, and Tillis released a digital ad urging a united front in dealing with the pandemic. Republican pollster David Winston told CBS News on the strategy that \"in a crisis like this, most voters are focused on getting things done and want to see the parties working together.\" IN THE HOUSE A number of Georgia and House Republicans have now come out to disavow racist comments made by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican runoff candidate in the state's 14th District. Old videos posted on Facebook by Greene show her equating the 2018 freshman class of Democrat minority women like Ilhan Omar, to an \"Islamic invasion.\" Another clip shows her saying that black and brown people are held back by gangs. \"It's not white people,\" she says in the video.\u00a0 Politico reports\u00a0that the top three House Republicans have disavowed the comments. Chris Pack, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0while they don't get involved in primaries, \"Chairman Emmer is personally disgusted by this rhetoric and condemns it in the strongest possible terms.\" Congressman Jody Hice, who serves Georgia's 10th District,\u00a0posted on Facebook\u00a0that he found Greene's statements \"appalling and deeply troubling, and I can no longer support her candidacy in Georgia's 14th Congressional District.\"\u00a0 Karen Handel, the Republican nominee in the competitive Georgia's 6th District (a district Greene previously ran in), endorsed Greene's opponent Dr. John Cowan on Wednesday.\u00a0 Greene has since then responded publicly,\u00a0tweeting\u00a0that \"MARJORIE GREENE AND NORTHWEST GEORGIA WON'T BE INTIMIDATED BY THE DC SWAMP\" and then criticizing Cowan. \"I'm sick-and-tired of watching establishment Republicans play defense while the Fake News Media cheers on Antifa terrorists, BLM rioters, and the woke cancel culture, as they burn our cities, loot our businesses, vandalize our memorials, and divide our nation,\" she\u00a0added. The Georgia runoff is August 11.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Bad Bunny and Joe Biden \u2014 the world-renowned rapper and former vice president \u2014 are two names not normally associated with one another. \u00a0 But starting Friday, the Puerto Rican rapper, whose real name is Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, and Alejandro Fernandez, a popular Mexican singer, are lending their star wattage and strains from their recent hits to Biden's White House bid.\u00a0 The new ads are tailor-made for Puerto Rican and Mexican audiences in three key swing states and are part of a $26 million advertising buy this week that included a two-minute message that aired on national broadcast networks Friday night during coverage of the Republican National Convention. \u00a0 The Spanish-language advertising comes as recent polling shows Biden maintaining a wide lead over President Trump among Latino voters nationwide \u2014 but a with a narrower advantage in several swing states. Recent CBS News polling show that in Texas and Florida, Biden has about the same level of Latino support as Hillary Clinton did in the 2016 election. In Arizona, Biden's current support is a bit higher than Clinton's was in 2016, which could give Biden an edge there.\u00a0 To boost his support, Biden is set to air a new TV and digital ad set to strains of \"Pero Ya No\" \u2014 \"But Not Anymore\" \u2014 a global hit single from Bad Bunny's February album, \"YHLQMDLG.\" \u00a0 \"I loved you before, but not anymore / I liked you, but not anymore / I\u2005was\u2005for you, but\u2005not anymore / Hey, but not anymore, hey,\u2005but not anymore.\"\u00a0 Here's the ad: Biden campaign aides say the message is aimed at Latino voters who might have supported Mr. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, or supported him in the years since, but are unwilling to do so again. The ad features footage of the president's visit to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria \u2014 the site of him tossing rolls of paper towels to island residents still infuriates many Latinos nationwide as a patronizing and baldly political gesture. \u00a0 The new message is airing in Florida and Pennsylvania, two states with critical Puerto Rican voting blocs that have tipped the scales for Democratic candidates in the past. In Central Florida, Puerto Rican voters situated between Tampa and Orlando are particularly influential in local and statewide elections. In Pennsylvania, Democrats have spent the last several cycles mobilizing them along the \"222 corridor\" \u2014 a stretch that runs along a state highway from Bethlehem through northern neighborhoods of Philadelphia and south towards Lancaster. The region is a magnet for Puerto Ricans seeking manufacturing and farming jobs and a lower cost of living.\u00a0 In Arizona, the Biden team is airing a new 30-second television spot with music by Fernandez and his recent hit, \"Decepciones.\"\u00a0 Lyrics from the song deliver a message similar to Bad Bunny's:\u00a0\"I don't miss you anymore, you hurt me from time to time. \u2026 And if we're talking about disappointments, I think yours has been the most hurtful.\" \u00a0 Here's the ad: The music is juxtaposed against video of President Trump discussing U.S.-Mexico border security and his July 2015 comments about undocumented immigrants that he made on the day he launched his presidential bid.\u00a0 Fernandez is Mexican and his music is far more popular in Arizona, a state where the Latino population is dominated by multigenerational Mexican-American families and more recent immigrants. His father, Mexican \"ranchero\" star Vicente Fernandez, campaigned for Clinton in 2016 and appeared at rallies she held in western states. \u00a0 Ed O'Keefe is a senior White House and political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 President Trump's two middle children, Tiffany Trump and Eric Trump, were among a host of speakers who delivered marks on the second night of the Republican National Convention, with Tiffany Trump offering an indictment of the media and Eric Trump running down a list of Mr. Trump's accomplishments as part of their pitch to voters. The first to appear, Tiffany Trump, a recent graduate of Georgetown Law School, accused the press of seeking to silence diverse voices.\u00a0 \"If what you share does not fit into the narrative they seek to promote, then it is either ignored or deemed a 'lie,' regardless of the truth,\" she said.\u00a0 While Tiffany Trump focused her remarks on criticizing the media, Eric Trump touted Mr. Trump's agenda during his first term in office and praised the president for his judicial appointments, overhaul of the tax code with the GOP-controlled Congress and foreign policy accomplishments. Eric Trump sought to draw distinctions between his father and Joe Biden, calling the Democratic nominee \"a career politician who has never signed the front of a check and does not know the slightest thing about the American worker or the American business.\" While Eric Trump claimed Biden has \"pledged to defund the police and take way our cherished Second Amendment,\" a fact check from CBS News' political unit found his claims to be false, as\u00a0Biden\u00a0has\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0said he does\u00a0not support\u00a0defunding the police. He did tell liberal activist Ady Barkan that he supports redirecting some funding from police to things like mental health counseling and social services.\u00a0 Eric Trump also claimed \"Biden has pledged to stop border wall construction and give amnesty and healthcare to all illegal immigrants,\" a statement that is partially true. Biden pledged earlier this month there would \"not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration.\" And he has also said he plans to send Congress \"a bill to provide for a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.\"\u00a0 Each of the president's oldest children are addressing the Republican National Convention, with Donald Trump Jr. speaking Monday, on the first night of the four-day event, and Ivanka Trump introducing Mr. Trump on Thursday before he delivers his speech accepting the GOP presidential nomination. Adam Brewster and Alex Tin contributed reporting. Good evening I'm Tiffany Trump. Since speaking at the Republican Convention 4 years ago, so much has changed for the world, for our country, and for my family. Like so many students across the world, I graduated from law school during the pandemic. Our generation is unified in facing the future in uncertain times -- and many of us are considering what kind of country we want to live in. As a recent graduate, I can relate to so many of you who might be looking for a job. My father built a thriving economy once, and believe me, he will do it again. This election I urge each and every one of you to transcend political boundaries. This is a fight for freedom versus oppression, for opportunity versus stagnation, a fight to keep America true to America. I urge you to make your judgement based on results and not rhetoric. If you believe in criminal justice reform, there is only one president that passed the First Step Act. Giving people a second chance, a chance at life once again. And if you believe in expanding quality and affordable healthcare, only President Trump, my father, signed Right to Try into law, the Favored Nations clause, and other actions to lower drug prices and keep Americans from getting ripped off. People must recognize that our thoughts, opinions, and even the choice of who we vote for are being manipulated and invisibly coerced by the media and tech giants. If you tune into the media, you get one biased opinion or another. And if what you share does not fit into the narrative they seek to promote, then it is either ignored or deemed a \"lie,\" regardless of the truth. This manipulation of what information we receive impedes our freedoms. Rather than allowing Americans the right to form our own beliefs, this misinformation system keeps people mentally enslaved to the ideas they deem correct. This has fostered unnecessary fear and divisiveness amongst us. Why are so many in the media, in technology, even in our own government, so invested in promoting a biased and fabricated view? Ask yourselves why are we prevented from seeing certain information? Why is one viewpoint promoted while others are hidden? The answer is control -- and because division and controversy breeds profit. But what are the consequences when only one side of the story gets out or when only one viewpoint is acceptable? For our education system it meant sacrificing civil debate, by creating an atmosphere where students with contrary opinions are too afraid to speak. Many students find themselves suppressing their beliefs to fit into the acceptable groupthink. In short, our nation suffers by inhibiting our diversity of thought and inclusion of ideas. Working together, outside of our political comfort zones, will accomplish so much more. Some cynical politicians don't seem to believe in the miracle of America. I do.\u00a0 As Maximo Alvarez so eloquently put it on this stage last night, if freedom is lost in this country, \"there is nowhere else to go.\" Having hope is not weakness\u2026Believing in Miracles is a gift from God. Tonight, I want to tell you the uncensored truth of what we believe in: We believe in equality of opportunity. We believe in freedom of thought and expression. Think what you want. Seek out the truth. Learn from those with different opinions. Then freely, make your voice heard to the world. We believe in school choice, because a child's zip code in America should not determine their future. We believe in freedom of religion for all faiths. And we believe in the American spirit. A country founded on ideas, not identity. A country where our differences are embraced. And the only country where the word \"dream\" has been attached to it. Because in America, your life is yours to chart. So, if you are hearing these things and thinking to yourself, THAT is the kind of country I want to live in. Well, whether you realized it or not, you're a Trump supporter. I implore you to see beyond the fa\u00e7ade \u2014the masks \u2014 that so many other politicians employ. My father is the only person to challenge the establishment, the entrenched bureaucracy, big pharma, and media monopolies to ensure that American's constitutional freedoms are upheld, and that justice and truth prevail. My father does not run away from challenges -- even in the face of outright hatred -- because fighting for America is something he will sacrifice anything for. He dreams big dreams for our country -- and he is relentless at achieving them. You see, Make America Great Again is not a slogan for my father, it is what drives him to keep his promise of doing what is right for American citizens. The energy for change and opportunity is with us. God has blessed us with an unstoppable spirit. His Spirit\u2026The American Spirit. My dad has proven to be driven by that spirit! He has demonstrated his faith by his uncompromising heart and actions! My dad has made me believe that America can truly be great again! If you care about living your life without restraints, about rebelling against those who would suppress your voice, and building YOUR American Dream. Then the choice in this election is clear. A vote for my father, Donald J. Trump, is a vote to uphold our American ideals. Be true to yourself. And stay true to the Dream of America. Thank you and God bless you all. Good evening, America. When I stood on this Convention stage four years ago, no one fully understood the historic change that was about to take place. We could all feel it. Something was happening. A movement was forming just below the surface. The forgotten men and women, voiceless in Washington D.C., were preparing to rise up. Our movement followed the pattern of so many that came before us. First, we were ignored. Then we were laughed at. Then they fought us. And then \u2013 together \u2013 we won. From that moment forward, America came first. America started winning again. America became respected again. But with every movement, there is a counter-movement. In the view of the radical Democrats, America is the source of the world's problems. As a result, they believe the only path forward is to erase history and forget the past. They want to destroy the monuments of our forefathers. They want to disrespect our flag \u2013 burn the stars and stripes that represent patriotism and the American dream. They want to disrespect our National Anthem by taking a knee, while our armed forces lay down their lives every day to protect our freedom. They do not want the Pledge of Allegiance in our Schools. Many, do not want one nation under God. The Democrats want to defund, destroy, and disrespect our law enforcement. The Democrats want an America where your thoughts and opinions are censored when they do not align with their own. President Reagan said, \"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction\u2026 It must be fought for and protected.\" This is the fight that we are in right now -- and it is a fight that only my father can win. My father ran, not because he needed the job, but because he knew hardworking people across this great country were being left behind. The media mocked these patriots \u2013 and \"the flyover states\" in which they lived. They ignored the Trump flags. They ignored the millions of MAGA banners and barns painted in Red, White and Blue. The Silent Majority had no one fighting for them -- in either Party. Their so called leaders were bowing to China, bribing Iran, and spending more time worrying about how they were received by the elites in Paris \u2014 than how Americans would provide for their families in Pittsburgh. Our family lost friends but it only pushed us to fight harder. My father pledged to every American in every city, state and town: He Was Going to Make America Great Again. And so began \"The Great American Comeback.\" Almost immediately, taxes were slashed. Regulations were cut and the economy soared to new heights -- heights never seen before. Wages went through the roof. Unemployment reached historic lows, especially for Black Americans, Hispanic Americans and Women. Trade deals were ripped up and renegotiated \u2014 lights were turned back on in abandoned factories across our country. Trillions of dollars were repatriated back into the United States \u2014 which had been sitting in foreign lands for far too long. Once again America became the envy of the world. And with that renewed strength came leverage. The President demanded that our allies pay their fair share for the defense of the Western World. My father rebuilt the mighty American military \u2013 added new jets, aircraft carriers. He increased wages for our incredible men and women in uniform, and expanded the military defense budget to $721 billion per year. America was no longer weak in the eye of the enemy. The moment President Trump ordered special forces to kill some of the deadliest terrorists on the planet --- the day the mighty MOAB was dropped on insurgent camps --- is the day America took a stance to never be defeated by the enemy. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani? Dead! Over and over again. Issue after issue. The economy. The Wall. The Military. Trade deals. Tax cuts. Supreme Court Justices. VA Hospitals. Prescription drugs. School Choice. \"Right To Try.\" Moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Peace in the Middle East. Never-ending wars were finally ended. Promises made, and promises, for the first time, were kept. Most politicians spend their entire careers in Washington DC and get absolutely nothing accomplished. For example: Joe Biden. Joe Biden is a politician who has been in government for 47 years. He is a career politician who has never signed the front of a check and does not know the slightest thing about the American worker or the American business, the engine which fuels the greatest economy the world has ever known. The same politician who is a total pushover for Communist China and someone who would be a giant relief for the terrorists who've now spent years running, hiding, and being taken out by the most talented military known to man. Biden has pledged to raise your taxes by 4 trillion dollars, 82% of all Americans will see their taxes go up significantly. Biden has pledged to stop border wall construction and give amnesty and healthcare to all illegal immigrants. Biden has pledged to Defund the Police and take away our Cherished Second Amendment. My father on the other hand, delivered the largest tax cuts in American history, knows that if you do not have a border, you do not have a country, and will always support Law Enforcement and your Right to Keep and Bear Arms. \u00a0 Every day my father fights for the American people. The forgotten men and women of this country. The ones who embody the American Spirit, which is unlike anything else in the world. It built the New York City skyline, it built the Hoover Dam and soon, under my father's leadership, it will send Americans to Mars. The American Spirit can be felt in the majesty of the Grand Canyon, the shadow of Mt. Rushmore and in the stillness of the air at Gettysburg. It can be seen in the wide-eyed wonder of every American child as they take their first breath in the greatest Country the world has ever known. It defeated fascism and communism and in 68 days, it'll defeat the empty, oppressive, and radical views of the extreme left. Ronald Reagan's quote ends with this simple warning: \"One day we could spend our sunset years telling our children \u2026 what it was once like in, the United States, where men (and women) were free.\" Under President Trump, freedom will never be a thing of the past. That's what a vote for Donald Trump represents. It is a vote for the American spirit, the American dream and the American flag. To the Law Enforcement Officer who is being attacked, betrayed and whose job they are trying to make extinct, my father will fight for you. To all Houses of Worship and to all people of Faith, stripped of our religious freedoms and religious liberties, my father will fight for you. To the voiceless, shamed, censored and canceled, my father will fight for you. To our farmers who work dawn to dusk to keep our plates full, my father will too fight for you. To every single mother and father, to our veterans, our coal miners and to the American worker, my father will fight for you. And to every proud American who bleeds red, white and blue, my father will continue to fight for you. In closing, I'd like to speak directly to my father. I miss working alongside you every day but I'm damn proud to be on the front lines of this fight. I am proud of what you are doing for this country. I am proud to show my children what their grandfather is fighting for. I am proud to watch you give them hell. Never stop. Continue to be unapologetic. Keep fighting for what's right. You are making America strong again. You are making America safe again. You are making America proud again. And, yes, together with the forgotten men and women, who are finally forgotten no more, you are making America Great Again! Dad, let's make Uncle Robert proud. Let's go get another 4 years. I love you very much! God Bless You and God Bless the United States of America!",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, there are alarming new increases in the number of COVID cases around the world as President Trump struggles to get the country and his campaign back on track.\u00a0(Crowd shouting)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a scene we haven't witnessed in months, a large indoor gathering with thousands of supporters cheering President Trump, a campaign relaunch one Republican strategist said was much needed after a brutal few months. For the President, it was a way to get out of Washington and leave his troubles behind if only for a few hours. It's been a difficult week for Mister Trump. The Supreme Court ruled against his administration for attempting to stop a program protecting the children of undocumented immigrants from being deported. His former national security advisor John Bolton won a court case to allow a bombshell book to become public, it's a devastating look at a President trying to do just about anything to win reelection. Then the controversial firing of the federal prosecutor investigating Trump allies Rudy Giuliani and Michael Cohen. Most troubling that the number of new coronavirus cases in some states has spiked dramatically, but President Trump continues to downplay the virus.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Monday): So if we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any.\u00a0(Wednesday): It's fading away. It's going to fade away.\u00a0(Saturday): I said to my people, slow the testing down, please. They test and they test.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Is politics getting in the way of common sense? Restrictions in blue western states like California and Oregon have tightened in light of the increases, but many of the southern states that are Republican leaning have been slower to respond. We'll talk with a top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner. Plus, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. We'll get an update on coronavirus from former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb and talk with Jide Zeitlin, the CEO of Tapestry, a Fortune 500 company. Finally, we'll reflect on the Juneteenth anniversary, with New York Times opinion writer and CBS political analyst, Jamelle Bouie.\u00a0It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We've got a lot of news to get to today. We begin with CBS News' national correspondent Mark Strassmann in Atlanta.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0(Crowd cheering)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News National Correspondent): In Trump-friendly Oklahoma, the President reportedly seethed, his first reelection rally in months and, yet, this Tulsa arena was perhaps one-third empty. He had crowed that a million people wanted tickets. Mister Trump talked about America's continuing corona crisis.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Testing is a double-edged sword. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people, slow the testing down, please.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: He also characterized the pandemic with racist wordplay.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can name Kung flu. I can name nineteen different versions of names.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Local health officials had worried the rally could become a COVID super spreader, some Trump loyalists were willing to take the chance.\u00a0MAN #1: I am concerned about it especially with all of the spit maybe going up in the air as we cheer and stuff like that.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Before the event began, six members of the Trump campaign staff tested positive. All rally-goers had their temperatures checked, everyone received a face mask, but wearing it was optional.\u00a0MAN #2: No intentions on wearing masks. We're-- we're healthy individuals.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Inside, social distancing was ignored and as the President spoke, it appeared most of his audience was not wearing masks. That attitude alarms U.S. health officials. As America reopens, COVID-19's resurging, roughly thirty thousand more Americans tested positive over the last two days, close to the April peak. In twenty-one states, new COVID cases trend in a worrisome direction, up. Ten states this week broke seven-day averages for new cases. On Saturday Florida broke its daily record again. More than four thousand new cases. In an about-face, state health officials now urge Floridians to wear masks and avoid groups of more than fifty people. When New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he might start quarantining arriving Floridians, Florida's governor fired right back at Cuomo.\u00a0RON DESANTIS: Just please do not quarantine any Floridians in the nursing homes in New York.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: In both Arizona and Florida, Major League Baseball closed all spring training facilities. At least a dozen players have tested positive. The Mets and the Yankees are heading home to train where it's safer in New York. Pro football took another hit. The NFL Players Association advised its members to stop practicing together. America is COVID weary. We are eager to get back to work, we want life to feel normal again, and it is making us sick.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Here in Georgia, COVID setting the kind of records that no state wants. In per capita COVID deaths, America's top four counties are all here. Like much of America, in this phase of the virus, cities seem healthier. All four of those counties are rural. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann in Atlanta. Thanks.\u00a0We want to go now to the acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. He joins us from department headquarters here in Washington. Good morning to you.\u00a0CHAD WOLF (Acting Homeland Security Secretary/@DHS_Wolf): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot to get to with you, but I want to ask you about something the President said twice. He said that National Security Adviser John Bolton \"likes dropping bombs on people and killing them. Now he will have bombs dropped on him.\" If a private citizen said something like that, I-- I feel like there'd be some security concerns. What was the President trying to say? Is this a threat?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Well, Margaret, I'm going to let the President speak for himself. I did not have the chance to work closely with Ambassador Bolton before I came into this position. So I'm going to let the White House speak for-- for themselves. But I think what the President-- the frustration that he has with Ambassador Bolton is we all serve at the pleasure of the President. And if you disagree with the President, then you have the ability to resign. And that didn't occur in this case. As you know, Ambassador Bolton was fired. And so I think what you see here is some frustration on an individual writing a book for profit. And so I think that's-- that's what I take from those comments. But, again, I would refer you back to the White House.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Bombs dropped on him. You don't take that as concerning?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: No. I think-- again, I think if you listen to the President in a variety of different remarks, a lot of some of his comments are taking from a humor standpoint, a joking standpoint.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. I also want to ask about something else the President said last night. Are you aware of the President telling officials to slow down testing as it relates to coronavirus?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: No. Again, I heard those comments as well. I think that what you-- what you heard from the President was frustration, frustration in the sense of that we are testing, I believe we've tested over twenty-five million Americans. We've tested more than any other country in this world. Instead, the press and others, all they want to focus on is an increasing case count. And we know that that's going to occur when you test individuals more and more and more.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something that falls directly under your portfolio, and that is the TSA. Homeland Security has been ordered to open an investigation in regard to a whistleblower's accusations that there wasn't uniform guidance given to those individuals who are conducting searches at airports. There wasn't training or procedures on protective equipment to deal with COVID. That poses a risk not just to those officers, but, obviously, to the public that interacts with them.\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, no mandates for gloves to be changed, no thermometers for passenger temperature checks. Well, what's the status of the investigation?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Well, as you indicated, it's an open investigation, so I'm not going to comment specifically. But what I can tell you is that from day one, we have provided transportation security officers, those TSA officers at checkpoints, screening individuals, all of the guidance, all of the standards and all of the PPE that they need to do their job. So we'll continue to work with the investigation, but I feel very confident in what we have provided the TSAs. But I will tell you that as-- over--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that concern you, though? Or is it safe to fly at current levels?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Absolutely. Absolutely. It is safe to fly. I will tell you, though, over the course of three or four months, as this virus has continued to evolve and as the CDC's health strategies continued to evolve so has DHS operations. We have a number of front-line officers not only at airports, but on our borders, making sure that we are screening individuals as they come into this country. They can't social distance, as you indicated. And so they have to touch individuals. They have to make sure that individuals are resolved. But we'll continue to provide all of the PPE, all of the resources as we have since day one to all of our front-line officers.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: This week as-- as you well know the Supreme Court issued it-- its ruling and rejected the administration's attempt to cancel the DACA program. You said that decision doesn't provide a lot of clarity for the seven hundred thousand or so--\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --recipients on the program. Can you assure them that they will still get their work visas renewed, that they won't be forcibly deported from this country?SCHAD WOLF: Well, what I would tell you is that we know that the DACA program is unlawful. The Supreme Court even this week did not say that the program was lawful. And in fact, they said that the department has the ability to rescind the program. What they didn't like is the rationale in the way in which we propose to do that. And I-- I find that a little concerning because what we know is the Obama administration created this program out of thin air, did not provide notice and comment before the American public to comment on such a-- a monumental decision. Instead, the President and this administration has laid out a six-month phase-out program, been very upfront with the American people about how to do that. So we'll continue to take a look at that and-- and--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So what-- from- those work visas--\u00a0CHAD WOLF: --see how we go from day one.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --will continue to be renewed and there won't be forcible deportations. Is that what you're saying?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Absolutely. We'll continue the program as we have over the past two years, continuing to renew those. But the President's been very clear about wanting to find a lasting solution for these individuals. He's also directed the department to take a look at the court opinion and take a look at our rationale, and we're doing that as well so that we can, again, wind down this program. I think it's important to-- to remind your viewers this is an unlawful program. And as the acting secretary of Homeland Security--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It's an incredibly popular program, including with Republicans.\u00a0CHAD WOLF: I don't-- I don't disagree that it's popular, but I think you have to-- you have to separate those two. Is it popular and is it lawful? And as acting secretary, I don't have the luxury of ignoring the law and running a program that's unlawful. And so what the President's been very clear about is asking Congress to find a solution for these individuals.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That means a path to citizenship, one would assume. Just to button up on something you referred to earlier when you talked about the increase in testing that is available to those who-- who may have COVID-19. I'm sure you know that there are spikes in actual hospitalizations, people actually getting sick, particularly in Arizona and in Te-- in Texas. It's not just increased testing.\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Absolutely. And, again, the White House Coronavirus Task Force is on top of all of these outbreaks, looking state by state, county by county. Whether it's Arizona, Texas, Florida, a number of these states that are having hot spots, that are having those upticks. So we're surging resources, medical individuals and the like, even individuals from the Department of Homeland Security. We're surging into those to-- areas to understand what is the cause of that outbreak and address that proactively.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't know yet what the cause of the outbreaks in all of those Sun Belt States is?\u00a0CHAD WOLF: They're all different. They're all for various different reasons. What we see is some of the outbreaks along the southwest border in Arizona, particular parts of Texas, we have about 1.5 U.S.-- U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents living in Mexico, coming back over for medical treatment. So there's a variety of different reasons on why you would have different outbreaks in different states. And, again, we have medical professionals, CDC has sent teams into these individual areas, the Department has as well. And we're continuing to address that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Mister Secretary, thank you for your time this morning.\u00a0CHAD WOLF: Okay. Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: In Washington reporters have learned that a lot can happen on a Friday night when it comes to the Trump administration. This past Friday, Attorney General William Barr announced the resignation of Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. That office is investigating some of Mister Trump's allies, including Rudy Giuliani. Berman's response? He had no intention of resigning. Saturday, the attorney general went a step further, sending a letter to Berman saying I have asked the President to remove you as of today and he has done so. Berman then announced his departure effective immediately. President Trump had a different version of the firing.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have a very capable attorney general, so that's really up to him, I am not involved.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to White House correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, why was there this confusion and-- and why hasn't the attorney general explained why he did this?\u00a0PAULA REID (CBS News White House Correspondent/@PaulaReidCBS): Well, as you heard there, the President is saying he does not get involved in matters related to the Justice Department but his own attorney general, Margaret, has said that the President's prolific tweets on matters related to the Justice Department make it nearly impossible for him to do his job, the special counsel laid out eleven possible instances where the President has tried to obstruct justice by interfering at the Justice Department, which is why many people are seeing what happened Friday through a lens of skepticism and raising questions about whether the President is trying to protect himself or his allies like Rudy Giuliani, but Justice Department official says there was no connection between this firing and any ongoing investigation. But, so far, Margaret, the attorney general has not been able to explain why he gave that statement Friday saying Berman was stepping down when Berman said, wait not so fast.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and it-- it's also unusual because the southern district handles so many sensitive cases, including the one you just mentioned with the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Last night the President himself said he didn't know that.\u00a0PAULA REID: That was very--\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Fox News): I mean, not investigating me, and I don't even know about Giuliani being investigated, you are telling me that. I read that over the last day, but I don't know about Rudy Giuliani being investigated, investigated for what? He was the greatest crime fighter of our generation, of our time.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But Speaker Pelosi released a statement saying that the investigation into Rudy Giuliani was connected here. What do we know?\u00a0PAULA REID: Well, CBS News has learned that Giuliani has been under investigation by that office, for possible foreign lobbying violations related to his work in Ukraine. And last night, Margaret, Giuliani told a reporter that he believes these two events could be connected which are not helping the optics here. And one thing that's really significant is the Southern District of New York has always prided itself on being independent from Washington. And in his letter to Berman, the attorney general, specifically, said that now the internal watchdog, the inspector general at the Justice Department will now have an oversight role of that office, suggesting they are clearly no longer independent.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: There was other-- another key ruling from a court that said former national security advisor John Bolton can actually go ahead with the publication and sale of his book about his time at the Trump White House. But the judge didn't actually make it a clear win. The President is saying, it's actually in his favor.\u00a0PAULA REID: Well, as you noted, the judge said that Bolton's book can be released but he also accused Bolton of possibly damaging national security and exposing himself to civil and potentially criminal liability. Now, in this decision, the judge noted one of the reasons that he was going to allow the book to be published is that many reporters, including CBS News, had the book here at the White House while they were arguing about this. But the judge signaled that it's possible that Bolton may need to forfeit any profits. And, historically, judges have been pretty sympathetic to the government if they can establish that someone did not complete a review process, they may say, hey, you can release your book but you got to hand over the cash.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Paula Reid at the White House, thank you.\u00a0We turn now to the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. Good morning to you.\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia/@MarkWarner/Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know why U.S. Attorney Berman was fired?\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: I have absolutely no idea. Although we do see this pattern where the administration uses Friday night to announce bad news. But this is one more example of why I think Bill Barr has repeatedly demonstrated that he's more interested in being Donald Trump's personal lawyer than he is in being the attorney for the United States of America.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were a number of investigations that the Southern District was-- was, and I suppose are-- are still pursuing. And in his statements, Berman referred to the importance of continuing some of those investigations. Do you have any sense what he was referring to?\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: No, it has been speculated that the U.S. Attorney Mister Berman was investigating Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Mister Giuliani. I think a number of us have been worried that Mister Giuliani may have been knowingly or unknowingly manipulated by individuals coming out of Ukraine that may be manipulated by Russia. So there seems to be a pattern from this administration that the President and his henchman, Mister Barr, are willing to get rid of anyone that's investigating people that get close to Donald Trump.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, CBS has reported that Rudy Giuliani is under investigation. But do you have any reason to believe that the deputy in the Southern District office, her name is Audrey Strauss, is not capable or wouldn't pursue those investigations?\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: No, it-- it appears that she's a career professional, and I think it was appropriate for Mister Berman to push back against what I think was totally inappropriate firing by first Barr and then it appeared Donald Trump himself. But we've seen this pattern. I've seen it in the intelligence community where, literally, six Trump-appointed intelligence officials have either been pushed out or fired because they tried to do their job of speaking truth to power. It appears again that Mister Berman, who was a Trump appointee, was trying to do his job, follow the law, and that cost him his job. I-- I do believe his-- his deputy, Miss Strauss, though, should be able to do the job professionally and appropriately.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. You've been raising concerns about politicized intelligence. And I want to ask you what justification the Department of Justice has given you as to why the investigation your committee conducted into Russian election meddling in 2016 has not been released publicly, given that we are five months out from the election and this is one of the most key portions of your investigation.\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, our last volume, Volume V, close to a thousand pages, and I would point out again, we're the only bipartisan investigation that has been looking into this subject. We've been virtually unanimous in all our first four reports. Our Volume V, a thousand pages, has been submitted to the director of National Intelligence for final clearance review.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So the director of National Intelligence had publicly said he would look into having this released. But you believe John Ratcliffe, the director, is the one holding it up now?\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, I think it is an appropriate review process. We simply submitted it literally within the last thirty days. So I'll give the ODNI a little more time. But my hope and expectation is that this volume will be released so that Americans can make their judgment. And I want it released before the August recess.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about John Bolton, the former national security adviser to President Trump. We did see a federal judge rule that his book can be sold. But the judge also said he gambled with the national security of the United States by publishing information before the classification review had been completed. So that-- that's going to potentially give him some legal challenges. But from what you hear from the intel community, from the CIA director, is there a lot of concern about what Bolton disclosed?\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, I think John Bolton, if he wanted to tell his story and he has such damning accusations against Donald Trump, not only vis-a-vis Ukraine, but in terms of the President's activities with Erdogan, the Turkish leader, with the President's activities and allegations about his conversations with President Xi of China. If John Bolton had really wanted to get this information out for reasons other than his own personal profit, he should have come and testified before the House or the Senate\u2014\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to ask him to testify now--\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: --much earlier in the year.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --with your Republican colleagues?\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, I'm not sure that his credibility at this moment is all that high. But I think the bigger argument here, if these allegations and accusations, which are extraordinarily damning, are true, I would think my Republican colleagues would want to have that-- get him on, get him under oath as well.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's maybe it sounds like. On the intell-\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: That's a maybe at this point. But, again, I don't think-- I think John Bolton managed to not only-- he managed to unite all of Washington. The Democrats were frustrated.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: He was not--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But you--\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: --willing to testify. The Republicans are, obviously, concerned about the book. But, you know, at the end of the day--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you didn't-- you didn't answer the first question, though.\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: --we need to figure out whether these allegations are true or not.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you just didn't-- just to button up, you didn't answer the question of how concerned the intelligence community truly is about what was revealed.\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: Again, I'm not going to speak to what-- I think the intelligence community is-- is always concerned about leaking of classified information. I think there is a legitimate question here whether what Bolton is laying out, though, is this classified because of Donald Trump is afraid of the substance or because of legitimate intelligence reasons.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Senator, thank you for your time.\u00a0SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: In two weeks we will talk to former national security advisor John Bolton about his bombshell book, The Room Where It Happened. That's Sunday, July the fifth.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb and a whole lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. The total number of COVID-19 cases worldwide now stands at 8.8 million, and the World Health Organization warns that the pandemic is accelerating, particularly, in the Americas. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports from London. Liz.\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@elizapalmer): Margaret, here in Europe, things have really turned around, coronavirus, at least for now, is in retreat.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: Borders are even reopening so people can travel to vacation spots. But in the developing world, the pandemic is raging. Brazil is in full-blown crisis. As in the U.S., COVID-19 here has become political. On Copacabana Beach a pandemic denier knocked down crosses at a symbolic memorial.\u00a0(Man speaking foreign language)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: But arguing can't hide the facts. Fifty thousand new cases a day here, and the coronavirus peak is still weeks away. Nearby, in Peru, they are selling oxygen in the streets. The infection rate has come down a little but left many families treating COVID victims at home because hospitals are too full or too expensive. This is still a dangerous time warned WHO Director General Tedros Ghebreyesus.\u00a0TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS: Many people are understandably fed up with being at home. Countries are understandably eager to open up their societies and economies, but the virus is still spreading fast.\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: In India's capital, Delhi, they learned that the hard way. Shops, offices and markets reopened two weeks ago and the virus took off. Now with hospitals overwhelmed the city is converting train carriages into makeshift COVID wards. They'll offer a bed of sorts and oxygen, but not a chance of social distancing. Russia too lifted its strict lockdown and even staged rehearsals for the traditional Victory Day parade. Lots of hardware, very few masks. The Kremlin insists in spite of widespread skepticism that the virus is under control, but then announced that anyone meeting President Putin will first have to go through one of these disinfection machines. And in St. Petersburg, a makeshift memorial put faces to the names of the almost five hundred doctors and nurses who have died fighting coronavirus.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: Here in the U.K., the government is hinting that it's about to relax the social distancing rule from six feet to three. The hope is it will help hotels and restaurants, if not thrive, at least survive. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz Palmer, thank you.\u00a0We turn now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who is in Westport, Connecticut, this morning. Good morning to you, Doctor Gottlieb.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We heard that the number of COVID-19 cases has exceeded thirty thousand a day for the first time in about seven weeks. What is happening?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, we're seeing a resurgence in the South and in the Southeast. They never really got rid of their epidemics. Now, we're seeing significant outbreaks on top of a background rate of spread that was quite high. As they reopened, that spread has continued to increase. And so, you know, a challenge that was facing some regions of the country now is facing every region in the country. And the-- the worry is that they're going to tip over into exponential growth coming this week because the cases are building quite quickly in Texas, Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Arizona. And the challenge with exponential growth is everything looks okay until suddenly it doesn't. And so this is something that has to be a concern of everyone that's been watching this.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say exponential growth, are you saying that hospitals are about to get overwhelmed in places like Arizona and Texas?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's the concern. So if you look at places like Arizona, the hospitals now are getting pressed. Midweek, there was a report out of Arizona that about forty percent of the hospital beds were filled with COVID patients. Texas and Florida still reporting a lot of capacity even though Florida doesn't report the total hospitalizations for COVID patients. But these things can mount very quickly, as we saw in New York. You're always when-- when the epidemic is expanding, it's always worse than what you're measuring. And so there are a lot more cases in these states that are going to get turned over this coming week. Given the rate of growth that we've seen, we know that there's community spread now underway in states like Florida, Texas, California, for that matter, too, and Arizona. Those are big states that have a lot of cases they've been building. And so this is going to be hard to get under control. We're not going to want to shut down businesses again. We're not going to want to shut down the economy. So, there's not many tools we can reach for. We can do case-based interventions, the tracking and the tracing of sick people to get people isolated. We can go towards universal masking, something that's been controversial in some of these states, but there's not much-- much else you can do. And so there's no quick intervention that's going to bring this to an end.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: In Arizona, it was just this week that the governor gave mayors the power to make masks mandatory. They're not doing that in Florida. They're not doing that in Texas. Is that a-- a mistake?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think they're going to have to. I think it's a mistake they're not doing. Now they're losing precious time. I think they're going to have to. The masking has become controversial. It shouldn't be. It's a simple intervention. It's a collective action we can all take to help protect our fellow citizens, and also protect ourselves and try to reopen the economy safely. I think some people see it as a sort of infringement on their liberty or as a way as-- to cast some scorn on a public health establishment that's come in for some questions because people blame the public health establishment for the shutdowns. They blame the public health establishment for some conflicting guidance. I think in other quarters it's been portrayed as something that, you know, Trump supporters don't want to wear masks. It's neither of those things. It's something that we can do collectively to try to reduce the spread. It's really all we have and it's not-- it's not a very robust tool at that. But it's a tool that we have and it's a tool that's been demonstrated to have an impact if everyone does it or if most people do it.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, health officials did give conflicting messages on wearing masks in the first place, but we now know--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --from Doctor Fauci it's because they were afraid of shortages.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And also worried that by telling people they could wear masks you're telling them they can go out. So at a time that they were telling people to stay at home, there was concern that telling them that if they wear masks, they're more safe will encourage people to go out. And so--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --I think that could have been messaged appropriately. They didn't need to be concerned about that. We should have been recommending masks from the outset.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We heard from the secretary of Homeland Security earlier in the program, and he said the press and others only want to talk and focus on the increased case count and that testing is a good message. The President says testing is overrated. What is the bottom line, the science and the facts about where we are with this virus in America right now?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, testing-- there's a high correlation between places that are doing more testing, more contact tracing, and have decreased mobility and have better-- a better picture right now. Some of the cases that we're collecting are because we're testing more. But the positivity rate is also going up in states like Texas where it's about eight percent, Florida about eight percent, Arizona almost twenty percent. We're seeing the positivity rates go up. That's a clear indication that there's now community spread underway. And this isn't just a function of testing more. So, some of it is testing more. We're probably capturing right now somewhere between one in five to one in ten infections. Before during the epidemic, we were probably measuring one in ten to one in twenty infections. So we're capturing a higher percentage of the overall infections, but the infections are also going up. So, this is an epidemic that's expanding in these states. And the challenge is there's not a clear endpoint. We're becoming more and more dependent upon a therapeutic intervention early in the fall to be our backstop because we're taking a lot of virus through this summer. We really shouldn't be where we are in June right now. It's not clear what's going to improve the picture in July and August if we're not going to start to impose additional mitigation, start closing bars and restaurants. And states aren't going to want to do that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: They're going to be slow to do that. So, these case counts are going to build.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And many of these states we're talking about are not doing those things you're recommending. I want to ask you, though, about what some of the businesses are doing because it was businesses who kind of led the way in shutting down in the first place. Apple shuttered stores in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina due to outbreaks. Every team in Major League Baseball is going to shut their-- their camps due to this. Are corporations going to have to lead the way this time, as well?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, corporations led the way last time, I think--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it on the business owner to shut-- shut it down, in other words? Is the restaurant owner responsible for making that decision--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah. I--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --and not the state? Not the mayor?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's what happened last time. The states and the local school districts really forced the-- the hand of policymakers on shutting down the economy. I think what you're going to see is businesses that are national in scope are going to close stores regionally. And that's what we saw with Apple. We saw-- saw with another business today in Florida. I think school districts right now are contemplating how they reopen, and some of them might make decisions not to reopen what-- looking at all these trends in these states. It's going to be harder for them to lock into plans. I think they should try to reopen in the fall. But if there's a lot of virus still in July and August, it's going to be very hard for them to reopen these schools. So if we want to reopen the schools, we've got to get this under control. We-- we might have to take a little bit of economic pain right now to get this under better control in these states to open up the opportunity to open schools in the fall, which is going to have a big economic benefit because parents can't go back to work in earnest--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --unless the kids are in school.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely. Good point. Thank you very much, Doctor Gottlieb. Always good to talk to you.\u00a0Be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to the island of Kauai in Hawaii, where CEO Jide Zeitlin is this morning. He's the head of a Fortune 500 company called Tapestry Incorporated. You know them as the parent company of luxury fashion brands Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman. Good morning.\u00a0JIDE ZEITLIN (Tapestry Inc., CEO): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know this week we saw from the Commerce Department this announcement that consumers were spending in May. Retail sales numbers were better than expected. I'm-- I'm wondering what you think is happening with consumers right now.\u00a0JIDE ZEITLIN: What we see, and we see this around our global businesses, that consumers have remained engaged. Even during a period where all of our brick-and-mortar stores were closed, they were very engaged digitally with our brands, with our products. And now, as they have the opportunity to engage in a physical way, we see them doing so and doing so enthusiastically. Although it's-- it's a slow step-by-step process. So it's not just a return to where things were, but the opportunity to engage physically and digitally is something that we see consumers being enthusiastic to do.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're reopening a number of your businesses not just in this country, but also in China, which continues to see these flare-ups of COVID-19. I wonder how you're dealing with that sort of start-stop, flare up, pull back. Do you go ahead and rehire people to actually work in stores, or are those jobs going to come back at all?\u00a0JIDE ZEITLIN: Well, we held on longer than most of our peers, and so we did not furlough or lay off employees for quite some time globally and-- and particularly here in North America. But what we have seen is that we went from fully shut in Asia to today in China being fully opened, in South Korea being fully opened. And that has stayed steady. At the same time, in North America we're gradually opening, but really taking the lead from our store employees, from our consumers, so that we look to avoid both start and stop, but also want to make sure we do it in a way that makes the most sense for our employees.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But the jobs are coming back, you think? It's not all going to be online shopping from here on out?\u00a0JIDE ZEITLIN: Without a doubt, Margaret, at least in our-- in our case.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0JIDE ZEITLIN: We think the consumer is really moving towards a balance, a blend, between digital and physical.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, we-- we talked about you being the head of one of Fortune 500 companies, one of the largest corporations in the world, that means. And you are one of only four African-Americans in-- in that list. There are zero black women on that list among the thirty-seven female leaders. And I wonder what you think the reason is. Why at the highest levels is diversity still a challenge?\u00a0JIDE ZEITLIN: Yeah, it's an unfortunate reality, and it's a real opportunity. And it's an opportunity really for boards and for managements to challenge themselves, to really challenge themselves in terms of both diversity and inclusivity. So you focused in terms of statistics on diversity, and it's clear that we need to better recognize that it's not simply a nice thing, it's a real business imperative to have a diverse number of views around the table. The more you have different life perspectives, different experiences around the table, we develop better products, we develop better solutions as corporations. And it's one of America's great strengths if we get it right. So it's really holding ourselves much more accountable, the same way we hold ourselves accountable for revenue and profit targets to make sure that we are diverse. And then to meet that diversity with a really inclusive environment, one that encourages people to show up fully at work as themselves.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but how does-- corporations are having to make these decisions on their own. What's the best way to do these things? Is it setting quotas? Is it hiring headhunters and talent scouts to bring in people from the inside? How do you put this into practice?\u00a0JIDE ZEITLIN: It's holding ourselves accountable for goals in the same way we hold ourselves accountable for revenue and profit metrics. And it is fundamentally believing that this is a business imperative. You know I noted last week that you had Rob Kaplan on your show, and he made the comment representing the Federal Reserve, the belief that inclusively translates into greater workforce growth, greater productivity growth, and greater economic growth. And so we exist within an ecosystem, within an economic ecosystem. The faster that ecosystem is growing because it is more diverse and inclusive, the faster we will grow. So it's a real imperative, and we need to hold ourselves accountable the same way we do against other business metrics.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you say business metrics, that means setting quotas? Because I-- I read that you had said, \"Diversity by itself doesn't mean a lot until you change the culture of your organization.\" Those seem like two different things.\u00a0JIDE ZEITLIN: They are two different things. So it is goals as I-- as I think about it. So being very clear that our workforce ought to be-- ought to look like the American demographic. And-- and it's not setting goals that are five or ten years out. It's setting goals that are quite immediate, in the same way as my board holds me accountable for revenue and profit metrics, not five and ten years out, but this year and next year. That is the diversity piece of it. And then on the inclusivity piece, it's recognizing that you don't change your culture so that if a more diverse workforce comes and they find themselves living in a 1950s culture and in a culture that is not representative of where America is today, you won't keep your people. You won't motivate your people. You won't get the best out of your people. So it's having a culture that-- or-- or being more inclusive that-- that actually encourages people to fully show up as themselves.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Jide, thank you very much for your time and your reflections.\u00a0JIDE ZEITLIN: Thank you, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Americans across the country honored Juneteenth as a day of reflection and in some cases celebration this past Friday. It is meant to commemorate June 19th, 1865, the day slaves in Galveston, Texas, learned they were free and the civil war was over. Some states in U.S. corporations have newly designated it a paid holiday. New York Times columnist and CBS News political analyst Jamelle Bouie joins us from Charlottesville, Virginia, this morning to give us some more context. Good morning.\u00a0JAMELLE BOUIE (CBS News Political Analyst/@jbouie): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, many Americans are really learning about the historical significance of Juneteenth for the first time, and you reflected on it in a column this week. But you say you don't think of it as slaves having been granted freedom, but rather seizing it for themselves. What do you mean by that?\u00a0JAMELLE BOUIE: The story of emancipation, going really back to the founding of the country all the way to the Civil War is very much the story of enslaved Africans and-- and freed blacks taking the initiative to put their freedom on the agenda of national politics. That's especially true during the Civil War. The war, as many people know, it does not begin as a war for abolition. It begins as a war for Union. But as soon as the shooting starts, enslaved people are escaping to Union lines. They're leaving work on plantations. They're offering their assistance to-- to Union soldiers as guides, as laborers and, eventually, as soldiers. And it's those actions that transform the war for Union into a war for liberation, into a war for emancipation. And although Juneteenth commemorates those enslaved Africans who were whisked away to Texas to avoid the-- the Emancipation Proclamation, I think it's still an opportunity for us to really think and take seriously the fact that emancipation does not happen without the actions of the enslaved, not just over the war, but really over the course of eighty years.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're finding some resonance in that in the moment we're in today?\u00a0JAMELLE BOUIE: That's right. I think why this moment? Why Juneteenth has sort of erupted in this way over the past couple of weeks, why people find it so resonant right now is that Juneteenth is very much a holiday about the distance between freedom that is promised and freedom that is lived. And right now, millions of Americans are seeing with regards to the police brutality, with regards to inequality, the distance that still exists between freedom and liberty, as we imagine it, as we have proclaimed it, and that has actually experienced by ordinary people.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Texas Senator John Cornyn and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee are talking about trying to make it a federal holiday. You have a lot of corporations acknowledging it, some giving the day off as well now. But you kind of said that doesn't sit quite right with you. You see it as a little bit opportunistic.\u00a0JAMELLE BOUIE: Right. It's-- no one's going to complain about a paid holiday, right? Like everyone likes paid holidays. But when-- when-- when we think about what protesters are calling for, when we think about what, you know, actualizing freedom actually means, I-- I happen to think that a-- a more fitting tribute to Juneteenth would be policies that assist not just African Americans, but every American to help them reach their full potential, help them, again, actualize their freedom in a real way. That, to me, is what the holiday is about. It's about that distance and what we can do to close that distance.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You're speaking to us from Charlottesville, Virginia. And I don't have to tell you, but to remind our audience, that was the location in 2017 for what became a fatal white supremacist rally. And it-- it was sparked originally by the statue of Robert E. Lee and the--\u00a0JAMELLE BOUIE: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --debate over whether to remove that symbol of the Confederacy. Fast forward to today. I mean this week we had the governor of Virginia talk about taking down Lee in the capital of the Confederacy. Isn't that progress?\u00a0JAMELLE BOUIE: I-- I think that's progress. I think that represents Americans coming to recognize what those statues were erected for. They weren't erected as memorials after the war. They were very much erected as symbols of Jim Crow, as symbols of white supremacy. I think it's the public beginning to come to the recognition that public space is ours to shape. Right? That when we put up memorials or monuments, we are trying to present a particular memory--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0JAMELLE BOUIE: --of the past that we want to remember. And do we want to remember, honor a past where someone like Robert E. Lee was a central figure, a figure of esteem?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0JAMELLE BOUIE: I don't think we do. I don't think millions of Americans want to. And so that is, I think, what we're seeing and--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0JAMELLE BOUIE: --and it does constitute progress.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Jamelle, thank you.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Former national security advisor John Bolton is the subject of considerable criticism from the Trump White House in light of his new book. Yesterday, President Trump said he had been upset with Bolton since the beginning, starting with an appearance right here on FACE THE NATION more than two years ago. Let's listen.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Fox News): He was being interviewed on to FACE THE NATION, one of your friendly shows, and he talked about the Libyan model on Kim Jong-un, who I have a very good relationship with and had a very good relationship with. Once he mentioned that, it was not a good situation. I said, \"How stupid can you be?\" Because you know what happened to Qaddafi. Nobody wants to die the way he died. And here's a guy saying we like the Libyan model. And all I could do is hope that they didn't see it, but they did see it. It was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen on television, frankly. So he lost me.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course, we call our broadcast FACE THE NATION. And we will be talking to John Bolton again in two weeks on July 5th.\u00a0But that is going to do it for us today. We want to wish all of the dads out there watching a happy Father's Day. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0\u00a0",

She tells Morell what lessons were learned about deterring Russia during the 2018 midterm elections and how the Cybersecurity Directorate seeks to help the public and private sectors defend themselves against foreign cyber threats. She also explains why the NSA is looking to shed some of its secretive reputation, and adjust to a rapidly changing technological environment.\u00a0 HIGHLIGHTS Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. \u00a0Intelligence Matters: Anne Neuberger Producer: Olivia Gazis MICHAEL MORELL: Anne, welcome to Intelligence Matters. It is great to have you on the show. ANNE NEUBERGER: It's great to be here, thank you. MICHAEL MORELL: So I think the place to start, Anne, is with your career. Before you joined the National Security Agency, you had a career in the private sector. Can you tell us about that and tell us what you did in the private sector and then what drew you into government service? ANNE NEUBERGER: Sure, absolutely. So I was running technology at a at a financial services company, and during that time period when financial services companies really moved off mainframe environments to the Web and to client server technology. So that piece of both taking in operations and a mission, and its associated technology and people and culture, really shaped the way I approach a lot of those problems today.\u00a0 And I was raised in in a family where my dad came as a refugee; all my grandparents came as refugees to the U.S., and they just constantly instilled in us how grateful we should be for the opportunity to be born in America and raised in America with its freedoms, with its ability to pursue one's dreams and and that we owed a debt for that.\u00a0 And I was driving home from work in 2006. We had just done a large acquisition of a company, of a bank's custodian operations. And on the radio, they were talking about the bombing of a mosque, Samarra mosque in Samarra, Iraq, and just the soldiers dying, civilians dying and the troubles there. And I still don't know why, but I thought of my dad and thought to myself, 'Perhaps now's the time to repay a little bit of of that debt in some way.'\u00a0 And, when I'd been a graduate student at Columbia, I had a I had a professor tell me about the White House Fellows program and encouraged me to apply. And I have to admit that, with a bit of the New Yorker, 'I can't leave New York, ever,' kind of put that aside. And for whatever reason, I just felt that calling at that moment, called him, and said, 'I'll apply.'\u00a0 And, fast forward, I was assigned to the Pentagon with zero military background and, you know, learned a lot about the culture, felt very drawn to that shared commitment. And so I spent a year in the Pentagon and worked for the Navy and then came to the NSA a couple of years later. MICHAEL MORELL: What did they have you doing at the Pentagon and the Navy? ANNE NEUBERGER: I was the Deputy Chief Management Officer at the Navy. So, essentially the Navy had a number of broad enterprise-wide technology efforts, which they were working to again, bring that people-mission-technology triangle together.\u00a0 And they asked me to help work on a couple \u2013 working directly for the Secretary of the Navy \u2013 figure out why a couple of them were struggling and then help them get on track. So I worked on that. And, you know, I often get asked by people, 'How did you end up at NSA?' It was a pretty funny story in that I had a seven- and six-year-old and I was commuting from Baltimore and the work-life balance was a bit tough.\u00a0 And I met somebody and he asked me about how I was doing. And I commented that I really loved the work, but it was a little hard for me to do the juggle. And he said, 'I happen to know that the NSA is standing up \u2013 the Director of NSA is standing up Cyber Command, and I know they need people with your kind of a background. So how about if I make a phone call there?'\u00a0 And I went for an interview, my commute was 30 minutes. And it sounds so foolish, but that was pretty much what it took. MICHAEL MORELL: Interesting. So the private sector and then the Department of Defense, which is, as you know, this huge enterprise, and then NSA and \u2013 this is not an easy question, I know, but: the similarities and differences of those three different experiences? ANNE NEUBERGER: It all begins with people. In every organization, missions have to adapt and change. They adapt and change in the private sector because perhaps you have a competitor, perhaps the customer space has adapted. Certainly financial services saw that, where the scale of data was just increasing, the scale of trades was increasing, and the traditional manual processes couldn't keep up. So we knew automation was needed to just reduce errors and help us keep on track with where trading was going. Technology could deliver on that, but the business of the organization had to change to fully take advantage of the technology. And the way people did that mission and use technology had to change along the way.\u00a0 So I think in each of those organizations, it taught me that that triangle has to be kind of guided together to get to an outcome.\u00a0 Mission, technology, and people. If you really want to be able to fully \u2013 whether it's take advantage of a market or stay ahead of an adversary in our own mission here in the IC or DOD \u2013 that triangle has to work together and you have to communicate those three planes together when talking about why the change is needed.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So Anne, in your tenure at NSA, you've served as its first Chief Risk Officer, the Assistant Deputy Director of Operations, the head of the Russia Small Group, and now the head of the Cybersecurity Directorate. Can you take us through your trajectory there? How did your responsibilities differ from role to role? ANNE NEUBERGER: Absolutely. So I came in to NSA on a small team, part of a small team that was standing up Cyber Command. The chief risk officer role was created after the media leaks period of 2013 where we learned that really appreciating risk meant looking at that in a holistic way, across partnership risk, operational risk, technology risk. And we learned that we needed to adapt the way we looked at risk and then change according to that. So I think in each of those roles, either the adversary was changing around us, the threat was changing around us, or, internally, we wanted to take advantage fully of an opportunity. And I was responsible for taking the big-picture strategic goals and translating those to measurable outcomes and objectives, and communicate the why and then bringing a team of people along to get there. And each of those efforts was a bit different, but in each of those we talked about the risk of doing and the risk of not-doing, weighing that appropriately. We talked about ensuring that, as we approached new missions, policy and technology move together. And certainly when we looked at the elections work in 2018, the Russia Small Group work, we saw where adversaries have used influence operations since the time of Adam and Eve, but perhaps what had changed was, again, the ability to use social media to both focus and direct it to have larger impact. MICHAEL MORELL: So focusing on the Russia Small Group for just a second, Anne. What was that? What was the mission and what were your responsibilities with regard to the 2018 elections \u2013 to the extent that you can talk about that? ANNE NEUBERGER: Absolutely. So the mission was ensuring the integrity of the 2018 midterm elections: ensuring that we, first, understood the threat. Second, that we appropriately tipped all the information we had about that threat to key partners across the U.S. government, certainly the FBI, from a counter-influence perspective, DHS from a cybersecurity of elections infrastructure perspective, and then, finally, that we would support Cyber Command, if authorized, to impose costs, if there were attempts to disrupt the election. MICHAEL MORELL: So after the 2018 elections, President Trump publicly confirmed that Cyber Command played a role in deterring the Russians in 2018. Are there important lessons from what happened in 2018 about how we as a country can defend ourselves against this insidious threat? ANNE NEUBERGER: Yes. So, you know, across the government, we look at two key poles of election integrity. One is, attempts to malignly influence the population, whether that is to highlight social discord, to highlight issues that divide the population or to, you know, share information as part of shaping individuals' ideas. And then the second is potentially interfering, hacking into elections infrastructure as part of efforts to change the vote.\u00a0 And I think the first piece is the value of resiliency: the sense that, once trust is lost, it's very hard to regain. So the knowledge for the American public that there are hundreds of people across the U.S. government committed to and working to ensure the integrity of those elections, of our elections.\u00a0 When it comes to counter-influence, though, the biggest resilience is each of us as Americans. When we're reading something, asking, 'Who might be trying to influence me, what is the source of that information? Am I fully confident in that source of that information?'\u00a0 And then, finally, the role of technology and the role of public private partnership as part of elections integrity. So for us in the intelligence community, we're constantly watching for which adversaries may be seeking to shape a population's thinking, to shape an election and then rapidly to bring that to partners or to the private sector to ensure that they're both aware of techniques and are countering them on their platforms. MICHAEL MORELL: So we've since learned, in fact, last week in updates from the DNI that the Russians continue to engage in election interference; the Chinese, the Iranians. And the punchline of all that for me is, it's really hard to deter foreign interference, right. And I'm wondering if it's something special about foreign interference or if it's more about cyber at the end of the day? And the difficulty of seeing cyber, attributing it if you see it. How do you think about that question? ANNE NEUBERGER: Absolutely. I think it is more about cyber than about elections. From a cyber perspective, when we look at fully both protecting cyber infrastructure, and then to your second point about attribution, there's complexity in laying what we call 'the red' on top of that.\u00a0 We may see threats that are talked about at a strategic perspective, and then we and partners across the US government are looking to see, 'Where does that present itself? Where are the given vulnerabilities in a given infrastructure?'\u00a0 The power is when you can lay the two together and say, 'Here is a nation state that has intent to interfere' \u2013 in whatever that is, in election critical infrastructure, IP theft \u2013 and then translate that to the tactical level to say, that network scanning or that vulnerability in hardware or software that we see out there may well be used to achieve the objective \u2013 putting that in place and then, most importantly, preventing it. Because at the end of the day, writing a report about a victim and notifying the victim is far less satisfying than being able to put that together and prevent the adversary achieving their objective. MICHAEL MORELL: So we've already started to shift now into your new role, right, which was relaunched in October, I believe. It would be great if you could, Anne, if you could explain for our listeners first, what NSA's two main missions are \u2013 SIGINT and then cybersecurity \u2013 and the difference between them just to give some folks here a level set. ANNE NEUBERGER: Absolutely. So, NSA is a foreign intelligence agency. We're responsible for understanding a broad range of threats presented by foreign governments to the United States.\u00a0 One of those threats include our cyber threats: how nations may be using cyber to achieve their national objectives. As I said, that might be intellectual property theft, for example, to counter the Department of Defense's lethality by accelerating a foreign government's ability to actually productize particular R&D for a weapon; that may be targeting critical infrastructure of a country as part of threatening tat country or as part of putting pressure on a given country. So that is the threat information.\u00a0 On the second side. NSA has a cybersecurity mission where \u2013 it's less well known. We build the keys, codes and cryptography that's used to protect all of US government's most sensitive communications: thinking nuclear command and control weapon systems, the president's communications with allies. And we provide technical advice to mitigate those same threats that I talked about.\u00a0 So the key integration of the two missions is where we think the magic is, where we can say 'Here's what we think adversaries are seeking to do, and here's how, from a cybersecurity perspective, we recommend you protect against that.' MICHAEL MORELL: So what motivated, Anne, the relaunch of the directorate and has its mission changed at all? ANNE NEUBERGER: Really good question. So we recognized that we were at a crossroad with national security as both technology and society shifts were happening. We saw all new kinds of technology that people wanted to use, from small satellites to Internet of Things. And each of those presents huge advancements, but they also present cyber security risk.\u00a0 Along with that, we saw various nation-states to use new technologies \u2013 think North Korea and cryptocurrency to get around sanctions to achieve their own objectives. And we said, 'We really need to up our game' to more quickly be understanding those threats and ensuring that we could both provide advice to build new technologies as securely as possible, but also to counter adversaries' use of those same technologies to achieve their national security goals. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Anne, what are the primary areas of focus for your directorate? What kind of people work there? What's their skill set? And what kind of customers do you serve? ANNE NEUBERGER: Yep, great question. So the first part is operationalizing intelligence: how do we ensure that, from the intelligence that we see, we tip anything that's unique, actionable and timely quickly so that we can prevent the victim? So that's the first piece of work.\u00a0 Our areas of focus are both understanding that, giving guidance. Encryption.\u00a0 We believe encryption is a key protection, particularly in a telecommunications environment that, in many cases is untrusted. So both in building the government's special encryption, modernizing that, as well as providing advice and insights on how to best use encryption.\u00a0 The types of people who work here are, like we see in many organizations, a broad gamut. We have intelligence analysts, we have country-specific experts, we have a broad swath of technical experts, encryption network technologies, hardware and software vulnerability analysts as well.\u00a0 But the power is where that can be integrated, where you can say, 'How do you build on a road of trust all the way through to an end point?' How do you properly defend a network and take a step back and do a risk analysis to say, 'Where are the gaps in your resilience and where should your next dollar of investment be to close those gaps?' MICHAEL MORELL: And then what about customers? Is it just the Department of Defense? Is that the U.S. government? Is it even broader than that? How do you think about who it is you're working for? ANNE NEUBERGER: Yeah, great question. So there's a specific set of work we do for what we call national security systems, systems carrying classified information, national security information. The director of NSA is also the national manager for national security systems. So that's the authority under which, as I mentioned, we build the keys, codes and cryptography and we're responsible for distributing threat information as well. So those are across the U.S. government with a particular focus on DOD. weapons systems and related systems.\u00a0 A second set of key partners and customers are certainly DHS, FBI. DHS in its role supporting critical infrastructure and the sector-specific agencies. And like I said, the real magic of understanding the critical infrastructure, where its key gaps and vulnerabilities are and being able to marry that up with what a foreign government may be intending to do and providing focused insight.\u00a0 Across the U.S. government, there is broad use of commercial technologies, particularly DOD and national security systems. So you may have seen, when we're issuing advisories, we're also issuing advice on how to secure and configure those commercial technologies well, because we see that those are used all across sensitive systems as well. MICHAEL MORELL: So Anne, your directorate has issued, I think, a dozen or so advisories about cybersecurity threats. Can you talk about why you guys do that, what the criteria is for putting one of those out? And then, how do you think about the impact they have? Do you keep metrics on that? How do you think about advisories? ANNE NEUBERGER: Absolutely. So our advisories \u2013 we really do them for three reasons. One is, if we see a nation-state actor using a particular vulnerability against a system we care about, we find that it really drives urgency of action. People run faster when they're pursued. And if we can say, 'This nation state actor is using this vulnerability, here's the mitigation advice to protect yourself against that,' we see impact, and I'll talk about that, how we measure that impact at the end.\u00a0 The second thing is, you know, there's a deep expertise here because we build and we break encryption. So encryption-related technologies like VPNs like, you may recall, the Windows 10 cryptographic vulnerability in January, those are areas we focus on because we know those are sometimes hard to understand, technically hard to implement. So if we can give very practical advice, then we'll issue those as well to help that be put in place.\u00a0 And then the third would be where there is a timely need, and we're getting a lot of questions and we feel that putting out a product helps guide people in thinking about how to think about security. I'll give an example: As COVID pressed a lot of organizations across the U.S. government, particularly DOD as well, to move to telework, we started getting a lot of questions about secure collaboration and which commercial tools were safe to use. And our goal was teaching people how to evaluate what's safe to use. So we issued a product which laid out the different attributes. Like: Code is available for review, its end to end encrypted, and a few other such attributes. And then we rated different secure collaboration, publicly available tools, against them. And the cool part was, we had companies call and say, 'Well, you know, you didn't get something quite right,' or 'Can we be included as well?' And we said, 'Absolutely.' And we issued a second version. And then we have another one coming out next week, because our goal was making it as useful as possible and also helping teach people how to assess different products for security.\u00a0 You asked the question about, how we measure impact? So there's three different measures we've been using. The first is, do we see patch rates go up? Do we see, for vulnerabilities that we've talked about, here is a foreign actor that might be using a vulnerability to achieve an objective? Can we watch those patriots go up? And, you know, it was really cool to see, in a number of cases\u00a0 we've watched that increase.\u00a0 The second piece is there is a very capable and active cybersecurity industry. Has the information shared enabled them to better protect sensitive U.S. government, national security systems, networks? And in the case of the Exim vulnerability that we issued, the advisory where we talked about the particular unit of Russian intelligence using the Exim mail vulnerability, it was really great to see five different cybersecurity entities using that to identify other Russian intelligence infrastructure and then take that down. So that was success for us, that we made it harder for that adversary to achieve its objectives.\u00a0 And then the third one is really the feedback on the number of downloads and the feedback from network administrators saying, 'This was useful, this was unique, timely and actionable. I could act on it.' MICHAEL MORELL: And then in in May, you guys took what I thought was an unprecedented step of actually openly attributing the exploitation of a vulnerability to the Russian GRU. And that seemed rare to me. And I'm wondering why you decided to actually name Russia in this instance. ANNE NEUBERGER: So first, it is rare, because as you noted earlier, implicitly, attribution is hard. You may have seen a prior product where we highlighted one nation state using another country's infrastructure to achieve its objective and that highlighted just how hard attribution is. So when it's done it needs to be done with precision to be confident in that.\u00a0 And we chose to do it because we see that it makes targeted network owners more quickly patched and secure and build the resilience of their systems. Network administrators have way more vulnerabilities to address than they have time for, or frankly, money for and way more alerts than they can act on. So if we can say, 'This particular vulnerability is being used by a nation-state intelligence service, we see network administrators moving quickly and addressing it. And that's our fundamental goal: our fundamental goal is improving cybersecurity. MICHAEL MORELL: So Anne, if you kind of step back and look at the big picture here, you know, maybe from a 35,000 foot level: How are we doing against the cyber threat? Are we barely keeping up? Or are we catching up? Are we getting ahead of the game or is it always going to be hard for the defender in this game because the guy on the offense can always come up with something new? How do you think about where we are in the history of the threat of cyber and the defense against it? ANNE NEUBERGER: I think three points. Overall, technology is getting more secure. Technology is built more securely today. So the fundamental resilience is improving. When you have open source products, you have lots of eyes looking at a given technology and helping find vulnerabilities and address them.\u00a0 That being said, we're an ever more connected economy and an ever more connected society. And as we build more connections, sometimes the systems that were not necessarily built for those kinds of connections, I think SCADA systems in that way, we bring in introduce new risks.\u00a0 On the third pole, though, and on the positive side, there's far more awareness about those risks and how to approach addressing them, identifying what are the most important assets to protect and ensuring good practices are in place. And it's far easier than ever to put that in place.\u00a0 So I think it's a mixed story. On the one hand, more and more technologies built more securely, and there are communities of individuals working together to ensure they're secure. On the other hand, far more technology, some of which is connected in ways that bring risk in ways that we always have to \u2013 and, I guess the third part, which is where we started \u2013 adversaries seeking to take advantage of those risks to achieve their objectives. MICHAEL MORELL: So Anne, if you were standing in front of a large multinational board of directors and you were talking to them about cybersecurity, what's the one or two things that you would absolutely want them to take away from from your conversation? ANNE NEUBERGER: What is the tangible thing you most want to protect and what's the intangible thing you most want to protect? So if you're a drug company, what is the intellectual property that's going to be your next potentially big drug, big driver of economic growth, big driver of healing?\u00a0 And then second, what's the biggest intangible thing? Perhaps that's your reputation, the way you treat your employees, the prices that you charge and how much you mark that up. Make sure that you're protecting both carefully because, you make your your cybersecurity commensurate with the risk presented to you if you lose either one. MICHAEL MORELL: Anne you mentioned SCADA systems, and I'm not sure that all my listeners know what those are. Could you just explain that? And then is there something is there something special about protecting a SCADA system from protecting a normal network? ANNE NEUBERGER: Absolutely. So SCADA systems are essentially control systems for the core areas of infrastructure in a given country, ina given company. So think power systems, clean water, drug manufacturing \u2013 and those are those are often complex systems. So what's unique about them is, those systems over the years were often built for reliability in the event of a bad storm, that a power system would come back online with confidence.\u00a0 As more technologies got connected \u2013 so, for example, the ability to measure the use of power, the ability to measure confidence in water and chemical levels \u2013\u00a0 some of those systems got connected to network systems that provide a way to access them. So there is risk in that.\u00a0 One of the reasons that one of the joint products we recently issued between NSA and DHS was an ICS product because there had been some public articles about a given attack against SCADA systems in the Middle East. And we wanted to ensure that we, together with DHS, one of our closest partners, was providing technical advice to SCADA entities in the U.S. based on what we were learning about those attacks. MICHAEL MORELL: So Anne, just a couple of more questions; you've been terrific with your time. There seems to be an effort on the part of NSA to kind of open up the black box and kind of shed the reputation of \"No Such Agency,\" right. Your conversation with me, I think, is an example of that. Why is that a priority for the agency and for General Nakasone? ANNE NEUBERGER: First, in the cybersecurity mission, fundamentally, if we're not trusted, we can't achieve our impact. People take advice from those they trust -- across the US government, Team USA works cyber. Each organization plays its position within that role. You know, my counterpart at DHS, Chris Krebs, often talks about them being the national risk managers. At NSA, we believe what we can bring uniquely is that integration of intelligence, what adversaries are seeking to do, what their capabilities are, what their infrastructure looks like, and how to defend against it, cybersecurity advice to counter that. And that's always continuing because technologies change, adversaries' goals change, and the resilience always has to be increased to meet that.\u00a0 So if we want to be trusted to achieve what we believe we can uniquely contribute to Team USA on cyber, the first step to doing that is conveying who we are, conveying the culture that's here, the commitment to American values. And certainly, when a part of our mission is an intelligence mission in a in a democracy, we have an obligation to ensure that the Americans we serve feel they understand the values by which we live. MICHAEL MORELL: So your former colleague and my really good friend, Glenn Gerstell, wrote an op-ed about a year ago about what he saw as the profound implications of the digital revolution on national security. And he raised a lot of concerns. And among those was the sheer pace and scale and volume of technological change, and data that's going to force intelligence agencies, including NSA, to fundamentally change how they do business.\u00a0 How is NSA thinking big picture about those kinds of challenges? What are you trying to tackle first? What do the adjustments look like? How do you think about the challenge that Glenn laid out? ANNE NEUBERGER: Absolutely. So first, from the perspective of large amounts of data and ensuring we can make sense of them, ensuring that we can do big data analysis to help triage the information we identify and determine what our people, our biggest assets, put their time on to determine key threats and how to act on that.\u00a0 So, for example, we're looking at machine learning to classify malware to help us understand what's routine malware versus what's something new. And we're certainly looking at machine learning, potentially, to help us identify vulnerabilities at scale, particularly when we look at systems that represent 30 years of technology like weapon systems: How do you secure a weapons system that's been out there and represents each phase of technology and have confidence in its resilience and its command and control?\u00a0 And then finally, we have an obligation to both bring those technologies to be on our mission and understand how adversaries might use that and manage that accordingly. So, for example, as we think about artificial intelligence and the potential to automatically direct a weapon. In the United States, we have strong values around how we would think about automation versus human control. In other countries around the world, there might be different ways that those kinds of decisions are approached.\u00a0 So how do we ensure that we both bring that integration of values, compliance and technology to the way we pursue it, but also be aware of those gaps and keep an eye on the risks of those gaps? MICHAEL MORELL: Anne, you mentioned people a couple of times. And just two questions about that. One is, given the competition that you face, right, with all of these cybersecurity firms and, you know, your folks must be very attractive to them and their skills are quite valuable in the private sector. How difficult is it for you to recruit and retain talent? ANNE NEUBERGER: Really thoughtful question, because you asked two questions in there: recruit and retain. So from the recruit side, we get really great people. On the retain side, we have a really compelling mission. And what brings what keeps people here is the sense that they are contributing to something bigger than themselves that is challenging and fulfilling.\u00a0 It's on us as organizational leaders to ensure that each person has that opportunity to contribute what they can uniquely bring to that mission. And one of the cool aspects of the cyber security stand-up has been people who have left to call in and say, 'Hey, I'd like to come back. I learned a lot in the private sector, the mission's calling me and I'd like to contribute again.' And, you know, we've hired a number of them back and continue to increase that. And part of the message we have when people, if people do decide to leave, is to say, 'That is great. You will continue to contribute to the nation's security. You'll learn a lot in the private sector. And if you ever want to come back, the door is open.' MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. And then in a related question and last question, Anne, what do you want the American people to know about the women and men who work for you? ANNE NEUBERGER: That they're committed to the values that this country was established for. That there are significant threats to the United States, our allies and to those values. And that not always can we talk about those threats because, by impact, sometimes the intelligence community, even the cyber security mission, has to operate in the shadows. So, trust our values. Trust that we are proud Americans. We swear an oath to the Constitution of the United States.\u00a0 And if you do question it, or if you want to learn more, roll up your sleeves and come into the IC for a few years and get to know it yourself.\u00a0 Because each person has unique abilities and a unique ability to contribute to their country in whatever way they choose, whether that's in government or in the private sector. But if you ever doubt it, come on in and work here and raise your voice and be a part of it. MICHAEL MORELL: It sort of takes you back to what your parents taught you, too. ANNE NEUBERGER: It really does. My dad grew up in communist Hungary, and in the beginning when I came into government, he would call me on the phone sometimes and switch to a foreign language. And I realized that for him, growing up in another country, there never is that complete trust of government that I, American-born, had. That doesn't mean it's trust and not-verify. It's trust and verify. But there are things that I take for granted growing up in this society that I don't know if he ever will. So being able to look at things through his eyes and through mine make me realize how fortunate we are to be here, and how much we have an obligation to ensure it stays that way. MICHAEL MORELL: Anne, thank you so much for joining us. And thank you for your service. ANNE NEUBERGER: Thank you so much for your time.",

            "article_content": "The 2020 presidential election could be decided by just a handful of states \u2014 and if the race is anything like 2016's, only a small margin of votes in those states could determine the outcome. As of 1:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday, CBS News has projected President Trump as the winner in Florida, Iowa, Ohio and Texas and Joe Biden as the winner in New Hampshire and Minnesota. The other states have yet to be projected. Regardless of the popular vote, the next president will be decided by which candidate, Mr. Trump or Biden, can win at least 270 votes in the Electoral College. This year, CBS News polling had identified six \"toss-up\" states, and seven more that are leaning toward one candidate but could still swing either way. These are the 13 states to keep an eye on during\u00a0Election Day: As of 11 p.m. ET on election night, CBS news estimated Arizona is leaning Democratic.\u00a0 Mr.\u00a0 Trump won the state by roughly 3.5 percentage points in 2016. Phoenix's Maricopa County \u2014 which accounts for about 60% of the state's votes \u2014 was the largest county that went for Mr. Trump in 2016. No Democratic presidential nominee has won Arizona in 24 years, since Bill Clinton took the state, and the state has gone red in every presidential election since 1952 with the exception of 1996. Biden has gained on Mr. Trump with support from the state's large senior population. Early voting data analyzed by Arizona data firm OH Predictive Insights ranks 65 and older voters as by far the largest return rate of all age groups in Maricopa County since early voting kicked off.\u00a0 Nearly 1 in 5 Arizona residents are 65 or older.\u00a0 \"Having seniors be very much disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 outbreak here has really shifted some of them who are ordinarily somewhat conservative voters to the Democratic column,\" Smith said. Almost half of Arizona seniors say Mr. Trump's response to the outbreak has put seniors and older voters at risk for coronavirus, and 95% of seniors who feel that way are backing Biden.\u00a0 Democrats are also hoping to capture the Senate seat. Incumbent Republican Senator Martha McSally lost in 2018 to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and then was appointed to the late Senator John McCain's seat. McSally has been consistently trailing Democrat Mark Kelly in polls.\u00a0 CBS News projected Mr. Trump as the winner in Iowa. The state voted for former President Obama in both 2008 and 2012, Mr. Trump won Iowa by 10 points in 2016. Despite gaining ground lost by the Democrats in 2016, Biden has been unable to pull ahead in Iowa, as Mr. Trump still has a large advantage among voters without a college degree and White evangelicals, a group that made up a third of Iowa's electorate in 2016.\u00a0 A Des Moines Register poll released on the Saturday before Election Day had some hope for Mr. Trump, showing him opening up a 7 point advantage over Biden, 48% to 41%. Mr. Trump will be in Dubuque. Iowa, on Sunday to campaign, and the campaign announced shortly after the poll was released that Ivanka Trump will visit Des Moines on Monday.\u00a0 Shortly after midnight ET on Wednesday, CBS News projected Mr. Trump as the winner in Ohio.\u00a0 Ohio is a crucial victory, not just for its 18 Electoral College votes but because the winner of Ohio has also taken the White House for the last 14 presidential elections, including when the state turned red in 2016.\u00a0 Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown has predicted that Joe Biden will win his state. \"It's clear Trump is afraid he's going to lose Ohio this time,\" Brown told CBSN anchor Elaine Quijano. University of Dayton political science professor Nancy Martorano Miller told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Tony Dokoupil that she's surprised Mr. Trump has not been able to secure a lead in the state. \"There's an increasingly growing gap with suburban women,\" Miller said. \"And, you know, it is so much harder to run as the incumbent. It's very easy to run as, 'I am something different, I see you. I'm going to help you.'\"\u00a0 As of 11 p.m. on election night, CBS News estimated North Carolina as a toss-up. Mr. Trump has visited the state a dozen times, including a rally on the Sunday before Election Day in Hickory, North Carolina. The Biden campaign also targeted the state, with Harris campaigning there on the Sunday before Election Day. The Biden campaign targeted more urban municipalities with more Democratic voters. \u00a0 A U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that mail-in ballots postmarked by 5 p.m. on Election Day should be accepted until November 12, the News & Observer reports. State Republican leaders and the Trump campaign filed appeals to the decision on Thursday.\u00a0 As of 11 p.m. on election night, CBS News estimated Georgia as a toss-up. \u00a0 Early in-person voting numbers have already broken records, with close to two million people turning out to the polls. Georgia's Secretary of State\u00a0Brad Raffensperger told CBSN that early voting and absentee voting \u2014\u00a0 a process that Mr. Trump has, without evidence, linked to fraud \u2014 is the easiest and most secure way for residents to cast their ballots. Greg Bluestein, a political reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, told CBSN host Elaine Quijano that the surge in early voting appears to favor Democrats, but said nothing is sure until Election Day.\u00a0 \"It couldn't be closer\u2026 poll after poll after poll in Georgia show it too close to call,\" Bluestein said. Just after 1 a.m. on Wednesday, CBS News projected Mr. Trump had won Florida. With its 29 electoral college votes \u2014 and Mr. Trump's adopted home state since he changed his residence to Mar-a-Lago \u2014 Florida was a coveted prize.\u00a0 Almost 2.5 million people voted early as of Sunday, nearly surpassing the total number of votes cast in the state in the entire 2016 election.\u00a0 The president has been to Florida to campaign more than a dozen times this year, compared to Biden who has been three times. Mr. Trump won the perennial swing state in 2016 by just under 113,000 votes.\u00a0 Dozens of voters in Alachua County, Florida, a heavily Democratic county, reported receiving emails purporting to come from the right-wing group the Proud Boys, threatening to \"come after\" them unless they vote for Mr. Trump.\u00a0 Alachua County is home to the city of Gainesville and the University of Florida, making it a Democratic stronghold in a deep-red part of the state. The county voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump in 2016 by a margin of 58% to 36%. As of 11 p.m. on election night, CBS News estimated Nevada leans Democratic. Mr. Trump narrowly lost the state in 2016. Nevada has gone Democratic since 2004, and did so again two years ago during the 2018 midterm's \"blue wave.\" Despite recent gains, political strategists and organizers warn that Nevada remains a swing state this year.\u00a0 According to CBS News polling, most Hispanic voters feel the Trump campaign is paying too little attention to the needs and concerns of Hispanic people.\u00a0 The Trump campaign and Republicans in Nevada are threatening the battleground state's most populous county with legal action over what they argue is a \"blatant disregard for accountability and transparency\" in the ballot counting process. GOP attorneys said in a letter this week that Clark County requested to place cameras throughout the ballot counting facility, and complained that counting board members are mishandling ballots in a way that \"undermines the American norm of ballot secrecy.\" Democrats in the state dismissed the letter as \"yet another blatant attempt to suppress voter turnout.\"\u00a0 CBS News has projected Mr. Trump as the winner in Texas.\u00a0 Mr. Trump won the deep red state by 807,179 votes in 2016, or about 9 points. But that margin was less than Mitt Romney's victory in 2012, a warning sign for Republicans, and Democrats made major gains in the 2018 election.\u00a0 Early voter turnout in the state surpassed 2016's total voter turnout.\u00a0 In September, voters in both Florida and Texas said the president would do a better job handling the economy, and many more Texas voters said Mr. Trump's economic policies would help their family's financial situation. However, Hispanic Texas voters' support for Biden is widespread and cuts across generational lines. Six in 10 Hispanic likely voters in the state, young and old, currently support Biden.\u00a0 CBS News has projected Biden won Minnesota.\u00a0 Mr. Trump announced he had tested positive for COVID-19 after returning from a rally in Minnesota on September 30. The president used the platform to go after refugees and Representative Ilhan Omar.\u00a0 Minnesota has not chosen a Republican for president since 1972, but Mr. Trump narrowly lost the state in 2016. As of 11 p.m. on election night, CBS News estimated Wisconsin is a toss-up.\u00a0 According to the CBS News Battleground Tracker earlier this week, Biden was leading Wisconsin by 5 points, with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. Biden appears to have cut into the president's 2016 support levels with key groups like men, White, non-college voters and seniors. Wisconsin, like Arizona, has an older electorate who tend to vote Republican. A recent rise in coronavirus cases, however, could sway that key demographic for Mr. Trump. Biden supporters note that the virus as a major reason they're choosing him over Mr. Trump, believing he would handle the outbreak better. As of 11 p.m. on election night, CBS News estimated Michigan as a toss-up. Mr. Trump narrowly flipped the state red in 2016; the shift, along with other Rust Belt states Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, helped him secure the White House.\u00a0 Flipping Michigan is crucial to Democrats to win the White House. Former President Obama joined Biden on the campaign trail in Michigan on the Saturday before Election Day. CBS polling shows that Mr. Trump's razor-thin 2016 victory \u2014 just 10,704 votes \u2014 could be threatened this year by how he's handled the coronavirus. More Michigan voters say his response made them feel angry, rather than confident, and most said they think the Trump administration's policies are making the outbreak worse.\u00a0 It is unclear if Mr. Trump's unfavorable coronavirus response is significant enough to determine how the state swings. Michigan voters are divided over which candidate will handle the economy better, and about a third who said they are voting for Trump also say they dislike the way the president handles himself.\u00a0 In Western Michigan, long a Republican stronghold, Democrats are optimistic that success in recent elections indicate that the race is tighter than the polls show. As of 11 p.m. on election night, CBS News estimated Pennsylvania as a toss-up. Pennsylvania holds 20 votes on the Electoral College map, making it one of the most valuable election prizes. Mr. Trump carried Pennsylvania by less than 1% in 2016. The state is home to more than 700,000 union members, a key group that Mr. Trump capitalized on in 2016. Mr. Trump won more union votes nationwide than any Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan; in Pennsylvania, he won White voters without college educations by a margin of more than 2 to 1.\u00a0 Winning Pennsylvania may again come down to blue-collar workers \u2014 specifically those in the state's booming fracking industry. Some 32,000 Pennsylvania workers are employed in the fracking and natural gas industry.\u00a0 Biden told voters there in July that fracking \"is not on the chopping block,\" but he took a hit in March when he appeared to say he wanted \"no new fracking.\" Groups supporting the Trump campaign quickly weaponized the comments in the gas-rich state. Biden and Harris later doubled down on maintaining the practice. Harris explained at the vice presidential debate that the Biden administration's climate plan would focus on creating new jobs, and that \"part of those jobs\u2026 are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy.\" CBS News has projected that Joe Biden has won New Hampshire. Mr. Trump narrowly lost New Hampshire four years ago.\u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence held a campaign rally in Portsmouth on October 21 as part of an aggressive travel schedule through battleground states. He rallied the crowd by claiming Biden is a socialist who will raise taxes, and promising economic revival under President Trump's second term.\u00a0",

These eye-popping numbers shattered the previous record for fundraising,\u00a0Beto O'Rourke's $38 million cash haul\u00a0in the third quarter of 2018. Now the Democrats are spending that money in the face of massive Republican super PAC funds, report\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0and\u00a0Eleanor Watson. And it's left many Republican candidates with more cash on hand than the Democrats in the final weeks of the race. In South Carolina, where the Senate race is unexpectedly tight, Harrison's $57 million in three months was more than double what Republican incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham raised with $28 million, a state record for a Republican. Records show from July through September, Harrison spent more than $55 million. According to his October FEC filing, Harrison paid AL Media LLC more than $42 million over three months for TV, radio and digital advertising. He also spent another $6.5 million for digital advertising and services to Mothership Strategies, and $2 million to Blueprint Strategy LLC for radio and billboard advertising. $641,000 went to \"direct mailing services.\" That amounts to more than $51 million spent on ads and direct mail alone. But after being outraised roughly 2 to 1, Graham's operating expenses covered about half of what he raised, $26.5 million and another $1.75 million was transferred to the state Republican party. In their pre-general\u00a0election\u00a0filings, Harrison raised another $22 million in just 14 days from October 1 through 14, but ended the period with just $3.5 million cash on hand. Graham raised less than half of that but had $7.3 million as of October 14. Even with his record fundraising, Harrison's campaign warned it needed to raise $10 million in the 12 days before the election to beat Graham. In a memo Wednesday, his campaign manager Zack Carroll wrote \"our campaign woke up the Republican giant.\" Carroll pointed out Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's super PAC raised $92 million in September and is already spending to try and stop Harrison. \"Too many pundits don't understand what we are up against and have said the Senate campaigns like ours don't need to keep fundraising,\" it read. \"But the fact is that unless our fundraising surges in the final 12 days, we will not be able to match Mitch McConnell jeopardizing our path to victory.\" On Tuesday, Republican super PAC the Senate Leadership Fund reported it had more than $113 million cash on hand heading into October, even as Republican candidates were being outraised by Democratic challengers. It still had nearly $70 million to burn as of October 14. Democrats' Senate Majority PAC had less than $20 million October 14 and had raised more than $100 million less than what the Senate Leadership Fund brought in across 2020. Other Senate Democrats are also now at a cash disadvantage in the final stretch despite outraising GOP incumbents by millions. Read more about the state of the Senate money race\u00a0here. The Trump campaign fundraised $26 million around Thursday night's debate, marking President Trump's single largest day of online fundraising this election cycle. That GOP uptick could not come fast enough. Team Biden entered October with nearly three times as much cash on hand as the president's re-election bid, leaving Trump campaign officials to make difficult choices on ad buy placements in battleground states. Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told reporters Friday, he is hopeful field operations in places like Minnesota, Ohio and Florida will offset the Biden campaign's nationwide ad blitz. \"Joe Biden's been running a lot of TV ads. He's got nothing on the ground,\" Stepien said. The campaign manager also noted, \"We track the absentee and early vote numbers in every state. We know exactly where we stand pertaining to ballots out and ballots in.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says Mr. Trump heads to Florida Friday for back-to-back rallies. As polls show the president hemorrhaging support among seniors in the Sunshine State, Mr. Trump made his pitch to the country's largest retirement community - the Villages.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the president's visit Friday marks his 14th to the state this year and his 4th visit to the Sunshine State within the past four weeks. This is also the Trump campaign's second stop to The Villages within two weeks.\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0and\u00a0Sganga\u00a0note that seniors are among\u00a0a critical voting bloc that the president is courting, in an effort to make up ground with a group that some polls say he could be losing steam with. Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in Ohio Friday for the second time this week. Pence said Mr. Trump took the fight \"straight to Joe Biden and he won that debate hands down.\" Laughing, Pence said, \"It was amazing, I saw Joe look down at this watch, I figured he was trying to figure out how soon this thing's gonna be over.\" Pence also picked on Biden saying he would eventually replace the oil industry. \"America's strength comes in part from our vast natural resources,\" Pence said. \"We are going to continue to develop all of the resources of this land and drive a boundless American future,\" he added. The vice president continued to attack Biden on health care, claiming that Biden's plan to add a public option to Obamacare will lead to socialism. \"You take Bernie Sanders' socialist idea, you put it right in the middle of Obamacare, and you're going to put America on an inevitable path to socialist medicine,\" Pence said. Pence, who dropped off his absentee ballot in his home state of Indiana this morning along with Second Lady Karen Pence, will continue to campaign this weekend, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. In addition to making a stop in Pennsylvania this evening, Pence holds two rallies Saturday in Florida. The vice president heads to North Carolina Sunday and then another trip to Pennsylvania on Monday. After some time away from the campaign trail to prepare for the second and final presidential debate, Biden began Friday to publicly outline plans for a potential transition into the presidency amid the COVID-19 pandemic, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"I'll reach out to every governor in every state, red and blue, as well as mayors and local officials during transition to find out what support they need and how much of it they need. I'll ask the new Congress to put a bill on my desk by the end of January,\" Biden said in Delaware, as the contest enters its final stretch ahead of Election Day. Both campaigns claim the debate buoyed their prospects ahead of Election Day. However, Mr. Biden's opponents have seized on his debate stage acknowledgement that he would \"transition away from the oil industry,\" ahead of the former vice president's planned visit to Pennsylvania on Saturday. Though not much of a departure from his campaign's climate plan publicly outlined months ago, the former vice president's remark drew a firestorm from opponents. \"We'll get rid of the subsidies of fossil fuels, but not going to get rid of fossil fuels for a long time,\" Biden said late Thursday as he departed Nashville. Blue Earth County, which includes Mankato, voted for President Obama twice and then flipped for Mr. Trump in 2016, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Two years after Trump carried the county by nearly four points, the county overwhelmingly supported Democratic Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. The county includes a younger population who attend Minnesota State University, Mankato, a rural population outside of Mankato and a refugee population. Mark Halverson, the chair of the Blue Earth County Democratic Farmer Labor (DFL) Party, said he expects Biden to win the county, adding that Trump's character has turned off people in the county. \"A lot of people thought he was maybe going to be a breath of fresh air, but you know he's been just the opposite,\" he added. \"He's kind of bogged everything down in personality conflicts and temper tantrums.\" Blue Earth County is also in Minnesota's first congressional district, where Democrats are hoping to unseat Republican incumbent congressman Jim Hagedorn. Hagedorn flipped this district in 2018, defeating 2018 Democratic congressional candidate Dan Feehan. It is a rematch of 2018, with Feehan is challenging Hagedorn again in 2020. With the 2020 election just 11 days away,\u00a0CBS News social media producer Li Cohen\u00a0has compiled a comprehensive look at where the presidential candidates stand on some of the major issues facing the nation. Their stances and plans were compiled based on information available on Mr. Trump's and Biden's respective campaign sites, as well as official documents and prior CBS News reporting. Click\u00a0here\u00a0to learn where the candidates stand. Biden headed into the final 20 days of the election with a more than $107 million cash advantage over Mr. Trump, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. According to the latest Federal Election Commission filings of fundraising through October 14, Biden, the Democratic National Committee and their joint fundraising committees had more than $331 million cash on hand. Mr. Trump, the Republican National Committee and their joint fundraising committees had more than $223.5 million cash on hand heading into October 15. Looking at the Biden campaign committee, it brought in $130 million in 14 days, including $70 million in direct contributions and nearly $60 million transferred from other committees. That's three times what the Trump campaign committee brought in with its $43 million, though it did not transfer funds. The president's campaign now also has more than $1.2 million in debt. With his massive cash advantage, Biden's campaign has also spent much more than Trump's campaign over 14 days. It had about $143 million in operating expenditures. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's campaign committee spent $63 million. The president's joint fundraising committee also spent around $34 million, not including money transferred to other accounts, while the Biden joint fundraising committees spent just over $29 million on operating expenses. Operating expenses for the DNC over two weeks was $45.4 million while the RNC expenditures were $21.8 million. Pro-Biden super PAC American Bridge 21st Century has launched an 11-day, $1.6 million paid media blitz - primarily in Pennsylvania - targeting seniors, veterans, and the small-town, rural voters, report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0and\u00a0political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. The new spots include broadcast, cable, digital and radio ad buys, mail, as well as billboards and postcards. A new advertisement highlighting a former Trump supporter -- \"Preacher\" -- will begin airing on Pennsylvania TV and radio this weekend, up through Election Day. American Bridge will roll out two new Pennsylvania digital ads: \"Harold\" and \"Pennsylvania Lives.\" While the American people knew this president could not be trusted to tell the truth, the COVID-19 pandemic gave Donald Trump's dishonesty and incompetence new meaning for millions of families -- and they are ready for a change,\" said American Bridge 21st Century President Bradley Beychok. \"American Bridge 21st Century began our first ever paid media program with a clear mission to undercut Trump's support with seniors, rural communities, and the White working class voters who propelled him to narrow victories in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 2016. In the final days of this election, it's never been more clear that the president has no path to reelection without these Blue Wall states. American Bridge 21st Century is closing out the election with a final push to ensure Pennsylvania goes blue, fighting as hard as we can up until the minute polls close to elect Joe Biden the next President of the United States.\" The 7-figure buy includes TV and radio in markets in Erie, Harrisburg, Johnstown, Pittsburgh, Wilkes Barre-Scranton,as well as statewide digital targeting. Gun rights and open carry advocates in Michigan have sued Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson over her directive last week banning openly carrying firearms at polling places, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.Last Friday, Benson issued an order that said, \"the open carry of a firearm is prohibited in a polling place, in any hallway used by voters to enter or exit, or within 100 feet of any entrance to a building in which a polling place is located.\" The directive said concealed carry is not allowed at any building that already prohibits the practice. The lawsuit filed by Michigan Open Carry, Michigan Gun Owners and Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners claims that Benson's directive \"makes an unsupported correlation between mere possession of a firearm and voter intimidation; and, is conjured without any legal basis or authorization under Michigan law.\" Some local law enforcement officials in Michigan have indicated they don't plan to enforce the order. Earlier this week Benson defended the order, telling reporters, \"This is not a ban on firearms. This is an effort to protect our voters from intimidation, threats and harassment on Election Day itself.\" Benson said her understanding is Michigan State Police will help enforce the directive where local law enforcement is choosing not to. Democrats in Ohio's Appalachian region are approaching the 2020 general election with a mix of optimism and concern,\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. It is unlikely that Biden will win Ohio's Appalachian region, but Democrats are hoping to diminish Republican strength in this heavily conservative area. \"I'm terrified. I have said a hundred times I don't think that there has ever been an election in which I was old enough to vote that I was actually afraid of who might win,\" said Mary Jane Tullius, a 71-year-old Democrat living in Beverly, Ohio. Democrats in the region are enthusiastic about their party in 2020, citing Mr. Trump's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and their disdain for the president. Republican enthusiasm is evident in the region with lawn signs supporting the president and opposing abortion. The Trump campaign has touted its field operation in the state, recently noting that its operation has made 12 million voter contacts. Ohio's Appalachian region has been plagued by poverty and opioid addiction, but the manufacturing industry saw some growth in the state since the Great Recession. That growth slowed at the end of 2019 and job losses ensued early on in the COVID-19 pandemic. Local mayors along the Ohio River who spoke with CBS News attributed job growth in their towns to local and state efforts. \"If we are going to do something, we need to raise the money or find the funding on our own,\" said Belpre, Ohio, Mayor Michael Lorentz. It was another busy day for Pennsylvania courts making elections rulings,\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Friday that mail ballots and applications can't be challenged or rejected for signatures mismatches. The court's two conservative justices joined its five liberal ones in ruling that subjective signatures analysis can't be the reason any ballot is rejected in the key battleground state. \"County boards of elections are prohibited from rejecting absentee or mail-in ballots based on signature comparison conducted by county election officials or employees, or as the result of third-party challenges based on signature analysis and comparisons,\" Justice Debra Todd wrote in the opinion. Pennsylvania's elections chief had issued guidance in September in line with that interpretation of the law, and the Trump campaign asked a federal district court judge to deem it unconstitutional. That court dismissed the lawsuit earlier this month, and Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar asked the state's top court to use it's \"King's Bench\" power to affirm the legality of her directive on ballot rejections. This is the first year that Pennsylvania, a state worth 20 electoral votes, is allowing no-excuse mail-in voting. Nearly a third of the state's 9 million registered voters have applied for a mail-in or absentee ballot, and two thirds of those voters are Democrats. Also on Friday, a Pennsylvania state court rejected an appeal effort from the Trump campaign over Philadelphia's elections officials not allowing poll watchers in satellite elections offices. The campaign had argued that offices qualify as polling places and therefore poll watchers are allowed in them. The offices allow people to register to vote, apply for a ballot, receive it, fill it out and return it in one trip. Philadelphia's elections officials, the top state elections official and then a Philadelphia judge each said they do not qualify as polling places. A three-judge Commonwealth Court panel today decided that the lower court was correct because the judge's opinion, \"thoroughly discusses, and correctly disposes of, the legal issues before this Court,\" wrote Judge Ellen Ceisler in the concurring opinion. Two GOP congressional candidates have a similar lawsuit on going federal court in the Western District of the state. A Texas state court of appeals on Friday upheld a lower court's decision that blocked Governor Greg Abbott's order limiting counties to one drop-off site for mail ballots, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0Republicans are expected to appeal the decision to the Texas Supreme Court, so it's unclear if more drop-off sites will open. This is separate from a federal case where an appeals court ruled that Abbott's order was valid. Texas does not offer no-excuse mail voting. To vote by mail, voters have to be either 65 years or older, disabled, out of the county on Election Day and early voting period, or in jail but otherwise eligible. More than 787,000 Texans have already voted by mail, but another 5.6 million have voted early in-person. Combined, more than 37.7% of registered Texans have voted and already turnout is at 71% of the total turnout from the 2016 presidential election. DEBATE FALLOUT \"Will you remember that, Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?\" Mr. Trump said during Thursday's debate, after Biden said he'd transition away from fossil fuels to eventually replace them with renewable energy source. While Oklahoma is not a battleground state for the presidential race, the mention may have been a reference for the state's 5th district, one of the most notable pickup opportunities for Republicans. Oklahoma's 5th district has several major oil and gas companies that use fracking, and while she has spoken out against a\u00a0ban on it before, freshman Democrat Kendra Horn was quick to show some distance between her and Biden. \"Here's one of the places Biden and I disagree. We must stand up for our oil and gas industry. We need an all-of-the-above energy approach that's consumer friendly, values energy independence, and protects OK jobs. I'll keep fighting for that in Congress,\" Horn\u00a0tweeted\u00a0after the debate. Her Republican opponent, state Senator Stephanie Bice,\u00a0called on her\u00a0to outright disavow Biden's transition away from the oil industry. National Republican groups such as the National Republican Congressional Committee or the Congressional Leadership Fund have been highlighting Biden's comments to target Horn, several Democrat challengers in Texas and Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small in New Mexico's 2nd. \"Congresswoman Torres Small and Joe Biden will both say whatever it takes to get elected, but the one thing that remains true is that they are both dead set on ending good paying energy jobs,\" CLF press secretary Will Reinert said in a press release. Like Horn, Torres Small also voiced her disagreement with Biden on Thursday,\u00a0tweeting, \"I will continue to stand up to my party when they're out of touch with the reality on the ground in #NM02.\" The freshman Democrat has been outspoken on the issue before through\u00a0debates\u00a0and\u00a0ads.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says the oil and gas industry claim to support 51,000 jobs in the district, directly or indirectly, with its revenues accounting for \"almost 20% of the district's total economy.\" In Texas' 23rd, Republican Tony Gonzales called on Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones on Friday to pledge to oppose Biden's \"radical environmental policies.\" Jones' spokesperson Sharon Yang told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that Jones doesn't support a ban on fracking and believes energy leaders should be incentivized to participate in more clean technology development. \"Texas is already a clean energy superpower, and Gina is committed to building on Texas' leadership and investing in our workers so we can address the threat climate change poses to our national security, our economic security, and our public health while creating more good-paying jobs in South and West Texas,\" Yang said in a statement. Jones is in a competitive race for the state's open seat, left by retiring Republican Congressman Will Hurd.",

            "article_content": "Pope Francis endorsed same-sex civil unions for the first time as pontiff while being interviewed for the feature-length documentary \"Francesco,\" which premiered Wednesday at the Rome Film Festival. The papal thumbs-up came midway through the film that delves into issues Francis cares about most, including the environment, poverty, migration, racial and income inequality and the people most affected by discrimination. \"Homosexual people have the right to be in a family. They are children of God,\" Francis said in one of his sit-down interviews for the film. \"You can't kick someone out of a family, nor make their life miserable for this. What we have to have is a civil union law; that way they are legally covered.\" While serving as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis endorsed civil unions for gay couples as an alternative to same-sex marriages. However, he had never come out publicly in favor of civil unions as pope. The Jesuit priest who has been at the forefront in seeking to build bridges with gay people in the church, the Rev. James Martin, praised the pope's comments as \"a major step forward in the church's support for LGBT people.\" \"The Pope's speaking positively about civil unions also sends a strong message to places where the church has opposed such laws,\" Martin said in a statement. Catholic Church teaching holds that gay people must be treated with dignity and respect but that homosexual acts are \"intrinsically disordered.\" A 2003 document from the Vatican's doctrine office stated that the church's respect for gay people \"cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.\" That document was signed by the then-prefect of the office, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI and Francis' predecessor. Patrick Hornbeck, a professor of theology at Fordham University, said on CBSN that he didn't expect to see church teaching change anytime soon because of Francis' endorsement of civil unions. \"What the pope has done today in these comments is he's given a permission slip to Catholics and to Catholic leaders who want to take that extra step, who want to be pastoral, as he's been, in affirming LGBT people and their families and their loves, and that's no small thing,\" Hornbeck said. \"We have to remember that there are places all around the world where to be gay is to be thrown out of your family, where it's to be beaten, where to be trans is to take your life in your hands, and so the pope's statements, I think, will have an important effect and need to be celebrated that way.\" One of the main characters in the documentary is Juan Carlos Cruz, the Chilean survivor of clergy sexual abuse whom Francis initially discredited during a 2018 visit to Chile. Cruz, who is gay, said that during his first meetings with the pope in May 2018 after they patched things up, Francis assured him that God made Cruz gay. Cruz tells his own story in snippets throughout the film, chronicling both Francis' evolution on understanding sexual abuse as well as to document the pope's views on gay people. Director Evgeny Afineevsky had remarkable access to cardinals, the Vatican television archives and the pope himself. He said he negotiated his way in through persistence and deliveries of Argentine mate tea and Alfajores cookies that he got to the pope via some well-connected Argentines in Rome. \"Listen, when you are in the Vatican, the only way to achieve something is to break the rule and then to say, 'I'm sorry,'\" Afineevsky said in an interview ahead of the premiere. The director worked official and unofficial channels starting in early 2018 and ended up so close to Francis by the end of the project that he showed the pope the movie on his iPad in August. The two recently exchanged Yom Kippur greetings; Afineevsky is a Russian-born Jew now based in Los Angeles. On Wednesday, Afineevsky's 48th birthday, the director said Francis presented him with a birthday cake during a private meeting at the Vatican. But \"Francesco\" is more than a biopic about the pope. Wim Wenders did that in the 2018 film \"Pope Francis: A Man of His Word,\" which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. \"Francesco,\" is more a visual survey of the world's crises and tragedies, with audio from the pope providing possible ways to solve them. Afineevsky, who was nominated for an Oscar for his 2015 documentary \"Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom,\" traveled the world to film his pope movie: The settings include Cox's Bazaar in Bangladesh where Myanmar's Rohingya sought refuge; the U.S.-Mexico border; and Francis' native Argentina. \"The film tells the story of the pope by reversing the cameras,\" said Vatican communications director Paolo Ruffini, who was one of Afineevsky's closest Vatican-based collaborators on the film. Ruffini said that when Afineevsky first approached him about a documentary, he tried to tamp down his hopes for interviewing the pope. \"I told him it wasn't going to be easy,\" he said. But Ruffini gave him some advice: names of people who had been impacted by the pope, even after just a brief meeting. Afineevsky found them: the refugees Francis met with on some of his foreign trips, prisoners he blessed, and some of the gay people to whom he has ministered. \"I told him that many of those encounters had certainly been filmed by the Vatican cameras, and that there he would find a veritable gold mine of stories that told a story,\" Ruffini said. \"He would be able to tell story of the pope through the eyes of all and not just his own.\" Francis' outreach to gay people dates to his first foreign trip in 2013, when he uttered the now-famous words \"Who am I to judge,\" when asked during an airborne news conference returning home from Rio de Janeiro about a purportedly gay priest. Since then, he has ministered to gay people and transsexual prostitutes and welcomed people in gay partnerships into his inner circle. One of them was his former student, Yayo Grassi, who along with his partner visited Francis at the Vatican's Washington, D.C., embassy during the pope's 2015 visit to the U.S. The Vatican publicized that encounter, making video and photos of it available, after Francis was ambushed during that same visit by his then-ambassador, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who invited the anti-same-sex marriage activist Kim Davis to meet with the pope. News of the Davis audience made headlines at the time and was viewed by conservatives as a papal stamp of approval for Davis, who was jailed for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The Vatican, however, vigorously sought to downplay it, with the Vatican spokesman saying the meeting by no means indicated Francis' support for her or her position on same-sex marriage. However, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was fervently opposed to same-sex marriage when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires. Then, he launched what gay activists remember as a \"war of God\" against Argentina's move to approve same-sex marriage. The pope's authorized biographer, Sergio Rubin, said at the time of his 2013 election that Bergoglio was politically wise enough to know the church couldn't win a straight-on fight against same-sex marriage. Instead, Rubin said, Bergoglio urged his fellow bishops to lobby for same-sex civil unions instead. It wasn't until Bergoglio's proposal was shot down by the conservative bishops' conference that Bergoglio publicly declared his opposition, and the church lost the issue altogether. Francis, in the new documentary, confirms Rubin's account of what transpired. Of his belief in the need for legislation to protect gay people living in civil relationships, he said: \"I stood up for that.\" Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, an organization of LGBT Catholics, praised Francis' comments as a \"historic\" shift for a church that has long been seen as persecuting gay people. \"At the same time, we urge Pope Francis to apply the same kind of reasoning to recognize and bless these same unions of love and support within the Catholic Church, too,\" he said in a statement. However, more conservative commentators sought to play down Francis' words and said that while secular civil unions are one thing, a church blessing of them is quite another. In a tweet, conservative U.S. author and commentator Ryan Anderson noted that he and some of his colleagues had gone on record a decade ago saying they would support federal civil unions for any two adults who commit to sharing domestic responsibilities. Such an arrangement, Anderson said, would leave churches the option of refusing to recognize these unions as marriage.",

Intelligence Matters: Bill McKibben Producer: Olivia Gazis MICHAEL MORELL: Bill, welcome to Intelligence Matters. It is very good to have you on the show. BILL MCKIBBEN: It's a real pleasure to be with you. MICHAEL MORELL: You know, I wanted to have you on since I read your most recent book over the holiday season in December. But unfortunately, COVID and some other things got in the way. So I'm so glad we were able to make this work.\u00a0 I should tell our listeners that the book I'm talking about \u2013 Yes, the holiday season. It was a great time to read your book \u2013 I want to tell our folks that the book published last year is titled \"Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?\" And I want my listeners to know that a podcast on national security \u2013 what's a podcast on national security talking about this book for?\u00a0 And it's my view that national security is about both threats to our nation and about threats to our people. And that's what I thought about as I turned every page of your book as I read it. So that's why I wanted to have you on. You discuss two important issues in your book. One is climate change. The other is is technology. I want to primarily focus on climate change, but I do want to ask you some questions about technology as well. So let me let me start, Bill, by asking: what led you to write the book? BILL MCKIBBEN: Well, you know, I'd written the first book about climate change, a book called, \"The End of Nature,\" back in, believe it or not, 1989. So I've followed this most absorbing of topics for a very long time \u2013 really, since it became a public topic. And I felt like we needed to get a sense of where we stood three decades later. And of course, the news is mostly bad. I mean, what were warnings in the late 1980s about what would happen if we didn't take this seriously, have by now become bulletins from the front line in a planet that's increasingly under siege from changes in the climate.\u00a0 And I mean, as you were reading it over the holiday season, which seems a very long time ago, it's hard to remember now, but 2020 began with the spectacle of the continent of Australia half burning to the ground. We're far along in this story now. MICHAEL MORELL: So what's the bill what's the overall theme of the book? BILL MCKIBBEN: Well, I suppose if there's a theme, it's to let people understand both where we find ourselves, which is in a very difficult place, past the point where we can stop global warming, at the point where maybe we can still stop it short of cutting our civilisations off at the knees, but only if we move very quickly.\u00a0 That was one point, but the other was to try and help people understand how we got to this point. And I think that there's a deep connection with the, well, with the move towards societies that worshipped markets, that devalued collective action and government action, that kind of world view that began in the Reagan era and the Thatcher era, the one that said that markets solve all problems.\u00a0 I mean, look, this has not been this has not been a good year for that idea. What did the pandemic teach us along with climate change? It's that there are problems that can only be solved when we act together. Ronald Reagan used to -- his great laugh line in all his speeches was, \"The nine scariest words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help'\" \u2013 ha, ha, ha. But really, the scariest words in the English language turn out to be, 'We've run out of ventilators; The hillside behind your house is on fire.' MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So, Bill, you write in the book about something that you call 'leverage.' What is that? And why is that important? BILL MCKIBBEN: We live at a moment when every mistake gets magnified. So, I mean, look, it was completely possible for human beings to screw up in all kinds of ways at other points in our history. But our numbers were smaller and our technology less all-encompassing so, you know, it didn't matter in quite the same way. There was nothing that the Holy Roman emperor could do that could change the P.H. of the oceans, that could alter the temperature of the atmosphere, that could melt the ice caps.\u00a0 We have, between our numbers and our technological reach, the ability now to make changes that are on an unbelievable scale. And too much of that leverage also exists in too few hands. I mean, we know, I'm afraid, in our country that too many decisions get made by a tiny coterie of people who control an enormous amount of our wealth and hence our political power.\u00a0 So in every way, we're at a period of over-leverage, it seems to me. And and really, we need to figure out how to back off some, which is a hard thing for humans to do, but not an impossible one.\u00a0 You know, we actually have some emerging technologies that are different than the ones that we're used to. The engineers have dropped the price of a solar panel or a wind turbine 90 percent in the last decade. And that's really good because if we wanted to, we could move fast to deploy them. And they produce a lot less carbon than burning oil and gas. But they also, in another way, lower leverage, too.\u00a0 I mean, look, you think a lot about national security. So you know how much unearned power [is] concentrated in the hands of people who just happen to control the small deposits of hydrocarbons on which we depend. I mean, that's why we pay attention to the Koch brothers. They're our biggest political players and also our biggest oil and gas barons. That's why we pay attention to the king of Saudi Arabia. It's not like he's thought up some interesting new idea about governance \u2013 they cut people's heads off with a sword, you know \u2013 but as long as they control this thing on which we depend, they have outsized power. But everybody has some sun and some wind, and moving in those directions will help rebalance us in lots of ways. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Bill, I want to dig down, if it's OK, a little bit into climate change. And I guess I want to start by asking you: when did we realize that we had a problem with greenhouse gases and then where are we today? And and how did we get here from that moment of discovering that we had a problem? BILL MCKIBBEN: Good question and it lets us talk about all kinds of interesting history. You know, humans began changing the atmospheric chemistry about 300 years ago when we started burning coal on a large scale. And that's just been increasing ever since. It was in the late 19th\u00a0 century that the first person to alert us that really this might in real time cause real trouble \u2013 the great Swedish chemist, Svante Arrhenius, who won the Nobel for other work, managed to predict with with remarkable accuracy, since he didn't have computers to work with, about how much the temperature would increase. And nobody paid that much attention to it for most of the 20th century because we didn't have computing power large enough to really work out where the danger lines lay. But in the 1980s, scientists really began to be able to tackle this problem. And it was in those years that we started to get the first announcements.\u00a0 The most important moment came in 1988, when NASA scientist Jim Hansen testified before Congress that climate change was real and dangerous and underway. Now what we now know, thanks to great investigative reporting by many of your peers at the L.A. Times, Columbia Journalism School and elsewhere, what we now know is that the fossil fuel industry had known about this in that same time period in the 1980s. They had good scientists and their product was carbon. So they were studying it and coming up with the same conclusions.\u00a0 We know, for instance, that Exxon scientists predicted with stunning accuracy what the temperature and the CO2 concentration would be in 2020. What they didn't do was tell the rest of us. They engaged in, well, in a massive project of disinformation across the industry, spending billions of dollars in order to cloud the picture. And so we've wasted 30 years in this completely pointless debate about whether or not climate change was, quote, \"Real,\" unquote \u2013 a debate that both sides knew the answer to at the beginning. It's just one of them was willing to lie. And that lie turns out to be probably the most consequential lie in human history, because we won't get those 30 years back.\u00a0 So where we stand now is that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, which, before the industrial revolution was about 275 parts per million, is now well north of 415 parts per million. In fact, in last month it hit a new record, just about four hundred and eighteen parts per million.\u00a0 That doesn't sound like an enormous change; we're measuring it in parts per million, but it means that the temperature of the earth has already gone up about one degree Celsius, 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.\u00a0 Again, that doesn't sound so enormous. I mean, if it was 60 degrees when you walked into your office in 62, when you walked out, you wouldn't notice that much difference. But that extra heat is enough to have put huge changes in motion. It's the heat equivalent of exploding a Hiroshima-sized bomb every couple of seconds on this planet. And it's been enough heat to, for instance, melt about half the sea ice in the summer Arctic. That extra carbon has dramatically changed the PH of the oceans. We've seen big shifts in how water moves around the planet because warm air holds more water vapor than cold, and as a result, we see big increases in drought in dry areas and with it these massive and wicked wildfires. And then we see big increases in precipitation, downpour, flood in wet areas.\u00a0 And all those things are combining already to produce big human costs, including the early stages of what most people predict will be by far the biggest migrations in human history as people flee places that have simply become too hot or too salty or too flooded or too dry to allow them to go on living there. And I don't need to tell you what the national security, international security implications of that many people on the move will be. MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0So, Bill, if we don't change course, if we don't change the current set of policies and current set of activities that we conduct as human beings, then where are we headed? How bad will this get? How dangerous will it get? Is it an existential threat to us as humans? Bill MCKIBBEN: Short answer is, Yes, it is. And it's headed \u2013 I mean, it's not that difficult to kind of track where it's headed because it's almost a problem in math. You know, at current rates of production of CO2 from burning coal and oil and gas, the earth passes fairly rapidly in the course of this century through a place where the temperature increase is two degrees Celsius \u2013 That's the target,\u00a0 the kind of red line that the world's governments tried to draw in Paris in 2015. We're on a trajectory now for a temperature increase someplace between three and four degrees Celsius. And if we do that, I think the best estimate is that our odds of having civilizations anything like the ones that we know are very slim \u2013 just too much disruption, too much chaos. Already we can see, you know, places around the world where it's getting too hot for people to easily inhabit. We've seen record temperatures, the highest reliably recorded temperatures ever on the planet in the last couple of years, with cities in the Middle East registering temperatures near 130 Fahrenheit. And, you know, heat index is as high as 160, 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\u00a0 These are at the absolute limit of the human body's ability to cope. But the science is pretty clear that on current trajectories, that's what it's going to be like for days, weeks, even months across really large swaths of the planet: much of the Asian subcontinent, much of the North China plain, much of the Middle East. These are places where billions of people live. MICHAEL MORELL: And what has to change, Bill, for us to get on a trajectory to fix this problem? BILL MCKIBBEN: I mean, what has to change is, we have to stop burning coal and gas and oil. And we have to do it very quickly. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change set up by the UN, which is our main scientific body on these matters, issued a report in October 2018. It said that unless we had fundamentally transformed our energy systems by the year 2030, that our chances of meeting the targets set in Paris were essentially nil.\u00a0 And they defined that fundamental transformation as cutting in half our emissions. So that's a huge job, really hard work. It's especially hard work because we have to squeeze it into 10 years instead of the 40 that we would have had if the fossil fuel industry hadn't wasted our time with its disinformation campaigns. But that is not necessarily an impossible task. The dramatic decrease in the price of solar and wind power has changed the game in a lot of ways. And there are really important experts, people like Mark Jacobson at Stanford, who have published powerful guides as to how every state and almost every country on earth could meet those targets by 2030, 2035 at prices that are not only affordable, that are a huge bargain when you compare them with trying to pay for the damage that comes from climate change. MICHAEL MORELL: So how much of what you just talked about \u2013 I think this is probably a short question. How much of what you just talked about is accepted science and how much of it is in dispute?\u00a0 BILL MCKIBBEN: There really is no dispute within the scientific data about the basic trajectory of where we're going.\u00a0 And there really hasn't been for a long time. The science on climate change essentially became a matter of consensus by the mid 1990s. I mean, there's immense amounts of work to be done about all the different, detailed parts of it, because it's an experiment that we've never carried out before on this planet, Or, in fact, nature's kind of carried it out a few times over the course of Earth's history: every four or five of these great mass-extinction events that have been triggered by changes in the chemistry of the atmosphere. But we weren't around to observe them. So we don't know exactly how it plays out. But the basic science of climate change is absolutely settled. MICHAEL MORELL: And where does climate denial come from?\u00a0 BILL MCKIBBEN: Climate denial comes from the fact that one of the richest industries on Earth would have to surrender its business model if we took climate change seriously. I mean, there's no mystery about where it comes from. It came from the really careful, calculated efforts of the fossil fuel industry to make sure that we didn't act.\u00a0 And as I say, we've now had great investigative reporting making that clear in every way. And, you know, the good news is that finally, after 30 years, that climate denial is wearing off. I mean, obviously it still infects people like Donald Trump. But it's hard to imagine that even among his supporters, there's many people who take him seriously as a source of scientific information.\u00a0 For the rest of the world, even for the oil companies, now, at this point, they have no choice but to admit that that reality, in fact, is real. And now they're just engaged in a kind of ongoing effort to delay and postpone the inevitable. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Bill, I want to read a few quotes from your book that I found really powerful, and I just want to get you to react to them. So the first one is, \"We've used more energy and resources during the last 35 years than in all of human history.\" BILL MCKIBBEN: This is what I was trying to say about 'leverage' before, the kind of momentum of our situation.\u00a0 You know, I wrote the first book about climate change in 1989. Human beings have emitted more CO2 since that book came out than in all of human history before it. We've been powering pell-mell ahead, even in the face of the stiffest warnings from the scientific community. MICHAEL MORELL; The second one, which you've which you've talked a little bit about already, is, \"The rapid degradation of the planet's physical systems that was still theoretical when I wrote 'The End of Nature' is now underway.\"\u00a0 BILL MCKIBBEN: Yeah and of course it's just painful to look around every day and see the examples of it.\u00a0 I mean, it's appearing that 2020 will be either the first or second hottest year on record, which is really astonishing because there's no El Nino underway \u2013 that change in the Pacific Ocean temperature that usually is required to have a record temperature year.\u00a0 But now things have just gotten so hot that we look, say, at Siberia, where temperatures through the whole spring and early summer have been 20, 30 degrees Fahrenheit above what they should be. The temperature was above 100 degrees north of the Arctic Circle last month. And now there's enormous wildfires as the inevitable result of that kind of heat and the dryness that comes with it. You know, something like this is going on around the world every day. Our attention has been transfixed a little by the pandemic so that we're not paying perhaps as much attention. But, you know, we're having worldwide outbreaks of locusts at the moment, triggered by changes in weather patterns and that are chewing up a huge amount of the world's food resources. Those sort of things are are, I'm afraid, very much what the future looks like. MICHAEL MORELL: So the third quote, which you've already touched on a little bit as well, is, \"The habitable planet has literally begun to shrink; a novel development that will be the great story of our century.\" BILL MCKIBBEN: Yeah, look around. I mean, one of the effects of the rise in sea level, which is that people are beginning to abandon coastal areas, retreat away from the shore, because as sea level rises and as storms get more ferocious, that land is becoming less and less and less defensible. That will accelerate as the decades wear on. And it's very hard to imagine scenarios where we at this point manage to make it possible for cities like Miami to sustain themselves in anything like their current form. And of course, that's true all over the world in spades, because many places around the world where the sea is rising have no no resources to build walls and seawalls and things on the necessary scale.\u00a0 We also see people having to leave places because drought and desertification have just made it impossible to raise crops or to pasture animals. And so they're on the move and already on the move in fairly large numbers. Those numbers will just keep growing. The UN estimate for climate refugees in the course of this century is as high as a billion people. MICHAEL MORELL: And then the next one really, really caught my attention, got to me, actually. \"We are far more rapidly than ever before in Earth's history, filling the atmosphere with a precise mix of gases that triggered the five great mass extinctions.\"\u00a0 BILL MCKIBBEN: In the past we've had these episodes of mass extinctions because of episodes of extraordinary volcanism. You know, a thousand years \u2013 or more, millennia \u2013 of huge volcanic activity across vast areas in Siberia, in one case, India in another. What's amazing is that it turns out that, you know, you can do the work of thousands of volcanoes with a fleet of cars with V8 engines, with, a fleet of power plants. We've dug up and burned so much coal and gas and oil in the last couple of centuries that we've become a kind of out of control volcano ourselves, and CO2 levels in the atmosphere are rising faster than we've ever\u00a0 been able to see them rise anywhere in the historical record. MICHAEL MORELL: And then and then the last quote, Bill, is \"The particular politics of one country, for one 50-year period,\u00a0 will have rewritten the geological history of the Earth.\"\u00a0 BILL MCKIBBEN: Yes, this is the decision in, say, the Reagan years that we were going to go in this kind of, laissez-faire, deregulated approach to government allowed us to back away from taking action on climate change. And we have encouraged, through a series of international mechanisms like the WTO, most of the other countries in the world to take more or less the same approach to things.\u00a0 And so in this most crucial of periods when we were finding out about climate change and when the temperature was beginning to shift was precisely the moment when we rendered ourselves least able to deal with it. We kind of unequipped ourselves. MICHAEL MORELL: So just one more question on climate change, Bill and I don't know exactly how to ask it. But when will it be too late? When will inaction lead to a cascading set of consequences that it doesn't matter what we do at that point \u2013 is there such a time?\u00a0 BILL MCKIBBEN: And I think the best way to think about it is to take this concept of leverage and kind of turn it around.\u00a0 There's been a lot of negative leverage that's gotten us in the situation where we are. I think the science really indicates that the next 10 years is our period of maximum leverage to get things right, that the changes we make then \u2013 if we're able to\u00a0 move very, very quickly to renewable energy over that period, that will begin to slow and blunt the rise in temperature. And if that happens, then we can avert some of the worst.\u00a0 Not all of it. We're past the point where stopping climate change is on the menu. But if we don't do that, then, as you point out, we are already beginning to move past a series of tipping points that are irreversible. Nobody has a plan for freezing the Arctic now that it's melted. So 2030 is an important and almost literal deadline.\u00a0 And you know enough about politics and government to know that if you want something to happen in 2030, you'd better start in on it. I'm with those people who say that the election of 2020 in this country is probably going to be the most important one we ever had. And one of the reasons is, maybe the preeminent reason is, if we don't get it right very fast, our chances of getting it right slip by forever. MICHAEL MORELL: Bill let's switch gears and kind of talk about technology \u2013 walk us through your concerns.\u00a0 BILL MCKIBBEN: I'm interested as you can tell in these questions of leverage and scale, and I have a feeling that we're now seeing the emergence of new trends that are sort of where climate change was 30 years ago. That is, visible as a threat, but we're not doing anything about it. And I hope we will examine it and think about it more closely this time before it gets out of control.\u00a0 I'm talking about advanced artificial intelligence, the rise of human genetic engineering, these other technologies that I think are on a scale that makes it very difficult to imagine the kind of human future. And much of the book is about this question of what it means to be human.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Any particular technology that concerns you? BILL MCKIBBEN: As I write in the book, a good deal, I think that the prospect of human genetic engineering, in particular manipulating fetuses in embryo to produce some set of desired characteristics is a really dangerous step to be taking, and an unnecessary one, since we don't need to do it to deal with disease or defect. We would do it, if we did, in an effort to improve and enhance children. And I think that's a big mistake. I think humans as we know them, are fairly remarkable creatures and that we have all the gifts that we need, if we were to employ them, to build the kind of working world. And that's what we should be paying attention to. MICHAEL MORELL: So it's easy \u2013 well, it's not easy, but it's it's easy to comprehend how bad the situation could be if we don't get climate under control. How bad could the situation get with the concept of genetic engineering?\u00a0 BILL MCKIBBEN: I think that the concepts of human genetic engineering and artificial intelligence threaten \u2013 not apocalypse in the same way that climate change does \u2013 but threaten us with a future in which humans as humans, if that's important to you, lose much of our meaning and purchase on the planet. It's still a philosophical discussion in a sense, because these technologies aren't quite ripe. But as the book points out, these are you know \u2013 if the oil barons were determined to hang on to one view of the future, this is another view that the barons of Silicon Valley are determined to hang onto. And they have an enormous amount of leverage and power in our political system. So the rest of us better take seriously the prospect of what's coming. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Bill, when I finished the book, I had two very different and seemingly contradictory ideas in my head. One was that we're doomed, and the other is that there's hope. Can you react to that?\u00a0 BILL MCKIBBEN: The book is about the ways that we fight back. I've spent my last couple of decades really as a volunteer organizer in the climate fight. And we've tried our best to stand up against the oil industry and weaken its political power so we can make rational change. And I got to say, there are signs that that finally is working. Just in the last few weeks, we've seen plans abandoned for some of the massive pipeline projects that we've been fighting, the fossil fuel divestment effort that's now reached 14 trillion dollars' worth of endowments and portfolios that announced they don't want anything to do with hydrocarbons. That's become a huge weapon in the fight against the power of these companies.\u00a0 And it's all because of people's mobilization. When people mobilize and fight, then we have a chance even against the enormous odds that our unequal society has produced for us. And so I hope we keep doing much, much more of that, Michael. MICHAEL MORELL: The book is \"Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?\" The author is Bill McKibben. Bill, thanks so much for joining us. BILL MCKIBBEN: Thank you.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Michael Morell is a CBS News senior national security contributor and former acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In this bonus episode of Intelligence Matters, host Michael Morell offers an in-depth analysis of seven potential national security consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. He describes, among other factors, the possible effects of a prolonged financial crisis, of growing political instability, of escalating conflict in global hotspots, of the threat of a reconstitution of ISIS, and of the consequences of sustained tension in the US-China relationship. He also discusses the role of the U.S. in navigating an expected period of global turbulence.\u00a0 COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus SARS-COV-2, poses not only significant risks to our public health and to our economy; it also poses substantial risks to our national security.\u00a0 If we do not manage these risks effectively \u2013 that is, if we do not marshal the right policy responses \u2013 the damage to our national security could turn out to be every bit as severe as the public health and economic consequences of the disease. And, in some cases, those consequences could be longer lasting. A caveat \u2014 this analysis assumes that\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0will be with us for some time \u2013 perhaps 18-24 months (which is the current opinion of many medical experts), barring a breakthrough with either a vaccine or an anti-viral.\u00a0 If we get such a breakthrough soon, which is unlikely, these national security issues would be of less concern. At this point, I see at least seven potential national security consequences of COVID. The last one is the most important.\u00a0 I put it last because it builds on the some of the ones that come before. The longer the COVID crisis goes on, the higher the probability of a significant financial/debt/currency crisis in emerging markets (EMs).\u00a0 This is important because with their high growth rates and their high trade dependency, these economies have an oversized influence on the global economy and because much of the money they owe is owed to western governments and western financial institutions. Going into the COVID crisis, EM economies were not as healthy as they could have been \u2013 economic growth was already slowing (largely due to an economic slowdown in China pre-crisis), and they were highly leveraged.\u00a0 What does highly leveraged mean?\u00a0 Lots of debt.\u00a0 Public and private debt in EMs at the end of 2019 was 165-170% of GDP, up from 70% in 2007. \u00a0 In the initial weeks of the global outbreak of COVID, capital quickly began to flee EMs, as investors looked for safety in dollar-denominated assets.\u00a0 A net $90 billion left EMs in the first quarter of this year, almost all of it in March alone. That is more than double the amount of capital flight in any single quarter of the Great Recession.\u00a0 At the same time, as the U.S. dollar strengthens, the dollar-denominated debts of EMs require more local currency to service.\u00a0 So, that means the EM debt burden is rising.\u00a0 The IMF has already provided significant funding, some $15 billion, to a number of countries, but all of those have been among the poorest in the world.\u00a0 The money has not gone to EMs.\u00a0 What is going to happen in EMs?\u00a0 Economic growth there is taking \u2014 and will take \u2014 a big hit from a COVID-induced domestic economic slowdown in those countries and from the dramatic slowdown in the world economy (look for reduced exports from EMs, less tourism to them, and less remittances to them). In addition, EMs will not be able to deal with the public health aspects of the virus in their own populations, and the vast majority of them have limited fiscal and monetary tools to deal with an economic crisis at home.\u00a0 The result will be that many will not be able to service their debts. \u00a0 The result will be a line at the IMF and the World Bank as these countries look for bailouts. Who is most at risk?\u00a0 The overlap between three sets:\u00a0 (1) EMs where the virus is raging; (2) EMs with large debt burdens that require external financing; and EMs with the greatest trade dependencies. Combining all these, the countries of most concern to me are Mexico, South Africa, Colombia, Indonesia, Turkey, and Ukraine. The longer COVID lasts, the more likely we are to see a surge in political instability around the world.\u00a0 Think Arab Spring-style or a Color Revolution-style movement \u2013 just in many more countries and across a greater swath of the globe. In the short-term, the disease is a strong disincentive to popular protests, but as time goes by, politics will become more dangerous for many leaders. \u00a0 Populations around the globe are already angry \u2013 and will become angrier \u2013 with the performance of their governments with regard to both their response to the public health crisis and to the economic crisis. Some of these populations will demand change.\u00a0 And, some of that anger could well turn into political violence. \u00a0 Why does this matter? Because political instability is not healthy for the world economy, not healthy for the eventual economic recovery from the pandemic. In addition, instability can cause the movement of people across borders, it can create ungoverned territory where extremists can take root, and it can potentially significantly undermine our strategic interests.\u00a0 On this last point, think about Jordan looking like Syria or think about political chaos in Pakistan that results in the emergence of an extremist government there \u2013 one with nuclear weapons.\u00a0 Both would be significantly damaging to our national security interests. There are already early signs of such political instability \u2013 from developed countries like Italy to less developed ones like the Ukraine, Venezuela, Brazil, Italy, Colombia, and Peru.\u00a0 This list is going to grow in the weeks and months ahead. Conflict zones are areas where war is raging or areas just in the aftermath of war.\u00a0 These areas, from a COVID-19 perspective, are at significant risk. \u00a0 Many people in these countries are living in refugee camps, living in very close proximity to each other, living in unsanitary conditions, where water, food, and medical care in short supply. The governments or pseudo governments in these areas are simply not able to deal with a health crisis that is at their doorstep.\u00a0 The result will be taking an already existing humanitarian crisis and making it much worse.\u00a0 Many will die, and some will go on the move and will try to cross borders to get to where they believe to be a better place. In a worst-case scenario, one can imagine people being shot as they try to cross borders or getting through borders and increasing the health risk to their new homes. \u00a0 Which conflict zones deserve the most attention now? It is the overlap between conflict states with an outbreak of the disease and conflict states where migration could put us or our allies and partners at risk.\u00a0 Today, that list would include Iraq, Syria, and Libya, with Europe being the place where refugees would want to go; Afghanistan, with Pakistan being the go-to-place; Somalia, with Kenya the desired destination; and Yemen, with Saudi Arabia or Oman as the place to go. I would add one more country to this crisis list, although it does not meet the strict definition of a conflict state because it is not at war now and was not at war recently, but it does meet the spirit of the definition \u2013 and that is Venezuela, with Colombia the destination for refugees. There are already nearly two million Venezuelan refugees in Colombia. \u00a0 There are two dynamics at play here. The first is a perception (and the word \"perception\" is important) that authoritarian governments have been better able to deal with the crisis than have democracies. This perception opens publics to anti-democratic moves by their governments.\u00a0 And, second, anti-democratic leaders will try to take advantage of the crisis to accrue power.\u00a0 They will claim they need power in their hands to protect their populations, but they will have the objective of long-term control in mind. \u00a0 We are already seeing this play out in Hungary and the Philippines (where both legislatures have granted extraordinary powers to the executive) and in Bolivia and Sri Lanka (where elections have been cancelled).\u00a0 Many more will follow. One more point here:\u00a0 The perception that authoritarian governments are better able to handle the crisis is a myth created largely by authoritarians.\u00a0 And it is not supported by the facts.\u00a0 One only has to look at how poorly Iran has performed with regard to the virus and at how well New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan have done to know that the authoritarians' argument does not hold water. Before COVID-19, ISIS was reconstituting in Iraq and Syria, both because the pressure on it had been reduced and because of political problems in Iraq that reinforced Sunni concerns about their interests being protected by Baghdad. This has always been a dynamic that had made them more open to working with extremists. Now, add COVID-19 to the mix, which has reduced the strength of the Iraqi security forces by half (as they social distance and try to keep the virus from spreading through their ranks). ISIS attacks are up. The latest was in Samarra, just 80 miles north of Baghdad.\u00a0 And the arrest of four ISIS operatives in Germany a few weeks ago suggests the group is beginning to re-establish its western reach.\u00a0 Many have asked me whether Iran, Russia, or North Korea might try to take advantage of the COVID crisis. I am not particularly worried about North Korea because I do not believe Kim Jong Un would order the two things that would put his relationship with President Trump at risk \u2013 test a nuclear weapon or test an ICBM.\u00a0 Kim still hopes to use his relationship with the president to get a nuclear deal that is advantageous to the North \u2014 a deal where he gives up a little of his strategic weapons program in exchange for significant sanctions relief.\u00a0 I doubt the United States would do that, but I think Kim still thinks it might. Likewise, I am not too worried about Russia because, while Putin always has eye open for opportunities to strengthen his position or weaken ours and while the Russians are using anti-western COVID-related themes in their propaganda around the world, Putin is becoming more inwardly focused every day, as his\u00a0 COVID-19 cases reach critical mass.\u00a0 Iran, though, may be a different story. Iran, through its proxies, continues to harass the U.S. presence in Iraq, and as COVID has taken hold, Iran is now back to harassing shipping in the Persian Gulf.\u00a0 It has also taken other provocative steps, such as launching a \"military\" satellite, clearly designed to send a message that they are making progress on the development of an ICBM. Iran may have multiple objectives here: First, to deepen the divide between the U.S. and Europe over their respective policies toward Iran; it is interesting that our allies in Europe have not criticized Iran for its recent activities; second, to unify a population at home that is restive and unhappy with the government; and third, possibly, to convince us to leave Iraq once and for all, through pressure on our presence there at a time when we are so inwardly focused. Iran's recent behavior risks putting us right back where we were several months ago \u2013 with significantly heightened tensions and with a significantly increased risk of war. One of China's primary foreign policy objectives is obtaining significant international influence \u2013 primarily in East Asia but also globally. Why does this matter to us? Because to the extent that China obtains this influence, it will use it primarily for China's economic advantage. It will write the rules and standards in its favor; it will pressure other countries to make decisions in its favor \u2013 and a good bit of the time this will be to our disadvantage. So, what is happening as a result of COVID?\u00a0 Beijing sees the current situation as a massive opportunity to take a major step forward in acquiring global influence. What is Beijing doing? Through old-fashioned diplomacy and international aid and through a growing information operations campaign, the Chinese are portraying themselves as the provider of last resort for global health and contrasting that with the West's inability to play that role.\u00a0 As my recent guest on the show Chris Johnson \u2013 one of our country's leading China experts said \u2013 said, the Chinese are trying to change the narrative from the country where COVID-19 began and where it got its legs in part through early policy mismanagement to the country that has best managed the disease and the country best able to help others. So, specifically what are the Chinese doing? On diplomacy: While our leaders are hunkered down, looking inward, China's top leaders are making multiple phone calls a day to foreign leaders, checking in with them and asking them how they are doing, asking if they need anything. Beijing is also proposing a number of initiatives in the G-20 context (none of them particularly serious proposals), trying to appear to be a responsible global leader. On international aid: China is now providing medical supplies, trained medical personnel, and advice on handling the disease to 120 countries on five continents.\u00a0 Beijing provides such support to any country that asks. \u00a0 On information/propaganda: China's effort is aggressive, and it encompasses both an overt and a covert piece.\u00a0 This is a significant change for China.\u00a0 Beijing has long been focused on censuring certain information from reaching its population and on messaging particular themes internally. They have now added to that a significant external propaganda program. The overt message is one of solidarity between China and the world.\u00a0 For example, one of the most popular tweets in Italy in early April was one put out by the Chinese Embassy in Rome. It had a pair of drawings.\u00a0 The first depicted Italian support to China during a devastating Chinese earthquake in 2008; the second was a drawing of Chinese support to Italy today on COVID-19.\u00a0 The text of the tweet said \"You may have forgotten but we will remember forever.\u00a0 Now, it is up to us to help you.\"\u00a0 This is a powerful message, particularly when coupled with the provision of critically needed aid. \u00a0 The covert messaging employs some of the same tools the Russians used in interfering in the 2016 election. These messages include that the coronavirus is a U.S. biological weapon gone wrong; the United States is not capable of handling the crisis in its own country; and the United States, NATO and the EU are not capable of helping other countries.\u00a0 Another Chinese theme is the one we discussed earlier \u2013 authoritarian governments get this right, democracies don't. Chinese messaging has also started to amplify some of Russia's anti-western themes, given Moscow's messaging even wider dissemination. As Johnson told me on the podcast, all this messaging does not seem aimed at the U.S. population; rather, it seems aimed at third countries. I think Beijing will take additional steps in the weeks and months ahead to drive home the concept of \"China to the rescue.\" This is most likely to play out in two ways \u2013 both on economics. \u00a0 One would be stimulating demand in China once supply chains start to loosen up there (indeed, this could be one of the major policy outcomes of the coming legislative session that Chinese President Xi Jinping just called).\u00a0 Stimulating demand would be a change to recent Chinese macroeconomic policy, which has been designed to reduce debt, but a stimulus program would make sense, as it would boost not only the Chinese economy but also those of China's main trading partners as well, thereby creating additional diplomatic and messaging opportunities. \u00a0 And, the second would be playing the role of lender of last resort role to EMs who will be in need of financial assistance, building even more influence with those countries and most likely taking greater control of the IMF and World Bank in the process. To sum up, the COVID crisis is creating numerous risks on the national security, and the United States is going to have to manage these at the same time as it manages the health and economic crisis at home.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION there's a new dilemma dividing the country. Is it worth risking the health and potentially the lives of Americans in order to jump-start our paralyzed economy? With signs that social distancing and mitigation are slowing the rate of new cases, the Trump administration issued new guidelines this week, to allow some states to start loosening restrictions on residents. But with the death toll of over thirty-four thousand and rising, the U.S. has reported close to three-quarters of a million cases so far. Those stark statistics stand in the way of the push to reopen businesses. The back to work argument has its own set of jaw-dropping statistics. Thirteen percent of the labor force is out of work. Lines at food banks are getting longer. And as for small businesses looking for loan assistance from Congress' record financial bailout, that money has run out. CROWD (in unison): You work for us. MARGARET BRENNAN: That struggle is dividing America even further. ANDREW CUOMO: How does this situation get worse? And get worse quickly? If you politicize all that emotion. We cannot go there. MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week President Trump said he had full authority when it came to reopening the country. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Monday): The President of the United States calls the shots. MARGARET BRENNAN: Three days later, he told governors it's every state for itself. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Thursday): You're going to call your own shots. MARGARET BRENNAN: Then on Friday, he urged residents in three states, all with Democratic governors, to take matters into their own hands. As for governors, they're desperate for financial aid and a national testing plan from the federal government. Will they get the help they need? We'll talk with Republican Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts. Plus, take a look at the critical role testing plays in reopening the country for business with the administration's coronavirus coordinator, Doctor Deborah Birx. We'll also talk with former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb. All that and more, is just ahead on FACE THE NATION. MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome to FACE THE NATION. As America continues to suffer in these troubling times, it's hard to find the right words to begin this broadcast. Today, we thought we'd borrow from one of the country's most prolific writers, Wall Street journal columnist Peggy Noonan who wrote yesterday that this is a never-before-seen level of national economic calamity. History doesn't get bigger than this. Sobering words, but true. First up this morning is CBS News national correspondent Mark Strassmann. He's in Atlanta. Mark. MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News National Correspondent): Good morning, Margaret. And now comes the tricky part: Reversing the great American lockdown. It's every governor's call to make in this historic health crisis. But as job losses mount so does the pressure to reopen America. (Begin VT) WOMAN #1: Open our gate. We want to work. MARK STRASSMANN: It's America's corona revolt, protesters storming the gates of power. MAN: Refuse to comply. MARK STRASSMANN: Backlash in Virginia, in Texas, in California. They've lost jobs. They're fed up with stay-at-home orders. They worry America in lockdown teeters on a second Great Depression. Twenty-two million jobs lost in four weeks. WOMAN #2: You can't keep healthy people locked in their houses and watch the economy just go down. You can't do it. MARK STRASSMANN: Michigan's torn between dollar signs and vital signs. WOMAN #3: Facts over fear. MARK STRASSMANN: It ranks third nationally in COVID-19 deaths, fifth in overall cases, and no state has bled more jobs. Almost one in four workers in the last four weeks. By May 1st, Governor Gretchen Whitmer promises to review her stay-home restrictions. GRETCHEN WHITMER: I'm frustrated, too. None of us wants to be here in this moment. MARK STRASSMANN: But lifting those restrictions prematurely could spread the virus. South Dakota is one of seven states without a stay-home mandate. This now closed pork processing plant became America's hottest spot for the virus, seven hundred sixty-nine related cases. In this county, cases nearly tripled in one week. More than one hundred mayors pleaded with the governor for a stay-home order. KRISTI NOEM: I'm not going to do that at this time. I don't believe it's appropriate. MARK STRASSMANN: Consider the forty-three states with stay-at-home orders. Twenty-three have restrictions that extend to May 1st. The twenty others will continue into May or indefinitely. Phasing out restrictions will vary by state. One major issue: Testing. Who's safe to be around? (Crowd performing) MARK STRASSMANN: And nothing will return soon to the way it was like Saturday's commencement at the Air Force Academy. Graduates sitting apart, the stadium empty, but they celebrated progress. The event wasn't canceled. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: America's reopened economy will have winners and many losers, and thousands of small businesses were counting on the government's loan program. And now, it has run out of money. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann, thank you. We want to go now to CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer in London. ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@elizapalmer): Margaret, from China to Denmark, we are seeing governments around the world start to ease restrictions as they think they have the virus under control, but there are other countries which were slower to react that are getting hammered, notably, Russia. (Begin VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: At midnight in Moscow's cathedral, the great bell tolled to mark Orthodox Easter. But it was a solemn service. The Kremlin's strict lockdown only imposed in early April came too late. The line of ambulances waiting to get patients into the hospital tells a grim story: ten thousand confirmed new cases this weekend alone. By contrast, Greeks, who also celebrated Orthodox Easter from the safety of their living rooms, are giving thanks. Swift government action there achieved some of the lowest infection and death rates in Europe. Iran's outbreak, one of the most severe anywhere, swamped its hospitals. This week the powerful Revolutionary Guards claimed they'd invented a magnetic device to detect the virus at a hundred yards. Health officials quickly poured cold water on the idea, but it left Iranians weary, worried, and with even less confidence in their government. And, finally, a story to warm hearts everywhere: World War II veteran, Captain Tom Moore, set out to mark his hundredth birthday by crossing his garden a hundred times. His goal: to raise twelve hundred dollars for British health charities. Donations poured in. TOM MOORE: The sun will shine on you again and the clouds will go away. ELIZABETH PALMER: By the time Capitan Tom was finished with a military honor guard-- MAN: Inches to go, and there he is. ELIZABETH PALMER: --he had raised more than sixteen million dollars. MAN: Well done. (End VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: Here in the U.K., we've had our fairly comprehensive lockdown extended until at least the seventh of May. But here and there across Europe, governments are taking the first tentative steps to reopen businesses, everything from construction sites and bookshops, to hairdressers. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz Palmer in London. Thanks. CBS News foreign correspondent Ramy Inocencio has been reporting on this story from Asia since the first cases in Wuhan. He reports now from Tokyo. (Begin VT) RAMY INOCENCIO (CBS News Foreign Correspondent/@RamyInocencio): On China's border with Russia, this new six-hundred-bed hospital is prepped for a surge of imported cases. Ninety percent of China's infections have been citizens returning home from abroad. Many through this now locked down border town of Suifenhe. U.S. political pressure on China is also rising. President trump saying he will freeze funding to the World Health Organization. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're paying them more than ten times more than China. And they are very, very China-centric. TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS: WHO is reviewing the impact of our work of any withdrawal of U.S. funding. RAMY INOCENCIO: In terms of a second surge, are you nervous right now? DR. JEROME KIM: I am nervous. RAMY INOCENCIO: Doctor Jerome Kim is a leading epidemiologist in South Korea. DR. JEROME KIM: It's like putting out a fire. There are going to be embers that are glowing or smoking. You want to stamp those out before the fire starts again. RAMY INOCENCIO: With drive-through testing and a decisive government, South Korea has been praised as the global gold standard. Social distancing at the polls for parliamentary elections was the norm Wednesday, with temperature checks, hand sanitizer, and plastic gloves, all part of the process. The ruling party won an historic majority for flattening Korea's infection curve. DR. JEROME KIM: Testing and, you know, isolation made the response better. RAMY INOCENCIO: But to the opposite, in Japan, where Tokyo's busy streets have gone quiet. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared the whole nation under a state of emergency Thursday, one day after Japan's health ministry warned four hundred thousand people could die with no mitigation. (End VT) RAMY INOCENCIO: Japan is now scrambling to expand testing with drive-through facilities, like in South Korea. Contact tracing is a major concern, too. Here in the capital, more than seventy percent of all infections are of unknown origin. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ramy Inocencio in Tokyo. Thank you. We turn now to Doctor Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. Doctor Birx, good morning to you, and thank you for making time for us. DEBORAH BIRX, M.D. (White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Here in the U.S., what is the next area that you are concerned about? DEBORAH BIRX: We watch every single metro county in a very granular, granular way because you have to look at it that way. We're a series of small epidemics across the United States. We're still very much focused on Boston and across Massachusetts where the epidemic's continued to spread across Massachusetts as well as in Boston. And we're watching very closely Chicago. And then we watch every single outbreak that occurs in-- in different states around the-- around the United States, including the most recent one in Ohio. MARGARET BRENNAN: Here in Washington, there are projections that the virus couldn't peak until June. Obviously, this-- this is the heart of the nation's government. So what is your projection for what the impact here will be? DEBORAH BIRX: You know it's very interesting, as I-- I described, we're a series of independent curves. So, obviously, we all know that the New York metro area had-- had the most cases and the most explosive experience with the virus. And then we looked to Seattle that has been containing the virus and contact-tracing and really finding a series of small outbreaks. Having that first nursing home outbreak really helped them really put in public health measures that-- that's kept their curve very low. And so when the curves are low, it's much more difficult to predict when the curves are going to fully decline. And so we're learning a lot about-- it's easier actually in explosive epidemics. When you look at New Orleans, who went up very high and quickly back down, and we're trying to learn from each of the areas in the country so we can do the prediction that you're asking for. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We'll watch for that. But policy-wise, Doctor, why isn't there a national strategy for both testing and tracing? Why not provide those guidelines to governors? DEBORAH BIRX: So, we did do that through the new guidelines. So-- and it clearly shows that there are three ways we want to monitor this virus community by community. The first way is really understanding ER visit and the symptoms associated with COVID-19. And we're tracking and tracing those every day all across the country. The second way is really understanding influenza like illness and converting that entire surveillance program and monitoring program to COVID-like illness, which we can throughout the summer months because we don't have flu. And the third critical leg with those other two legs is testing, but testing needs to be focused critically where you start to see early evidence because no test is a hundred percent specific and a hundred percent sensitive. And so if you test and over test in areas where there isn't virus-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. DEBORAH BIRX: --you can end up with false positives and false negatives. MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- but I'm sure you know that governors, including the governor of New York, have said that they need more guidance from the federal government and sourcing for completing those tests. The vice president said today there's about a hundred and fifty thousand tests being conducted right now in the United States. Harvard projects you need five hundred to seven hundred thousand a day to reopen by mid-May. How-- how long before we get there? DEBORAH BIRX: So, I think because we're making national numbers with epidemics that are smaller, each of these epidemics will have a different testing need. And that's what we're calculating now. The numbers originally said that we only needed seven hundred, excuse me, seven hundred and fifty thousand tests a week. We've long since passed that. The new number coming from Harvard is the half a million a day. What we're trying to do is look at this in a very data driven, granular scientific methodologies to protect community by community the testing that is needed. At the same time, working with every laboratory director across the country that have these multiple platforms to really understand and find solutions for them on their issues related to supplies. MARGARET BRENNAN: Two weeks ago, you said Americans still shouldn't go to the pharmacy or grocery store. You've said just the other day we shouldn't have dinner parties still. What is the moment that we are in what is safe? DEBORAH BIRX: So, again, this has to be looked at as a community by community. And I am trying to really drive Americans to a website that I think is really quite extraordinary. If you go to the Florida public health website on COVID, they've been able to show their communities cases and tests district by district, county by county, zip code by zip code-- zip code. That's the kind of knowledge and power we need to put into the hands of American people so that they can see where the virus is, where the cases are and make decisions. The one thing I have been so impressed with, if you give Americans knowledge, they will translate that into protective actions that protect themselves and their community. And so we have to really get them information in a much more granular way than a national way or even a state way. It needs to be down to the communities so the communities can see what happens in their communities and make decisions with the local and health officials and the state officials, what can be opened and what needs to remain closed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor, scientifically speaking, could this outbreak just be the result of a lab accident? DEBORAH BIRX: You know anytime we have a new virus it's important to figure out its origins. And I think we're still a long way from figuring it out. It took us decades to figure out HIV and Ebola. It's going to take us a while to really map and trace this-- this particular virus, map it through its experience in humans and get the scientific evidence of where this virus originated. We know it originated in China. We just don't know, specifically, how and where. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're-- it sounds like you're saying it could have been. DEBORAH BIRX: I don't have an evidence that it was a laboratory accident. I also don't know precisely where it originated. So until we have the concrete evidence which we struggled with, with other pandemics and other zoonotic events. These are zoonotic events. They come from animals into humans. And so figuring that out will be really critical as well as figuring out could it have happened in the lab. Right now, the general consensus is animal to human. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the fact that South Korea is starting to see a bit of a resurgence mean that that could happen here in the U.S., that if you get this virus, you are not immune? DEBORAH BIRX: You know that's a different question. And we're-- that's why these studies that are going on with plasma and giving plasma to sick patients to really see if that antibody confers protective immunity and help to the individual who is sick, as well as really doing studies with vaccines and looking, seeing whether the antibodies that are produced are effective. These are questions that we still have scientifically. I will tell you, in most infectious diseases, except for HIV, we know that when you get sick and you recover and you develop antibody, that that antibody is often confers immunity. We just don't know if it's immunity for a month, immunity for six months, immunity for six years. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Birx, thank you for your time. DEBORAH BIRX, M.D.: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Boston and Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker. Good morning to you, Governor. GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER (R-Massachusetts/@MassGovernor): Good morning. How are you? MARGARET BRENNAN: Very well. And as we just heard from Doctor Birx, she is very concerned about what's happening in your state, which is experiencing such an outbreak right now. I want to ask you about how states are working with the federal government, because the President said this week he has the ultimate authority to make the decision to reopen. That same day, you and a number of governors throughout the Northeast announced you're going to come up with your own regional strategy. The White House has now said, okay, you're in charge of it anyhow. Did-- do these mixed messages impact your planning? Do you as a governor need more federal guidance? GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: Well, I guess the first thing I'd say is part of the reason we chose to join that collaborative is there's a tremendous amount of cross-border activity that takes place when there is a functioning economy between and among all those states in the Northeast. We have people who work in those states. We have people who live in those states and work in Massachusetts. We have tons of companies that do business back and forth. And I think us thinking about this regionally is an important element because I don't want Massachusetts to do something that makes life incredibly complicated for New York or New Jersey or New Hampshire or Vermont. And I certainly don't want them to do something that unwittingly creates issues and problems in Massachusetts. I think, generally, the-- the biggest thing we're interested in guidance from the feds on is a lot of the stuff that comes out of the CDC and the FDA, which we take very seriously and incorporate into our own guidance and our own advisories and in some cases orders that we issue in Massachusetts. I know that's true for many other states. I also think the other issue that's important from the feds is-- is they approve and drive a lot of the policy and what ultimately becomes sort of the facts on the ground with respect to testing and treatments. And-- and as-- in a state where there are a number of companies that are deeply invested in either the development of treatments or vaccines or have hospitals that are involved in clinical trials associated with treatments for COVID-19, the federal government's role with respect to treatments is enormously important. And on the testing piece-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, do you need a national strategy? GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: --they fundamentally have a huge role to play. MARGARET BRENNAN: For testing? GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: Pardon me? MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need that national strategy for testing? GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: I think, generally speaking, governors appreciate the fact that the feds have acknowledged that the surge is in different places and different states at different times. We're in a very different place here in Massachusetts than other states are. We're right in the middle of the surge now. But I certainly believe that the more guidance and-- and expec-- especially the ability to put the foot on the accelerator with respect to advancements in testing-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: --everything associated with testing ultimately has to be approved by the CDC and the FDA. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: As it should be. The states shouldn't be making their own decisions on that stuff. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one decision you have made in your state is to launch contact-tracing. You're getting that program still up and running. GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: Yep. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're doing it with phone calls. You're about to hire about a thousand people to do it. Explain what the idea is. GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: So there's an organization in Massachusetts called Partners in Health, which has been doing work in developing countries around public health for years. And-- and they are, in my opinion, kind of the gold standard around contact-tracing generally. And they've been doing it in-- in places where Ebola and Zika become horrible epidemics and outbreaks. And they started talking to us about creating a contact tracing program in Massachusetts. And, first of all, it's not theoretical. They've done it before. They know how to do it. Secondly, I absolutely believe that, in Massachusetts, any way, for us to get back on our feet and start thinking about reopening, we have got to have better knowledge and better understanding and support for people who are dealing with this virus and those they've come in close contact with-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But why do it-- GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: --and this is going to be a big initiative. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do it the old-fashioned way of-- of phone calls? Couldn't it happen more quickly if you did it digitally? GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: Well, I certainly think that there's going to be a role for a variety of digital interventions to support this. I don't think it's an either or. I think it's a both and. But just based on this stuff we started doing already, there's tremendous value in having conversations with people who are COVID-19 positive, not just in terms of who they've been in contact with, but also what it's going to take to help them stay isolated and, you know, manage their way through the-- the virus themselves. And when we have a thousand people working this, and it may be more than that over time, the goal here is to push back on the virus the same way they did in South Korea, to contain it, understand where it is, and control it. And I think it's going to be critical for every state that wants to get open and back to something like a new normal to put some kind of mechanism like this in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now there is this struggle in Congress and with the White House about how much money to give to states and if it should be included in this upcoming package. Does Massachusetts need more federal funding? I know governors in a bipartisan group said they need about five hundred billion dollars in unrestricted aid. GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: Well, the big issue for states is not dissimilar to the one you see for municipalities and other entities, which is if you shut down the economy, you shut down the revenue stream. But that doesn't mean you're no longer in the business of providing health care for people. You're not out of the business of operating correctional facilities. You're not going to get out of the public safety business or the environmental protection business or the transportation business. But I think every state in the country is struggling with what the hit to their economy has done to their balance sheet and to their budgets. And if the feds are interested in sort of reopening the economy and they've certainly talked-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: --a lot about the importance of stimulating the economy going forward. For states to be able to support that initiative-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: --obviously, it's important for the feds to support our efforts to-- to fund the stuff we do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: If we're laying off tens of thousands of people at exactly the time when they want to reopen the economy, we're going to be swimming against the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: --the current they're trying to create. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be watching for that. Governor, thank you for your time. We'll be right back. GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER: Thank you. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Joining us now to help us educate our viewers about new COVID-19 developments is former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He joins us from his home in Connecticut. Good morning to you. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm wondering, we heard from Doctor Birx and then we heard from the governor of Massachusetts. I know you've also been advising him. There's a lot of concern about Boston and Chicago, Birx said. What are the other areas of the country that you still see as very worrisome? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think when you look at the Southeast and the Sun Belt, you still need to be worried. You haven't seen cases really spike in Texas or Georgia. In fact, it looks like cases are slowing there. But there's parts of those states where that are hot spots, counties that are moving very quickly. Parts of the Panhandle in Florida, you see cases growing very quickly. So the parts of the country that were later to enter their epidemic portion of this crisis, I think still are going to come out of it later. And you still have to be concerned about that. And-- and really any part of the country is vulnerable, even rural parts of the country, saw that with South Dakota. Once a case gets into a situation where you have people tightly packed indoors, it can spread very quickly. You see these super-spreader situations, as you saw in South Dak-- Dakota. So I don't think anyone's out of the woods right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are seeing some governors start talking about and opening up things like beaches in Florida, parts of that state. You heard Doctor Birx say that there is, in fact, a national strategy from-- for testing. Do you think that strategy is adequate? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think it's a loose strategy. I think states are largely on their own trying to get testing resources into their states. And I think one of the things they should be doing right now is trying to work together, at least on a regional basis, to move around samples, to take advantage of capacity for testing that exists in a regional location within the country. Where we need a national strategy, first and foremost, is on the testing supply chain. So all the cheap, low-commodity components that go into testing like the swabs and the reagents and we've been talking about this for weeks now, those are all in short supply. We don't have shortages of them. But whatever gets produced is getting consumed because it's a global supply chain that testing sites are tugging on. And so if you had the government more engaged in trying to manage that supply chain, getting supplies to the states that need it most and trying to look for ways to increase manufacturing at a national level, that could help the states get the supplies they need. It's not the testing platforms per se that are in short supply. A lot of states have testing capacity within the states. It's the components to run those tests that they're having trouble getting their hands on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and-- and Doctor Birx said that that there is an attempt to try to help the states. What's missing there? What kind of coordination does there need to be between states and labs and the federal government? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think the federal government has more capacity to try to tug on that global supply chain, get more supplies into the country while other countries are competing for the same supplies. And also look at how we ramp up manufacturing of these-- these components. These are low-commodity components. There's a lot of plastic parts that could be 3D printed. There might be ways to increase manufacturing in the United States. It's something that we should be looking at trying to do if we can bring on manufacturing sites that can make some of these things here domestically-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --both in the near term and the long term. Right now the swing capacity in the market, if we're going to see dramatic increases in capacity coming into the market in May and June, it's going to be from new systems coming into the market. The point of care diagnostic systems like the Abbott machine that we've seen or the Cepheid GeneXpert, those companies are probably going to increase their supply of the machines that they have available and there's a couple of other companies awaiting approval with the FDA or authorization to come into the market. And now probably-- probably be the inflection point if we're likely to see one, at least in May and June. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said employers should look at things like onsite testing before their employees return to work. Do you think that's something that governors should mandate companies to have? What co-- corporation is going to spend the money unless they are required to do so? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. I don't think there's should be a mandate because there's a lot of corporations that are going to have difficulty bringing this onsite. I think where the government can play a role is helping to subsidize these activities in the near term so that we can make sure it's available not just to white-collar jobs and offices, but also shop floors and factories where there's actually more risk to employees because they can't naturally social distance or helping small businesses come together and put machines in local communities because they are going to have a hard time doing this. You're going to see a lot of office-based jobs actually bring testing onsite. I'm talking to a lot of companies that are actively working on this right now. And you're going to see provider groups step in to provide those facilities to companies. And what I worry about is it's not going to be available to all employees and employees who are most at risk of contracting COVID at work because they can't naturally social distance are the ones who aren't going to have access to these facilities. And so I think states have a role to play in helping to democratize these kinds of technologies so that more employees can take advantage of them. MARGARET BRENNAN: And does that mean expanding the health care requirement, the paid leave policies that expire under current legislation in December? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah. Look, I-- I have a letter I'm working on with a bunch of public health officials, a bipartisan group making recommendations to Congress to look at ways to provide paid sick leave to people who have diagnosed COVID so that they can self-isolate at home, as well as provide money to people who are self-isolating at home awaiting a test result. You don't want getting a positive COVID-19 test result to be punitive. You don't want to tell people they have to self-isolate at home. And, oh, by the way, they are going to lose wages and they are going to incur other expenses and hardships. So while you don't want to make it something that's fin-- and a financial inducement to get coronavirus, you also don't want to make it punitive. And we have to balance that. We have to find that happy medium. And that means, I think, providing for lost wages and maybe providing a stipend, a small stipend to people similar to what we do when they serve on jury duty because there are costs that people are going to incur by self-isolating at home if they have a coronavirus illness. And as a society, we're going to want them to do that. That's how we're going to stop the spread. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, very quickly, how close are we to some kind of treatment or a vaccine and is China going to beat us there? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There's a risk that China may get to a vaccine first. I don't think their Adenoviral vector vaccine is very good, but they may get it to the market before we do. I think that is a concern. In terms of the vaccine here in the United States, we may have hundreds of thousands of doses available in the fall for testing. And if there is an outbreak, a big outbreak in an American city, I think it would be made available in that city in some-- under some kind of protocol. So we would have it available in this setting of an outbreak, certainly not a national epidemic like we have right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.  SCOTT GOTTLIEB: We may have one or more treatments by the fall. I don't think anyone's going to be a home run, but we may have something that can help. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Gottlieb, thank you very much, as always, for your insight. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a look at the financial fallout from the coronavirus crisis. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and the continued financial fallout from the coronavirus. Suzanne Clark is the president of the Chamber of Commerce based here in Washington. Good morning. SUZANNE CLARK (President, U.S. Chamber of Commerce/@SuzanneUSCC): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: The volume, the amount of demand that small businesses had for emergency aid was so great that that three-hundred-and-fifty-billion-dollar fund ran out on Thursday. We know from congressional leaders and the Treasury that they expect some kind of deal to replenish those funds. Is two hundred and fifty billion dollars enough? SUZANNE CLARK: Well, we know that the small businesses out there are really hurting. And every hour and day that goes by without this assistance is really hurting them. And so we know that it's a really good start; and it's part of why we are working on a path forward on how you reopen businesses so that they can get back in some kind of gradual, phased-in way to work. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do believe this two-hundred-fifty-billion-dollar package will be approved this week. But, I mean a senior Fed official I spoke to this week said even the two hundred and fifty on top of the three hundred and fifty billion may not be enough because small businesses are in such acute pain and they make up such an important part of the U.S. economy. I mean what's the timeline? SUZANNE CLARK: I think the two hundred and fifty billion dollars is just another really important step on getting aid to the front lines as fast as possible. I do think it will get done this week, and the Chamber is delighted about that. What we really believe, though, to your point, is that these businesses in getting paychecks in the hands of Americans at some point requires getting back to work, of course, safely and sustainably when the public health officials say it's okay to do so. MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to your members, how many of them had a hard time getting access to this money? Because CBS, in our reporting at this net-- network, has found that many of the smaller businesses didn't get their applications through. SUZANNE CLARK: We know that there was great demand because we know that there's great pain out there. We know that the banks, you know, this didn't make different banking regulations go away. So they had to deal with people they knew bus-- did business with. They had to deal with anti-money laundering rules, etcetera. So it was easier to do business with people that they knew. But we know now, as other non-traditional lenders get into this space, that they are ready to give the money and make it easier for small businesses to access as soon as that fund is replenished. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you expect it to function better-- SUZANNE CLARK: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --this time? SUZANNE CLARK: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Chamber released a poll showing at the beginning of April that one out of ten members say they are less than one month away from permanently going out of business. What are your projections on bankruptcies and closures? SUZANNE CLARK: It's really terrifying these numbers. You had something like fifty percent of small businesses say that they were eight weeks away from closing forever. And so that's why these bridge programs are so important; but also why it's so important that we start to think about reopening in a gradual, phased-in way. We know that certain regions were hit harder than others. We also know that there were certain regions that weren't hit as hard. We know that certain sectors, as Doctor Gottlieb just said, will have a harder time coming back. But there are other sectors that may be able to open. So the faster that we can get people back to work-- we know what this job means to a community and to a family, and the faster we can get paychecks into their hands and get these businesses to open the sharper and faster the recovery will be. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is the cost to a small business owner of trying to provide and what is the legal expectation for that small business owner to try to provide testing or protective equipment to their employees? Are you telling businesses to go ask their governors and mayors or is that the business owner's job? SUZANNE CLARK: That's exactly where we're doing our work. So the Chamber's path forward is all about gathering all of the questions and concerns that small, medium, and large businesses across the country have and helping develop a framework for policymakers and businesses so that when we get the yellow light, the proceed with caution light, to reopen, they are ready. And you're right, that that's part tracing and testing. But it's also part, which equipment and how do you train? And then there's the best practices and guidelines. Are we asking employers to check whether you've been tested? Are we creating some kind of immune registry? There are a lot of regulatory and legal questions here that small business owners and big business owners want to know. There's no playbook for this. It's unprecedented. And they want to know if they take a risk in an imperfect information situation that they are going to be protected. MARGARET BRENNAN: And who is answering those questions? Is that the federal government? SUZANNE CLARK: It's really a coordinated approach. You have federal guidelines that then have to be implemented on a state and local level because the conditions vary so much by zip code. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, very quickly, before we leave, can I get you to clarify--do you expect the requirement to provide health care coverage, paid leave to happen because it currently expires in December? SUZANNE CLARK: I don't know what the Congress will end up deciding. What I expect is that companies and communities are going to do the right thing by their people. We don't want sick people in the workplace. We can't get back to work until we get back to health. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SUZANNE CLARK: And I expect that the government and business will work together to figure that out. MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot of big questions still unanswered. Thank you very much, Suzanne Clark. SUZANNE CLARK: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Of the populations most vulnerable to a COVID-19 outbreak, the world's twenty-six million refugees are at the top of that list. They often live in close quarters with access to only basic health and sanitation facilities. An outbreak of the virus could be devastating. The country of Jordan is home to at least three and a half million refugees and also the world's largest Syrian refugee camp. We are joined now by the King of Jordan, His Majesty King Abdullah II. Good morning to you, Your Majesty. HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH II OF JORDAN (@KingAbdullahII): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Social distancing is next to impossible for-- for refugees. How do you plan it-- to limit the spread? HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH II OF JORDAN: Well, we acted quite early on, and that helped us flatten the curve quite-- quite well. And we created obviously some tough measures and-- and lockdown and-- and-- and quarantines over the whole country, although we're in the process of opening that up slightly. The challenge with refugees, obviously, they're about twenty percent of our population. The majority are not in refugee camps. So that is a challenge but we sort of treat every person inside of our borders, whether you're a Jordanian citizen or a refugee, in the same manner. Excessive testing has helped us figure out what our challenges are. But definitely, a country with a twenty-percent increase of its population through refugees, it's a major challenge as we go into the future. MARGARET BRENNAN: So given that not all refugees live in camps, what kind of sense do you have of the degree to which the virus has penetrated that community? HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH II OF JORDAN: Well, again, we-- we do random and targeted testing throughout the whole country. Refugee camps, because, obviously, people are much closer together in living conditions, was something that we looked at earlier on. So there is a lot of testing. The lockdown on the quarantine has helped Jordan sort of flatten the curve quite quickly. The cases that we've had over the past week are under the-- under ten people every day. We average fifteen give or take on a-- on a-- on a-- on a-- on a weekly basis. So it seems that we're-- we've got things under control and within the capabilities of our medical and health establishments. But, again, there's always that question out there: is there a gap in society that you don't know of? And so, again, testing at a massive scale is-- is how we're relying on, hopefully, getting the right figures. MARGARET BRENNAN: This pandemic is global and the U.N. has called for a global response. But, frankly, Europe is struggling with this virus. The United States is. The U.S. President just cut funding or froze it, at least, to the World Health Organization. Who do you see actually leading a global response? HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH II OF JORDAN: Well, I-- I think this is a challenge that took everybody by surprise, by the impact and the magnitude of-- of this pandemic. And I think the question is nobody is going to get a perfect score on this issue. Each country has different ways of handling it, nuances of their societies and-- and what their country faces. The question that I think you're alluding to is where are we four months, six months, a year from now? Do we understand that this is a-- a new world that we're living in? This is a disease that, or a virus, that crosses borders. It's an invisible enemy. It will target developed countries, undeveloped countries, whatever your religion, creed, color, or race. Unless we work together, we will not be able to overcome this in the way that we need to. So our enemies of yesterday or-- or those that were not friendly countries yesterday, whether we like it or not are our partners today. And I think the quicker we as leaders and politicians figure that out the quicker we can bring this under control because it's not just COVID-19 that we're worried about. It's what does it bring for us on the world in 2021, '22, '23? Are we going to be prepared for the next wave of this? And that could only happen if we reach out to each other. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the IMF has said that if countries don't handle this right, that the virus could destabilize countries, in particular, because of the economic strain. Are you worried about instability in Jordan? Are you worried that this could be exploited by extremist groups? HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH II OF JORDAN: Well, I think all over the world extremist groups and the usual suspects will, obviously, try and take advantage of that. We as a country that have come out of the-- the regional shocks of-- of wars with a massive surge of refugees that we've had, plus, being a poor country on a very strict program with the IMF and trying to get the economy back and running, obviously, this is a major concern. Having said that, we have seen areas of our society where actually we can be supporters for the region. But it's, I think, a challenge that all countries are facing of whether or not we get the economics right. So here's the risk. I mean, obviously, we are now slowly, gradually opening up, understanding that it could really move us back a couple of paces. But I think with this type of challenge, we've got to be very light on our feet. So mistakes, I keep saying, that are made yesterday, as long as we get them right today and-- and keep our-- our institutions and our people flexible enough to be able to-- to-- to take on the challenges that we may not have foreseen tomorrow. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you spoken to the president of China or asked him for help? HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH II OF JORDAN: No, I-- I have not. I have been in touch with the leaders around the world. At the beginning, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the leader and my dear friend in the United Arab Emirates, he got in touch with me and asked what could he do to help. And, again, we had a problem with test kits. Jack Ma of Alibaba gave us a hundred thousand test kits that almost tripled our capability overnight. Many individuals and countries have helped us as we have in turn been helping them. And this is, I think, the flavor I hope that people will get. I mean, to be really honest, Mother Nature gave us a big kick up the backside. And are we smart enough as-- as a race and as a people to understand that we've got to get it right and-- and do we now serve humanity in the right way to be able to make sure that everybody is looked after because those that have not are going to suffer as much as those that have. And if we don't reach out to those that are in need, even though, we may have limited resources, it is at this stage doing what's right to help all of us because we're all in the same boat. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your Majesty, thank you for your time. HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH II OF JORDAN: Thank you very much, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Finally today, with the nation's governors becoming familiar faces to all of us, regardless of where we live, thanks to technology, we asked 60 MINUTES correspondent John Dickerson for his thoughts on the crucial role they're playing in this crisis. (Begin VT) JOHN DICKERSON: While the medical laboratories search for a coronavirus cure, the laboratories of democracy are also hard at work. That's the phrase Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis used to describe the fifty American states. The political scientists in these laboratories are the governors, facing the toughest issues of the virus. From overburdened hospitals and equipment shortages-- CHARLIE BAKER: Our first responders, our health care workers, everybody deserves to have that gear and I'm telling you we're killing ourselves trying to make it happen. JOHN DICKERSON: --to exploding unemployment. ASA HUTCHINSON: our economic condition is uncertain, but the state of our character has never been stronger. JOHN DICKERSON: In their response, they have reminded us what leadership looks like, where its limits are, and how generously citizens respond to grace under pressure. In a crisis when there is no end date, people crave specificity and plain speaking, even if it's tough medicine. GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE (D-Washington): What's the penalty for a young person going out to a restaurant or hanging in a social get-together? And it's true the penalty is you might kill your grandparent. JOHN DICKERSON: Voters in a state may know their governor, but, usually, the rest of the country only tunes in when a disaster hits. Then the governor is the one in the windbreaker, standing behind the President surveying the damage. Now governors are center stage because the disaster in one state is the disaster facing every state. MAN: All these patients here. JOHN DICKERSON: When governors remind their constituents, they also remind the country, that we are all connected. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE (R-Ohio): We have to pull together, and, ultimately, it's going to be the small acts, what seems small, of each and every American that truly is going to make all the difference in the world. (Crowd cheering) JOHN DICKERSON: In an age of finger-pointing, blame-shifting and spin, it can be bracing to simply hear a leader take responsibility. GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO (D-New York): If you are upset by what we have done, be upset at me, my judgment is do whatever is necessary to contain this virus. And then we will manage the consequences afterwards. The old expression: The buck stops on my desk. The buck stops on my desk. Your local mayor did not close your restaurants, your bars, your gyms, or your schools. I did. I did. JOHN DICKERSON: Voters notice when leaders step up. Polls show that the governors in the states of California, New York, Ohio and Arkansas, have approval ratings in the seventies and eighties. State laboratories also showed the limits of what works. In Michigan, Governor Whitmer has rallied the public and won its approval, but recent strict stay-at-home orders caused a backlash, which in its responsible form reminded us that leaders can only do so much through coercion. Leaders identify a need, make a plan, and follow through. So this week, three sets of regional governors formed groups to think through the next phase in COVID-19 response that might boost economic output, relying on evidence, consultation, and persuasion. There's much work ahead. Because even when the medical laboratories find a solution, these laboratories will have to keep working. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll keep working, too. That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "Paris\u00a0\u2014 France's interior minister has called some of the images posted online of police clearing an illegal migrant camp in central Paris on Monday night \"shocking.\" Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has promised an investigation into accusations that officers were heavy-handed, tipping over tents, chasing people down streets and hitting protesters and journalists with truncheons. Darmanin, who is in charge of all France's police forces, tweeted Tuesday that the Paris police chief, Didier Lallement, had recommended calling in internal affairs inspectors over some of the actions taken by police, actions that he called \"unacceptable.\" He called for an investigation to be wrapped up in just 48 hours \u2014 and made public.\u00a0 Some 450 refugees, mostly from Afghanistan, had set up tents at the Place de la R\u00e9publique on Monday evening in protest of the clearing-out of a large migrant camp in the suburb of Saint-Denis a week ago. That clearance left scores of migrants with nowhere to sleep. Within an hour of it being set up, the Paris police chief ordered the illegal camp to be cleared, and when police moved in, it quickly turned violent.\u00a0 coucou #Darmanin on peut flouter ce croche pied? hier \u00e0 #Paris #Republique pic.twitter.com/qTt9yoS4Ni There were clashes with protesters, people who had been asleep were dragged from their tents, and police used tear gas and flash grenades to clear the square. Unverified videos posted online appeared to show police pushing and shoving refugees and activists, and reports of a policeman tripping up one person trying to flee have led to charges against an officer.\u00a0\u00a0 Opposition politicians denounced the \"savagery\" of the evacuation. French media reported that members of President Emmanuel Macron's own ruling centrist LREM party were voicing concern over the violence and the decision to move the migrants out without offering alternative shelter. The clear-out happened just ahead of a debate in the National Assembly on Tuesday over a proposed law that would make it illegal to broadcast images of police during an intervention. The proposal has provoked an outcry, with accusations of attempts to trample on press freedom. Police unions argue that their members are often filmed up close with smartphones by people who then post the video or photos on social media, with the names of the officers, and sometimes the names and addresses of their families. Journalists' unions are concerned that reporters could be arrested for trying to film an ongoing event, or for a live broadcast, when the faces of police officers cannot be blurred, as the legislation would require. The European Commission also weighed in on Monday, with a reminder that journalists should be able \"to do their work freely and in safety.\" On Tuesday afternoon, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said he would refer the bill to the country's Supreme Court for consideration, while defending what he called an \"excellent\" piece of legislation. Five years ago, far-right leader Marine Le Pen benefitted in the presidential election from a feeling of insecurity about immigrants, as polls suggested many French felt there were too many in the country. Le Pen lost then, but looks set to be President Macron's chief rival in next year's election. More recent polls, however, show softening views of migrants. Concern about insecurity linked to the presence of migrant camps has dropped sharply in recent years, and one poll suggested that French people consistently overestimate the actual number of migrants and refugees in the country.",

            "article_content": "Former President Obama in an interview\u00a0with\u00a0CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley\u00a0said he is troubled by the false claims of widespread election fraud in the United States. \"They appear to be motivated-- in part because-- the president doesn't like to lose and-- never admits loss,\" Mr. Obama said. \"I'm more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this, are humoring him in this fashion. It is one more step in delegitimizing not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy generally. And that's a dangerous path.\" The clip is a part of CBS News' exclusive pair of interviews with Mr. Obama. He will talk with\u00a0\"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King\u00a0for \"CBS Sunday Morning\" and Pelley for \"60 Minutes.\" These are his first television interviews following the 2020 presidential election and before the release of his new memoir, \"A Promised Land.\" Both interviews will air Sunday, November 15th on CBS News. Possibly some rest and maybe some relaxation is in store for President-elect Biden in the coming days as Thursday he headed down to his beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. Before he left, he spoke with Pope Francis, according to a readout from the call. \"The president-elect thanked His Holiness for extending blessings and congratulations and noted his appreciation for His Holiness' leadership in promoting peace, reconciliation, and the common bonds of humanity around the world,\" the readout stated, \"The president-elect expressed his desire to work together on the basis of a shared belief in the dignity and equality of all humankind on issues such as caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities.\" Advisers to President Trump tell\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0and\u00a0White House correspondents Paula Reid\u00a0and\u00a0Ben Tracy\u00a0the president has openly discussed the possibility of running in 2024 with his top advisors. While no decisions have been made, one Trump advisor familiar with conversations with the president tells CBS News Trump allies are actively working to keep his options open as they begin to plot his political future. As CBS News has previously reported, President Trump has created \"Save America\" leadership PAC, which was registered with the Federal Election Commission on Monday by Trump campaign treasurer Bradley Crate. Mr. Trump has given no indication to top brass at the White House or campaign that he will concede the race, though advisors increasingly admit it would be near impossible for Mr. Trump to contest the 2020 election. According to advisers to the president, the Trump campaign legal team remains focused on bringing Pennsylvania legal challenges back to the Supreme Court in hopes of granting the president a legal victory, even if it does not change the math nor the outcome of the 2020 election. This kind of win in the court of law would help the president prove this election was not fair in the court of public opinion, advisors tell CBS News, allowing the president to claim he was cheated of a second term. Two years after launching her non-profit, When We All Vote, former first lady Michelle Obama is reaping the reward. The organization announced Thursday it engaged over 100 million eligible voters during the course of the 2020 election cycle, reports\u00a0CBS News Correspondent Nikole Killion. That includes sending more than 15.3 million text messages to 7.3 million eligible voters and getting more than half a million individuals to start or complete the voter registration process. The group ran one of the largest nonpartisan voter registration and turnout efforts using a mix of digital organizing and innovative methods to reach people during the coronavirus pandemic. It held dozens of virtual events including a Couch Party series that featured celebrity figures from DJ D-Nice to the Duchess of Sussex. It also partnered with Lebron James' More Than A Vote for early vote events and 52 sports leagues and teams joined its coalition. \"We've got to promise each other that our focus in this election won't be an anomaly, but the rule,\"\u00a0Michelle Obama tweeted. She founded When We All Vote to increase voter participation and close the race and age gap among voters. \"That's how we can not only feel this way right now, but in the months and years ahead.\" The Trump campaign has sent no less than 190 emails to supporters soliciting donations since Election Day to fund the campaign's \"Election Defense Fund,\" reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. But that money is largely being funneled into Mr. Trump's new leadership PAC \"Save America\" and the Republican National Convention. Sixty percent of all online contributions under $5000 go to \"Save America\" leadership PAC, which was registered with the Federal Election Commission on Monday by Trump campaign treasurer Bradley Crate. \"President Trump has a significant degree of flexibility with how he could use his leadership PAC funds,\" Brendan Fischer, Director of Federal Reform at the Campaign Legal Center tells CBS News. \"He is subject to the $5,000 contribution limit and able to make up to $5,000 in contributions to another candidate. And that's what a leadership PAC is supposed to be used for - to support other candidates. But President Trump could also use leadership PAC to pay for rallies after he leaves the White House, it could pay for his travel. It could be used to pay for events held at Trump propertiest potentially could even be used to pay consulting fees to the President's family or the President himself.\" The campaign was running low on cash heading into Election Day and final FEC filings are expected to show it incurred significant debt. Meanwhile, advisers to Mr. Trump continue to tell CBS News' White House unit that there is no viable legal path to overturning the election results as the legal fight continues. Advisors do not expect the Supreme Court to intervene, and tell CBS News that Mr. Trump - who likes to be perceived as a \"fighter\" - has become increasingly aware of his prospects. NextGen America founder and former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer told reporters on Thursday that Mr. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris \"would not have won without the youth vote.\" NextGen America mobilizes voters between the ages 18-35 across the country and spent nearly $60 million this cycle on efforts to engage young voters. The organization, with a presence on over 200 college campuses, said it registered over 120,000 young voters and collected more than 441,000 pledges to vote, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. NextGen's Executive Director Ben Wessel said the organization ran its \"largest program ever\" by working in 11 key battleground states to increase turnout and persuade young voters to support Biden. Steyer and Wessel said younger voters supported Biden in large numbers because of his climate agenda. \"Some of those people who had unfavorable opinions of Joe Biden we know are lefty progressive young people,\" Wessel said. \"Coming out of the primary, Biden was in a tough spot with some of these folks,\" he added. Wessel went on to explain that NextGen communicated to voters a message that said Biden is \"listening to progressives\" like Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on climate change. That helped in building enthusiasm for Biden among young voters, Wessel added. Other youth climate change activist groups like Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement are already calling on Mr. Biden to create a White House Office of Mobilization to focus specifically on climate change and nominate Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sanders to top cabinet posts. \"Whether they can carry out the specific platform that they ran on given the political circumstances of the day is obviously questionable,\" Steyer said, adding that progressive legislation on climate change might be difficult if Republicans end up with control of the Senate. \"But I am confident that the Biden-Harris administration will pursue the values and goals that were the subject of their platform and they have to because young people are going to be watching,\" Steyer added. The Trump campaign's suit in Arizona over so-called \"overvote\" ballots they believe went uncounted in the battleground state's largest county went before a state judge Thursday, as Republicans seek to force Maricopa County election officials to manually hand count these votes over concerns they say their supporters' ballots were incorrectly rejected by poll workers. Their opponents in court, state and local election officials, have decried the suit as little more than a \"repackaged\" version of the\u00a0debunked conspiracy theory\u00a0that the use of Sharpies at polling sites invalidated votes. And though Mr. Biden currently has a slim lead among the latest results out of Arizona's latest tally, county attorneys say the pool of so-called \"overvotes\" in question total less than 200 -- far short of the president-elect's some 10,000 vote margin in Arizona over Mr. Trump. \"It has become clear that Plaintiffs are pursuing these claims solely to sow confusion and undermine the democratic process,\" attorneys for Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat,\u00a0argued in a filing\u00a0released Thursday ahead of the hearing, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. With less than a week before the deadline for Pennsylvania's top elections official to certify the state's election results, lawyers for the Trump campaign today asked a federal court judge to issue a temporary order keeping her from doing so. Lawyers for Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar wrote in a motion asking for dismissal that the Trump campaign's claims, \"lack standing to pursue their claims, which constitute mere generalized grievances and which rest upon conjectural theories of supposed harm requiring multiple leaps of logic.\" Representing the Trump campaign, Philadelphia attorney Linda Kerns told District Court Judge Matthew Brann -- in a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to stop the certification -- that the measure was necessary to allow the court time to rule on a range of alleged voting irregularities and claims that the campaign was unable to properly monitor vote counting. On Monday, Kerns had asked the judge injunctive relief, but was not immediately granted it. The DNC has also asked the judge to dismiss the case. Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Monday in Williamsport. Also in Pennsylvania today, a Commonwealth Court judge ruled that mail and absentee voters who verified their proof of identification after November 9 but by November 12 will not have their votes counted. Ruling in favor of the Trump campaign, Judge Mary Hannah Levitt wrote that Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar \"lacked statutory authority\" to direct counties to extend the deadline for such corrections. Such ballots have not yet been included in current tallies and the order will therefore not lessen Mr. Biden's lead on Mr. Trump in the state, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. As of Thursday morning, 55 of Wisconsin's 72 counties have completed their election canvassing process, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC).\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0reports counties have until November 17 to finish their canvassing and it's expected some counties may not finish until that date. Counties have been preparing for a possible recount, but the Trump campaign can't request one until all counties have turned in their certified results. Mr. Trump trails Mr. Biden by more than 20,000 votes in Wisconsin and CBS News has projected Biden won the state. WEC Administrator Meagan Wolfe told reporters on Thursday that there have not been any significant changes to results during canvassing so far. A recount is also highly unlikely to change the statewide results. The 2016 recount added about 130 votes to Mr. Trump's margin of victory over Hillary Clinton. If the Trump campaign requests a recount, they would have to pay the estimated costs up front. Green Party candidate Jill Stein paid $3.5 million before the 2016 recount but was ultimately refunded about $1.5 million of that amount. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that Democratic candidate Rita Hart is planning to\u00a0file a recount request\u00a0in the race for Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, where she trails Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks by only 48 votes. The request comes after two counties reported tabulation errors in the past week. Iowa's election code says the recount must be completed within 18 days of each county board's canvass, which will be November 27 or 28, dependent on the county. In New York's 11th, Democrat incumbent Max Rose has conceded to Republican Nicole Malliotakis. \"As we continue to count every ballot and are on track to dramatically narrow the gap by tens of thousands of votes to a 4-5 point margin, it is now clear that we will fall short of 50.1%,\" Rose said in a statement. This will be the ninth Democrat incumbent to be unseated by a Republican this cycle, and the tenth flip for the House GOP overall. Malliotakis will also be the 27th Republican woman to be elected to the House, surpassing the record of 25 set in 2006.",

            "article_content": "Amman\u00a0\u2014 Jordanians headed to the polls Tuesday to vote in parliamentary elections, but even as they cast their ballots, American democracy was weighing just as heavily on many minds. Economics student Sanaa Mohammed told CBS News that, while she felt it was important for her vote in Jordan, the U.S. election has \"far reaching effects\" on the Arab world.\u00a0 \"We all follow the news in America,\" she said after voting at a polling station in central Amman. \"I am so happy that Biden won.\" Jordan's King Abdullah II was quick to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden after the race was called by CBS News and other major media outlets on Saturday.  \"I look forward to working with you on further advancing the solid historic partnership between Jordan and the United States,\" he said in a Tweet. Congratulations to President-Elect @JoeBiden and VP-Elect @KamalaHarris. I look forward to working with you on further advancing the solid historic partnership between Jordan and the United States, in the interest of our shared objectives of peace, stability and prosperity pic.twitter.com/Q5qN565nGa That \"historic partnership\" has been strained in recent years. Jordan opposed the Middle East peace plan offered by the Trump administration, as well as its decision to freeze U.S. contributions to UNRWA, the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees, of whom Jordan hosts about 2 million \u2014 more than any other nation.\u00a0 \"The Trump administration treated Jordan as collateral damage,\" Dr. Marwan Muasher, a former Jordanian foreign minister who is now the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment. He predicted that \"the new president is going to spend most of his time either on domestic issues or, when it comes to international issues, on repairing the gap with the Europeans and having that new relationship with China.\"\u00a0 Muasher said he believes, however, that while the Middle East may rank low on the new administration's priority list, \"a Biden administration is better for Jordan.\" \"What we will see immediately is the ditching of the Trump plan and probably the restoration of aid to UNRWA and restarting contacts with the Palestinians. But beyond that, I don't think we will see much,\" added Muasher, who also served as Jordan's ambassador to Israel. The Palestinian Authority was quick to welcome the news from the U.S., with President Mahmoud Abbas expressing hope of renewed ties under President-elect Biden. Three years ago, Abbas cut off all direct contact with President Trump's White House after the U.S. officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. Embassy to the holy city. \"We don't expect a miraculous transformation, but at least we expect the dangerous, destructive policies of Trump to totally stop,\" Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's Executive Committee, told the Reuters news agency. \"They should change course and deal with the Palestinian question on the bases of legality, equality and justice, and not on the basis of responding to special interests of pro-Israeli lobbies.\" \u00a0 The Arab Opinion Index poll, published last month by the Qatar-based Arab Center for Research and Public Policy, found that \"81% [of Arabs] believe that the United States poses a threat to the security and stability of the region.\"  According to the pan-Arab opinion poll, the U.S. came a close second in that ranking after Israel, with Iran a distant third. \"Now there is a sense of relief that Trump has lost,\" Dr. Mohammed Al Masri, Director of the Arab Opinion Index, told CBS News.  He said that with the change of administration, the perception of the U.S. in the Arab world would almost certainly change, at least in the short term.  \"This hopeful immediate reaction will be revisited in a few months,\" he cautioned, \"based on the implemented policies of Biden.\"\u00a0 The Arab world is far from monolithic, and other leaders in the region might not be as optimistic as the Palestinians, or the King of Jordan.\u00a0 Egypt's military-backed President Abdul Fatah el-Sissi was the first Arab leader to congratulate Mr. Biden, but he is fully aware that the new administration may adopt a tougher stance regarding Egypt's alleged human rights violations. In July, Mr. Biden warned el-Sissi in a tweet, noting the long detention of a man arrested merely for holding a protest sign, that there would be, \"no more blank checks for Trump's \"favorite dictator.\"\" Mohamed Amashah is finally home after 486 days in Egyptian prison for holding a protest sign. Arresting, torturing, and exiling activists like Sarah Hegazy and Mohamed Soltan or threatening their families is unacceptable. No more blank checks for Trump\u2019s \"favorite dictator.\" https://t.co/RtZkbGh6ik A couple days before the U.S. elections, Egyptian authorities hastily released hundreds of prisoners that human rights organizations had classified as \"prisoners of conscience.\" Many human rights observers believe the move was made in anticipation of a possible Biden win. Saudi Arabia's King Salman and his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman were late, but eventually did congratulate Mr. Biden on his projected election win. According to Saudi Arabia's state news agency, \"King Salman praised the distinguished, historic and close relations between the two friendly countries and their people which everyone looks to strengthen and develop at all levels.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 The United Nations has called for the Crown Prince, who has fostered close ties with President Trump, to be investigated personally over the brutal murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \u00a0 During the election campaign, Mr. Biden pledged to reassess \"the relationship with the Kingdom, end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, and make sure America does not check its values at the door to sell arms or buy oil.\" Writing in the Al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper, veteran Saudi columnist Abdulrahman Al-Rashed called Biden \"an expert in international affairs.\" Al-Rashed added, however, that Mr. Biden \"needs the cooperation of the important regional powers in the world, and the role of Saudi Arabia is extremely important in consolidating stability in the region, and its role is important in the Islamic space.\"",

            "article_content": "Florida-based union members who lost their jobs during the coronavirus pandemic are making their final push to get out the vote for Joe Biden days before the election.\u00a0 They're targeting infrequent voters \u2014 who in some cases haven't cast a vote since 2008 \u2014 and hoping that sharing their personal stories will help get more of them to the polls. With over 7.8 million votes already cast\u00a0in Florida, where polls show Biden and President Trump are\u00a0virtually tied, hospitality and fast-food workers are trying to have one more conversation with some of the 6.6 million Floridians who are registered but haven't voted yet.\u00a0 High numbers of voters who did not cast a ballot in the last election are turning out in battleground states this year. In Florida, 25.8% of Democrats who have voted early in Florida so far did not vote in 2016, according to the Democratic elections data firm TargetSmart. Among Republicans, 21.8% of the total who've voted so far did not not in 2016. Most of the members of UNITE HERE, a union representing 34,000 hospitality workers in Florida, were laid off at the start of the pandemic. Seven months later many still haven't returned to their jobs, says Wendi Walsh, the union's state political director. She said UNITE HERE scrambled to get its members access to unemployment benefits and then ultimately hired some who were willing to share their stories with voters as canvassers. They are \"incredibly focused on how they've been treated over these last several months, both by Governor DeSantis and by Donald Trump,\" said Walsh.\u00a0 Florida Republicans in the state shut down their in-person voter mobilization efforts during the pandemic, but not for as long as Democratic groups did. Walsh said in June, UNITE HERE took an \"educated risk\" and restarted its in-person get-out-the-vote efforts. It consulted health professionals, hired hundreds of laid-off members, and a couple dozen began door-knocking again. The group has helped fill the in-person voter engagement gap left by Democratic organizers who were still holding mainly virtual events due to COVID-19. \u00a0 \"As much as we were having some success on the phones...you really can't replace looking someone in the eye and talking to them about their vote,\" said Walsh. \u00a0 In September, Biden made his first in-person visit to Florida as the Democratic nominee after the coronavirus forced him to cancel a trip in March. He was here again Thursday, during the last full week of the campaign. By the time Biden landed here in mid-September, Mr. Trump had already been to Florida \u2014 now his official residence \u2014 at least 10 times since the year began.\u00a0 More than 300 UNITE HERE members are working as full-time canvassers \u2014 making $684 per week \u2014 and 500 volunteers are calling voters and sending texts. Since they returned to the field three months ago, none have tested positive for the coronavirus.\u00a0 CBS News joined UNITE HERE members during a socially-distanced canvass in Central Florida. Lizbeth Concepcion, 33, is a housekeeper at Disney and a Hurricane Maria refugee. Like other Puerto Rican voters in Florida who are working to defeat President Trump, Concepcion said some of his past comments and actions towards the island will be top of mind as she votes. Concepcion is a paid canvasser who said she's also knocking doors in part because of the discrimination she's felt as a member of the LGBTQ community and because of the racism she's experienced.\u00a0 \"I feel like I'm doing something big for this society, and I enjoy it a lot,\" said Concepcion.\u00a0 \"When I knock at the door, I tell them about my story,\" said Francesca Clerizier, a 51-year-old mother of six who'd lost her job at Disney before joining UNITE HERE as a canvasser. \"I tell them please go out to vote. If you don't want to go to vote, vote for me, because I need it for my kids. I need it for my life.\" Concepcion and Clerizier have helped UNITE HERE members connect with more than 100,000 Biden supporters viewed as \"low propensity\" \u2014 those who are less likely to vote and haven't participated in recent presidential elections. These voters receive multiple phone calls and face-to-face visits from the union, Walsh said, to keep pushing them to vote. So far, her team has made 5.3 million phone calls and has knocked on nearly 350,000 doors.\u00a0 Other groups like the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) are also hitting the pavement again. In January, it launched a $150 million program \u2014 the largest in its history \u2014 to reach infrequent voters in Black, LatinX, and Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. \u00a0 Alphonso Mayfield, 42, an executive committee member for Florida for All, a group of progressive partner organizations, said SEIU has knocked on 519,000 doors since September.\u00a0 CBS News joined SEIU on a humid Saturday afternoon in downtown Orlando, where an organizer gathered members for canvassing. Using her iPad, she pulled up a list of addresses of voters in the area. Ten minutes later, the group approached a yard adorned with a Biden-Harris sign and a \"Yes on #2\" sign. The person on their list had in fact moved, but the middle-aged woman who answered the door said her family had already voted for Biden, eliciting a chorus of cheers from the SEIU members. \u00a0 After about 30 minutes, the group came across a registered voter who hadn't cast his ballot yet.\u00a0 \"We're trying to get people to go out and vote for the minimum wage to be $15,\" said Jamelia Fairley, a fast-food employee who was canvassing. \"You'll vote yes on Amendment two?\" she asked the voter. He said he would, and the SEIU group behind her cheered again. Most of the neighborhood encounters were friendly, and they came across no undecided voters. At one home, a resident shooed the canvassers away from a neighbor's yard, accusing them of soliciting, but this didn't faze them. \"The Joe Biden-Harris policy is better suited for the working class. He's talking about raising the minimum wage,\" said Joseph Gourgue Sr., a 61-year-old wheelchair attendant at the airport who makes $9 an hour.\u00a0 Fairley, 25, is a leader in the Fight for 15 campaign, an effort to increase the minimum wage in Florida to $15 an hour. She brought her young daughter with her as she knocked on doors to promote the pay hike.\u00a0 \"It's hard living off of $10 an hour because I still can barely afford rent and food on the table,\" said Fairley. She added, \"We're trying to make a change and the only way we can make a change is if we go out and vote.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Texas has seen one of the highest upticks in newly registered voters in the nation, with over 3 million people who registered after the 2016 election.\u00a0 That means about 1 in every 5 voters in Texas in 2020 were not registered in 2016 and Democrats are betting the surge could help flip Texas this year.\u00a0 As of Monday, Texas' secretary of state lists more than 16.9 million registered voters in its database, a state record and a net gain of 1.8 million since 2016. President Trump won the state by 807,179 votes in 2016. Democratic Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke lost his statewide race by 214,921 votes. While registration gains ebbed in March and April, at the beginning of the pandemic, more than 585,000 new voters have registered since September 1.\u00a0 The Census Bureau says Texas' population has grown by 3.85 million since 2010, 2 million of whom are Hispanic. Early voting in Texas kicks off Tuesday. More than 1.8 million Texans voted early in the March primaries, about 45% of the total turnout. Including mail votes, over half of Texans voted early or by mail during the primary. \u00a0 Texans aren't required to designate a party when they register, but Democratic operatives anticipate at least 60% of these new voters are Democrats because so many of them are young and from communities of color.\u00a0 \"We think that population skews heavily Democrat,\" said Luke Warford, the Texas Democrats' voter expansion director. \"And what that means is that's going to translate to a lot of Democratic victories up and down the ballot in November.\" In the state's 10 most-populated counties, the epicenters for these population hikes and shifting demographics, there have been more than 402,000 newly registered voters since January.\u00a0 The state hasn't elected a Democrat for president since 1976, but has tight polling margins consistent with other key battleground states. The latest CBS News Battleground Tracker has President Trump tied with Vice President Joe Biden, 49% to 49%, but still leaning Republican because of its electoral history. The poll also shows that at least six out of 10 Hispanic support Biden, which is consistent with historic trends. About one-third of the Hispanic vote has gone to Republicans in the past decade.\u00a0 A poll from the University of Texas/Texas Tribune released last week showed Mr. Trump leading Biden by a larger margin, 50% to 45%.\u00a0 Since September 2019, the Texas Republican party says it has been able to register at least 160,000 likely Republican voters who have moved into the state, and they're \"confident\" their outreach efforts will keep Texas Republican.\u00a0 \"These blue-state refugees simply need to be educated on the policy failures of their old homes. They don't want to see Texas become like the San Francisco or Manhattan they fled,\" said Texas GOP communications director Luke Twombly.\u00a0 In June 2019, GOP super PAC Engage Texas started to ramp up Republican registrations. But by May, the group shuttered, citing the coronavirus as a reason.\u00a0 Biden's campaign is making a big play for the Lone Star State. It has spent over $8 million on ads, according to Kantar/CMAG data. Mr. Trump's campaign is spending about $6.8 million on Texas air time. The Democratic nominee has mostly stuck to virtual events to rally supporters, relying mostly on Texas-based surrogates. But on Tuesday, Jill Biden will be visiting Houston, Dallas and El Paso to mark the start of early voting. Joe Biden last visited the Lone Star State in early March, ahead of Super Tuesday. The Trump campaign has been campaigning in person in Texas and surrogates have traveled to the state. Mr. Trump visited Texas multiple times this summer for White House official events and fundraisers, and Vice President Pence went to Dallas in June.\u00a0 The other races on the ballot have dwarfed the presidential contest in spending. More than $30 million has been spent on the state's Senate race between incumbent John Cornyn and MJ Hegar, according to Kantar/CMAG data. Around $16.7 million has been spent overall in the presidential campaign.\u00a0 About $51 million has been collectively raised by candidates in the 10 battleground House races, the latest FEC reports note. In the races for the eight GOP-held or open seats the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is targeting, three Democrats are out raising their GOP opponents.\u00a0 Democrats are also betting that the registration upticks are more than enough to overcome close losses during Beto O'Rourke's 2018 Senate race. Congressman Dan Crenshaw kept Texas' 2nd Congressional district Republican and won by 19,196 votes in 2018. O'Rourke saw a tighter margin, losing by a slim 3,099 votes in this district. One of his former advisers, Sima Ladjevardian, is running as a Democratic nominee against Crenshaw. Crenshaw, a former Navy Seal, is popular in the state and an effective fundraiser, raking in $9.26 million this cycle for his re-election. But on paper, the Houston-area district has seen the changing and diversifying demographics that Democrats are optimistic about. The 2nd District is entirely based in Harris County, which has seen an uptick of at least 60,000 registered voters since 2018.\u00a0 \"The dynamics of Harris County have completely changed,\" Ladjevardian said. \"It's been years of tireless organizing \u2014 that is something that had been taking place in Beto's race. But since 2018, I think everyone is understanding everything is on the line this time.\" Multiple organizations, from O'Rourke's 'Powered by People' PAC to Voto Latino, have focused on voter registration efforts. Voto Latino announced Monday that it has registered 257,294 Texans for the 2020 election cycle.\u00a0 Michael Adams, political science department chair at Texas Southern University, said Democrats have been winning the voter registration battle because of the enthusiasm generated by the House and Senate races on the ballot. Democrats flipped 12 state House seats in 2018, and are nine away from flipping the chamber altogether ahead of 2021 redistricting.\u00a0 \"I don't think it will be a whole lot about who's at the top of the ticket. I don't see a lot of enthusiasm, to be honest with you, when it comes to Biden....I think the local ground game here is because of that interest and the excitement and anticipation in [the other] races,\" Adams said. \"They're going to be pivotal.\" In July, Governor Greg Abbott authorized an extra six days of early in-person voting in Texas because of the COVID-19 pandemic, after rejecting calls to expand access to mail-in voting. Republicans tried to sue to block the extended period, but last week the Texas Supreme Court left the extended time frame in place. There are ongoing legal battles over Abbott's recent order limiting mail-in ballot drop-off sites to one per county. On Friday, a federal judge blocked his order, but the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals put the order back into effect the next day, meaning the limit is still in place.

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden and his team have been extremely cautious about his contact with foreign governments since the election, continuing the careful approach his campaign took.\u00a0 Because the Trump State Department has refused to facilitate official contact with the president-elect's team, foreign governments wishing to place congratulatory calls to Mr. Biden have been reaching out directly to adviser Antony Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state, and his team to arrange the phone conversations. The calls are taking place over unsecured telephone lines and without the usual assistance of an official translator or the State Department operations center. Blinken, who sometimes remains on the line, according to a person familiar with the calls, is widely considered to be a front runner for the position of either secretary of state or national security adviser.\u00a0 The requests to offer Mr. Biden a congratulatory call frequently come from ambassadors to the U.S. and are scheduled by a former deputy assistant secretary of state, Amanda Sloat. For some countries the requests are coming from official offices like the United Kingdom's 10 Downing Street, a person familiar with the calls told CBS News. \u00a0 Other requests from smaller nations and less-connected embassies sometimes require multiple emails before they reach a recipient on the transition team who can make the connection to Mr. Biden, this person added. \u00a0 Three diplomatic sources have told CBS News that while the Biden team is allowing those congratulatory calls to take place, substance is kept to a minimal level. Any other contact between incoming administration advisers and the foreign governments is being heavily restricted. That means that even allies that the U.S. is treaty-bound to protect are being kept at an arm's length.\u00a0 \"The president-elect firmly believes in the principle that there must be only one president at a time guiding our country's foreign policy and national security,\" a transition official told CBS News.\u00a0 President Trump has previously accused Democrats of violating the rarely-enforced Logan Act, which bars unauthorized private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments. For instance, he has accused former Secretary of State John Kerry of having \"many meetings and many phone calls with Iran in violation of the Logan Act.\" Kerry has defended the conversations he's had Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif during the Trump administration by saying that it's common for secretaries of state to continue to meet with foreign counterparts after their tenure has ended. \u00a0 This cautiousness in Mr. Biden's calls contrasts with Mr. Trump's transition process. \u00a0 The Biden team is mindful of what happened at the tail end of the Obama administration in December 2016, when the Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, asked Trump son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner and incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn to lobby foreign governments on Israel's behalf and in contravention of the Obama administration's foreign policy. Flynn tried and failed to get Russia to delay a vote at the United Nations that was perceived to be damaging to Israel. Flynn and Kushner unsuccessfully lobbied other governments on the issue, too.\u00a0 A number of foreign governments who would normally have reached out by now to arrange a congratulatory call have also chosen to keep their distance this time until inauguration or until Mr. Trump concedes.\u00a0 In his first four days as president-elect, Mr. Biden has spoken with nine foreign leaders, according to readouts of the calls. \u00a0 The president-elect's latest call came from Pope Francis on Thursday before Mr. Biden, who will be the second-ever Catholic president, traveled to his Delaware beach house. The readout of the call said Biden spoke with His Holiness about \"caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities.\" \u00a0 Before he was elected, Mr. Biden previewed his approach to global issues. \"Folks, American foreign policy, I think has to be purposeful and inspiring \u2014based on clear goals, driven by sound strategies \u2014 not by Twitter tantrum,\" he said in Iowa. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "When President-elect Joe Biden assumes office in January, he will become only the second Catholic president in U.S. history, following John F. Kennedy. On Saturday, after Mr. Biden was projected\u00a0winner of the presidential race, Catholics around the world reacted to the historic moment.\u00a0 During his victory speech Saturday night, Mr. Biden referenced his faith when he quoted the hymn \"On Eagles' Wings,\" which he said meant a lot to his family, particularly his late son, Beau, who died of cancer in 2015. \"It captures the faith that sustains me and which I believe sustains America,\" Biden said, before reciting some of the lyrics. James J. Martin SJ, an American Jesuit priest who serves as a consultant to the Vatican's communications secretary, tweeted about the significance.\u00a0 \"The surprise 'On Eagles' Wings' reference by @JoeBiden, which made my phone buzz like crazy, made me realize: this means four years of not only a Catholic president, but an injection of #Catholic culture into our national conversation in a way probably not seen since JFK,\" Martin wrote. The surprise \"On Eagles' Wings\" reference by @JoeBiden, which made my phone buzz like crazy, made me realize: this means four years of not only a Catholic president, but an injection of #Catholic culture into our national conversation in a way probably not seen since JFK. pic.twitter.com/PkE9PnEMP1 Martin also shared a screenshot showing \"On Eagles' Wings\" was trending on Twitter in the U.S. On Thursday, the Biden-Harris transition team announced the president-elected had spoken with Pope Francis. Biden \"thanked His Holiness for extending blessings and congratulations and noted his appreciation for His Holiness' leadership in promoting peace, reconciliation, and the common bonds of humanity around the world,\" a statement from the transition team reads.\u00a0 Biden also expressed to the pope his \"desire to work together on the basis of a shared belief in the dignity and equality of all humankind on issues such as caring for the marginalized and the poor, addressing the crisis of climate change, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities.\" Sr. Simone Campbell, an American Roman Catholic Religious Sister, lawyer and activist, also tweeted about Biden. \"Congratulations to my friend, and our President-elect, Joseph R. Biden!\" she wrote. \"I look forward to working with you and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to create a more perfect union.\" \"Glad that our nation has picked @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris to lead us into a new chapter,\" Campbell's tweet continued. Archbishop Jos\u00e9 H. Gomez, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops also issued a statement\u00a0on the election. \"I believe that at this moment in American history, Catholics have a special duty to be peacemakers, to promote fraternity and mutual trust, and to pray for a renewed spirit of true patriotism in our country,\" Gomez said in the statement.\u00a0 \"Democracy requires that all of us conduct ourselves as people of virtue and self-discipline. It requires that we respect the free expression of opinions and that we treat one another with charity and civility, even as we might disagree deeply in our debates on matters of law and public policy,\" he continued.\u00a0 \"As we do this, we recognize that Joseph R. Biden, Jr., has received enough votes to be elected the 46th President of the United States. We congratulate Mr. Biden and acknowledge that he joins the late President John F. Kennedy as the second United States president to profess the Catholic faith. We also congratulate Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California, who becomes the first woman ever elected as vice president.\" On Election Day, Mr. Biden, a devout Catholic, started out by attending Mass and visiting the graves of his son, Beau, and his first wife Neilia and infant daughter Naomi, who were both killed in a car crash in 1972. On Sunday, Mr. Biden did the same, attending Mass with his daughter Ashley and grandson Hunter at St. Joseph on the Brandywine Catholic Church in Wilmington, Delaware, and then visiting his family members' graves.\u00a0 Mr. Biden's Catholic faith caused few ripples on the campaign trail, in stark contrast to the attention that surrounded John F. Kennedy's religion when he ran for president in 1960. At the time, many Protestants were suspicious about whether Kennedy might place loyalty to the Vatican over U.S. interests, and he gave a widely reported speech reassuring Americans, \"I believe in a president whose religious views are his own private affair, neither imposed by him upon the nation, or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.\" The Pew Research Center notes that while Catholicism \"has long been the nation's largest religious denomination,\" only two other Catholics \u2014 Democrats Al Smith in 1928 and John Kerry in 2004 \u2014 have ever been major party presidential nominees. Mr. Biden's running mate, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris considers herself a Baptist but also grew up with exposure to her mother's Hindu traditions, and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is Jewish.\u00a0 \"From all of these traditions and teachings, I've learned that faith is not only something we express in church and prayerful reflection, but also in the way we live our lives, do our work and pursue our respective callings,\" Harris said in an interview with the\u00a0Religion News Service. When Harris assumes office, she will make history as the first woman, Black and Asian American vice president, and Emhoff will be the first\u00a0\"second gentleman,\" the unofficial title for spouse to the vice president.

Representatives Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley joined forces during their first two years in Congress and became prominent targets of President Trump. All four ran for reelection this year \u2014 and all four have won. CBS News has projected that Omar defeated Lacy Johnson in Minnesota, Ocasio-Cortez defeated John Cummings in New York, Tlaib defeated David Dudenhoefer in Michigan, and Ayana Pressley defeated Roy Owens in Massachusetts. To mark the group's success,\u00a0Omar tweeted\u00a0a simple message: \"Our sisterhood is resilient.\"\u00a0 Our sisterhood is resilient. pic.twitter.com/IfLtsvLEdx The four freshmen congresswomen have supported ambitious progressive proposals like the Green New Deal, a higher minimum wage, and calls to impeach President Trump.\u00a0 Shortly after being sworn in, they dubbed themselves \"The Squad\" and found themselves in a battle with\u00a0Mr. Trump, who took aim\u00a0at them in a series of tweets in 2019. In one tweet, he falsely asserted that they \"originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe,\" and said they should \"go back\" to them. All four congresswomen, of course, are U.S. citizens and three were born here; Omar, a Somalian refugee, has been a citizen for two decades.\u00a0 While the president didn't name the women in his tweets, he made clear in later statements he was referring to The Squad members. The women later held\u00a0a press conference\u00a0together to push back against the president's remarks. The\u00a0House also voted to condemn\u00a0Mr. Trump's \"racist comments,\" saying they \"legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\"\u00a0 The Squad later sat down for an interview with \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King in which Pressley and Tlaib said Mr. Trump's attack was a \"a distraction.\" Omar said, \"You should be asking, why is it that we are being criticized? What is it that we bring to this body?\" \"I'll tell you what we bring,\" Tlaib said.\u00a0\"We're an extension of a movement in our country that wants Medicare for all, that wants us to end mass incarceration,\" the Michigan congresswoman asserted. \"That wants us to push back against the attacks on communities of color. I mean, I think all of us have incredibly strong residents in our district that have spoke volumes in electing people like us.\" Caitlin O'Kane is a digital content producer covering trending stories for CBS News and its good news brand, The Uplift.",

            "article_content": "Congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota on Tuesday overcame a primary challenge from a well-funded opponent who tried to make an issue of her national celebrity. Omar, seeking her second term in November, defeated Antone Melton-Meaux, an attorney and mediator who raised millions in anti-Omar money.  Melton-Meaux used the cash to paper the district and flood airwaves with his \"Focused on the Fifth\" message that portrayed Omar, a member of \"The Squad\" of four progressive female members of Congress, as out of touch with the Minneapolis-area 5th District.  Omar in 2018 became one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, building on a national profile that started when the onetime refugee from Somalia was elected to the Minnesota Legislature just two years earlier. Her aggressive advocacy on liberal issues, and her eagerness to take on President Trump, made her even more prominent.  Omar rejected Melton-Meaux's attacks, saying they were funded by interests who wanted to get her out of Congress because she's effective. She also downplayed Melton-Meaux's prodigious fundraising before the vote, saying, \"Organized people will always beat organized money.\"  Democratic U.S. Senator Tina Smith and Republican challenger Jason Lewis easily won their primaries in the only statewide races on the ballot. Elsewhere, in western Minnesota's conservative 7th District, former state Senator Michelle Fischbach was the endorsed Republican in a three-way race for the right to challenge Democratic Representative Collin Peterson. Peterson, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, is one of the GOP's top targets to flip a House seat in November.  After entering Congress with fanfare, Omar hurt herself early with comments about Israel and money that even some fellow Democrats called anti-Semitic, and found herself apologizing. She also came under scrutiny when her marriage fell apart and she married her political consultant  months after denying they were having an affair.  Republicans also raised questions about continuing payments to her new husband's firm, though experts said they aren't necessarily improper.  In the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis, police reform also emerged as an issue. Omar supported a push by a majority of the Minneapolis City Council to replace the city's police department with something new. Melton-Meaux did not support that, but did support shifting some funding away from police to more social service-oriented programs. Both touched on the issue in personal ways, with Omar saying she wanted her son to grow up safely. Melton-Meaux, who is also Black, told a personal story of being detained while at the University of Virginia by police seeking an assault suspect reported to have run into his apartment building.  Progressive Democrats gained confidence in Omar's reelection chances after primary victories last week  by fellow \"Squad\" member Rashida Tlaib in Michigan and by Cori Bush, a Black Lives Matter activist, in a St. Louis-area congressional primary.\u00a0 Progressives also claimed momentum from the renewed focus on racial and economic justice after Floyd's death.

            "article_content": "What is going on at my hometown Walmart? On Saturday, the first day of Minnesota's mandatory mask mandate, a man and a woman went shopping at the Walmart in Marshall \u2014 population 15,000 \u2014 wearing masks with swastikas.\u00a0 In a video posted to Facebook, the man calmly pays for items \u2014 including toilet paper and a tub of cheese balls \u2014 while the woman responds to shoppers challenging her: \"If you vote for Biden you're gonna be living in Nazi Germany, that's what it's going to be like. Socialism is gonna happen here in America!\" She gestured with both middle fingers and later blew an air kiss from behind her mask. The video was posted by Raphaela Mueller, a 24-year-old local Lutheran vicar. \"I audibly gasped,\" Mueller said in a phone interview with CBS News, explaining she first saw the pair with the swastika masks in the kitchen section. She proceeded to the customer service desk to inform management and by then, the couple was nearby checking out. Mueller's partner, Benjamin Ruesch, yelled at the pair. \"You're sick! Yeah, you're sick. You can't be American and wear that mask ... we literally had a war about this.\" The woman said, \"You're not getting it, I'm not a Nazi.\" \"Then why are you wearing the f**king mask?\" Mueller asked.\u00a0 \"Because I'm trying to tell you if you vote for Biden this is what you are going to have, socialism!\"  The local police were called and a police department official told CBS News the 59-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were issued \"trespass notices,\" which Walmart confirmed means they are not allowed in any Walmart facility for at least one year. But before the pair left the store, the man wearing the swastika mask was punched in the face by a fellow shopper, Marshall Police Chief Jim Marshall confirmed to CBS News on Monday. The man who punched the masked shopper fled before police arrived, Marshall said, and added the swastika-masked man did not want to \"pursue any criminal charges\" for the face punching. CBS News has not been able to identify the pair and their names were not shared by the police department. Walmart said in a statement provided to CBS News, \"What happened today at our store in Marshall, MN is unacceptable. We strive to provide a safe and comfortable shopping environment for all our customers and will not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment in any aspect of our business. We are asking everyone to wear face coverings when they enter our stores for their safety and the safety of others and it's unfortunate that some individuals have taken this pandemic as an opportunity to create a distressing situation for customers and associates in our store.\" Walmart told CBS News a local manager tried to offer the couple disposable face masks but they declined. Mueller said the history of the swastika and Nazi Germany is personal to her. She said she is a German citizen currently on visa to study seminary in the United States, and that she grew up hearing stories about her great-grandmother, Magdalena, a member of an underground Nazi-resistance organization called \"The Red Chapel.\" In an American Walmart 75 years after the end of World War II, Mueller said she \"was not prepared for seeing something like this with my own eyes\" and said she only watched her recording once as it was too painful. Marshall, a predominantly White town, has diversified in the past 40 years as home to growing Latino, east African, and Asian immigrants, but the Jewish community is very small. Nonna Gutman, my high school math teacher who immigrated to America in 1991 with her family from the Soviet Union as a Jewish refugee, said her family accounts for \"half of the Jewish population\" in town. Gutman said her first reaction to the video was \"shock\" but stated she thought the two were trying to drum up attention by incorrectly using the swastika to represent socialism, which Gutman argued must also be condemned. \"They used the Nazi swastika to bring attention to what they believe is bad. Do I approve swastika use for any reason? Absolutely not,\" Gutman added. \"It was somewhat comforting to me to see people objecting.\" The woman in the store said they are not Nazis, but the brazenness of the symbol's public display comes at a time when anti-Semitic incidents of assault, vandalism and harassment are at the highest rate in the U.S. since 1979, the Anti-Defamation League noted in May. There were more than 2,000 such incidents in 2019, the ADL said.\u00a0 Joe Biden says \u00a0he decided to run for president after the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where neo-Nazi and white supremacists killed one woman and injured dozens others after driving into the crowd of counter-protesters I had been following.\u00a0 With 100 days to go until the presidential election, the country is debating proper pandemic policies and how to move forward. In the meantime, the message from local officials in Marshall is clear: Requiring that you wear a mask is not Nazism. \"This is a health issue, not a political issue,\" said Bob Byrnes, the mayor of Marshall, Minnesota. \"I think the vast majority of the people recognize that wearing a mask is the best way of controlling the spread of the virus.\" The display of racism will also continue to be investigated, the mayor said.\u00a0 Bo Erickson is a reporter covering the White House for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump's defense for admittedly downplaying the risks of the coronavirus is \"disingenuous,\" former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson told CBSN in an interview Monday. Mr. Trump told journalist Bob Woodward in taped interviews that he did not want to panic the public by leveling with them about the virus in the early months of the pandemic.\u00a0 In early February, Mr. Trump told Woodward that the virus was \"more deadly\" than \"even your strenuous flus\" and that it's difficult to stop because \"it goes through air.\" But publicly, he often said the virus would \"go away\" and on March 19, he told Woodward, \"I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down because I don't want to create a panic.\"\u00a0 But Johnson said Mr. Trump's \"entire campaign strategy\" for reelection this year \"is to create panic and instill fear in the American people.\" \"When he talks about how election night is going to be a disaster, how if Joe Biden is elected, he's going to bring in Cory Booker to\u00a0destroy the suburbs\u00a0\u2014 you'll recall, two years ago, during the midterms, he talked about caravans marching toward the southern border from Central America,\" Johnson said. \"To say now that the reason he didn't want to be honest with the American people about the dangers of this virus is because he didn't want to create panic is frankly disingenuous.\" Johnson called the United States' response to the pandemic \"tragically disappointing.\" \"The nation with the most powerful public health care apparatus has had the poorest public health care response, and that is due largely to a failure of national leadership from the beginning to tell the American people the truth about the dangers that we face,\" he said.\u00a0 Since the pandemic began, more than 194,000 Americans have died. Johnson said that by mid April, the country knew how to combat the virus through social distancing, wearing masks, practicing in good hygiene and staying at home. \"But, tragically, we've continued to see surges across the country because our national leadership has not been truthful with us about the things we need to do, and has encouraged the American people to let their guard down, get sloppy, go to mass gatherings and the like. And so we are now, as I speak, approaching 200,000 dead here in this country as a result,\" he said.\u00a0 Johnson also commented on the Trump administration's policy of turning away asylum-seekers at the border during the pandemic. Under the emergency policy, which the Trump administration says is designed to prevent coronavirus outbreaks, more than 159,000 people, including\u00a0nearly 9,000 unaccompanied children, have been expelled. Calling the policy \"aggressive,\" Johnson warned that it simply encourages people to find another way to cross the border. \"Up until this year, what migrants would do is they cross the border, and they would assume that they would be apprehended by our Border Patrol, and then they'd make a case for asylum,\" Johnson said. \"Now, with the implication of this law, we're probably simply just encouraging migrants to avoid capture and get into our country undetected.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump appeared at the White House Rose Garden for a last-minute address to the nation in the wake of demonstrations, Monday evening, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"We will end it now,\" Mr. Trump said, calling himself, \"your president of law and order.\"\u00a0 Exactly one week after Minnesotan George Floyd's death in police custody, the president said he has recommended every state executive deploy its National Guard: \"We will dominate the streets.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump added that if states or cities refuse to act in response to protests, \"then I will deploy the U.S. military and quickly solve the problem for them.\" He also announced the federal government will dispatch \"thousands and thousands\" of \"heavily armed soldiers\" and police to enforce the 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, D.C., tonight, adding that violators would be detained and prosecuted.\u00a0 Loud explosions echoed through the Rose Garden as police deployed tear gas canisters and flash bangs on peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park to clear the way for the president. Flanked by members of his cabinet and staff, Mr. Trump departed White House grounds for a visit to historic St. John's Church, a sanctuary where presidents past have long worshipped. Boarded up following last night's demonstrations that briefly set the church's basement ablaze, the president did not enter to pray, but vowed to keep the country \"nice and safe\" while wielding a Bible. Only hours earlier, President Trump unloaded on the nation's governors Monday morning, calling them \"weak\" for failing to more aggressively enforce law and order over the weekend, as some of the nation's biggest cities\u00a0burned in the wake of the death of George Floyd,\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe.\u00a0 On a video teleconference, the president warned that the law enforcement presence across Washington would be set to intensify later Monday. He said the protests are ruining the nation's standing on the world stage. And he called on governors to pass new bans on flag burning, a constitutionally protected expression of free speech. \"Washington was under very good control, but we're going to have it under much more control,\" Mr. Trump said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CBS News. \"We're going to pull in thousands of people.\" He added later, \"We're going to clamp down very, very strong.\"\u00a0 The president's comments came as Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that the nation's capital would be under a 7 p.m. ET curfew for the next two nights. And the president spoke as his presumed Democratic Party rival,\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden, was praying and meeting with religious and community leaders in his\u00a0hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, about the violence roiling the country. During the call, the president repeatedly called into question the leadership and decisions made over the weekend by governors and big-city mayors, pressuring them to make broader use of the National Guard and other military capabilities.\u00a0 \"You're making a mistake because you're making yourselves look like fools,\" he told the governors at one point. \"And some have done a great job. But a lot of you, it's not \u2013 it's not a great day for our country.\" One participant on the call described the president's words and tone as \"unhinged.\" \u00a0\"You have to dominate, if you don't dominate you're wasting your time. They're going to run over you. You're going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate,\" the president told governors. The president said that the violence \"is coming from the radical left \u2014 you know, it everybody knows it \u2014 but it's also looters, and it's people that figure they can get free stuff by running into stores and running out with television sets. I saw it \u2014 a kid has a lot of stuff, he puts it in the back of a brand new car and drives off. You have every one of these guys on tape. Why aren't you prosecuting them? Now, the harder you are, the tougher you are, the less likely you're going to be hit.\" This kind of violence has happened before, Mr. Trump said. \"It's happened numerous times. And the only time it's successful is when you're weak. And most of you are weak. I will say this, what's going on in Los Angeles \u2014 I have a friend lives in Los Angeles \u2014 they say all the storefronts are gone,\" the president continued. \"They're all broken and gone. The merchandise is gone. It's a shame. It didn't look as bad to me \u2014 maybe it was the sunshine, I don't know. But in Los Angeles, the storefronts are gone. Philadelphia's a mess. What happened there is horrible.\" Prior to his press conference this evening, the president himself\u00a0hadn't been seen\u00a0publicly since Saturday, when he attended a space shuttle launch and addressed the death of George Floyd in Florida. Mr. Trump was briefly moved to the\u00a0White House bunker\u00a0on Friday evening as protests were being held near the White House. Mr. Trump was joined on the call by Attorney General William Barr \u2014 who he said he plans to \"activate very strongly\" \u2014 General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper. \"We can't play whack-a-mole,\" Barr told the governors \u2014 before the president interjected. \"If you're weak and don't dominate your streets, they're going to stay with you until you finally do it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And you don't want it. Philadelphia, you'd better toughen up. Because what's going on in Philadelphia, like New York, is terrible. It's terrible. You'd better toughen \u2014 they'll never leave. I know you want to say, 'Oh, let's not call up the Guard, let's call up 200 people.' You've got a big National Guard out there that's ready to come in and fight like hell. I tell ya, the best, what they did in Minneapolis was incredible.\"\u00a0 \"We're shocked that you're not using the greatest resource,\" the president added \u2014 urging governors to call up the National Guard.\u00a0 Esper told the governors that so far just two states had called up more than 1,000 Guard troops. \"You've got to arrest these people. You've got arrest these people \u2014 and you've got to charge them,\" the president said to the governors. \"And you can't do this deal where they get one week in jail. These are terrorists, these are terrorists, they're looking to do bad things to our country. They're Antifa and they're radical left.\"\u00a0 Amid talk of more aggressive police tactics, the president made specific suggestions on how law enforcement should engage aggressive protesters: \"When they have bricks \u2014 you know they come armed with bricks. And they have bricks and rocks, big rocks, and they have other big things, and they throw them. You know, you're allowed to fight back, folks. You don't have to have a brick hit you in the face, and you don't do anything about it. You are allowed to fight back,\" the president said. Mentioning Barr, the president said, \"Bill \u2014... if a brick is thrown at somebody, and it hits them, or maybe if it doesn't hit them, your very tough, strong, powerful people are allowed to fight back against that guy. And very strongly and powerfully.\" FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN At Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday, Joe Biden sat in front of the altar area with a notepad in his hands and a mask on his face to listen to the ideas of local political and religious leaders on how to engage communities after the death of George Floyd,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports.\u00a0 For his part, Biden said he would recommend a \"police oversight board\" within the first 100 days of his administration. In the next few weeks, Biden said he would make several national addresses about how the country should proceed. For these addresses, he was taking suggestions from the community members as they socially-distant gathered in the church pews.\u00a0 Reverends and bishops spoke about engaging youth leaders and not hearing their ideas filtered through a \"youth minister.\" Some of the political and business leaders said that economic help, including addressing poverty, was vital, too. One of the most emotional moments was when Delaware Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, an ally of Biden's, displayed her bracelet dedicated to Floyd's words during the arrest: \"I can't breathe.\"\u00a0 Blunt Rochester said Floyd's death is an example that minorities' \"breath has been taken away, and we have to get it back.\" The congresswoman also was straightforward with Biden that the country has \"so many programs\" that have not been effective. \"We need action and we need resources,\" she told him. Others gathered, like Reverend Shanika Perry, described to Biden that it was difficult to be his \"surrogate\" with young people she knows because they have hesitations about his role with the 1994 crime bill. Perry and one other bishop added that one way Biden could positively move forward is by picking a black woman as his running mate. Later in the day, Biden virtually gathered with the mayors of major cities including Mayor Melvin Carter from St. Paul, Mayor Lori Lightfoot from Chicago, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms from Atlanta and Mayor Eric Garcetti from Los Angeles. These mayors echoed many of the sentiments of the local leaders in the morning session. Biden reiterated to the mayors he believes it is important for their citizens to \"find a balance\" between understandable protests and emotions (\"I'm angry too,\" Biden said) and the destruction that has occurred in some places.\u00a0 Carter said St. Paul residents are not willing to \"return to quiet\" but instead are adhering to an approach of \"peace but not patience.\" Lightfoot called the nationwide reaction to the alleged actions of Officer Derek Chauvin \"momentous,\" as she described it as a rallying moment for people, politicians and uniformed officers alike. All four mayors expressed their own grievances with the federal government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent protests.\u00a0 Lance Bottoms explained that the president said he would send the military to help with the protests but doesn't send a \"single dime\" into communities like hers. \"The simple answer,\" Garcetti said, was \"we need money and morals\" from the federal government. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters during today's briefing that President Trump has \"a long history of condemning white supremacy and racism.\" But the president, in fact, has a\u00a0long history of stoking racial tensions\u00a0dating back to his time as a New York City real estate mogul, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0 In 1989, the president called for the state of New York to adopt the death penalty following the conviction of the \"Central Park Five,\" five black and Latino men who as teenagers were wrongly convicted of the raping of a jogger in Manhattan. As late as 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump\u00a0falsely claimed that President Obama\u00a0was not born in the United States. The president remarked there were\u00a0\"fine people\" on \"both sides\"\u00a0of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, following a white supremacy rally in 2017.\u00a0 And last year, the president said a\u00a0group of four minority congresswomen\u00a0should \"go back\" to the countries they came from, a factually inaccurate, racial trope. The White House confirmed President Trump is scheduled to travel to Maine, Friday. Earlier today on the president's call with state leaders, Maine Governor Janet Mills expressed her concerns with Mr. Trump that his trip might \"cause security problems\" following Maine's peaceful protests.\u00a0 The president said he expects a \"tremendous crowd\" but no problems. \"I think most of them are very favorable,\" Trump said of the anticipated audience. \"They like their president.\" LIFE AFTER 2020 CORY BOOKER New Jersey Senator Cory Booker announced the framework for policing reform legislation says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. The former presidential candidate called for reforming 18 U.S.C. Section 242, a federal statute that governs police misconduct, for greater police accountability in the federal court system.\u00a0 Part of the legislation also includes the creation of a national police misconduct registry that would provide increased transparency in police misconduct data. In addition, Booker wants to improve police training by banning religious and racial profiling, funding racial bias training and \"incentivizing states to adopt policies banning the use of choke-hold and other airway restrictive holds in their use-of-force policies.\"\u00a0 In a press call, Booker said, \"Persistent and unchecked bias in policing and this deep history of a lack of accountability are wreaking havoc in African-American communities. And we are seeing the protests. Millions of people expressing outrage for change.\" ISSUES THAT MATTER PROTESTING President Trump has signaled the federal government \"will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,\" even though there is no existing legal authority for the move, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. As protests over the death of George Floyd continue for a second week, President Trump is holding left-wing extremists groups responsible for the damage and discord on the streets of America.\u00a0 This morning on a call with governors, the president said that the violence \"is coming from the radical left, you know it, everybody knows it.\" A new report from the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism says\u00a0an initial assessment of protests\u00a0revealed that \"while a number of extremists \u2013 including anti-government agitators, anarchists and a handful of white supremacists \u2013 are taking an active role, these protests should not be categorized as \"extremist\" events at this point.\" According to the ADL assessment \"a handful of white supremacists have shown up at Black Lives Matter rallies around the country,\" while other white supremacists are using violent images and videos of the protests as recruitment tools. On social media, ADL found that some white supremacists, especially those supportive of \"accelerationism\" \u2013 the view that a long-promised race-war is imminent \u2013 are celebrating the prospect of increased violence and urging others to take full advantage.\u00a0 The ADL assessment also found that right-wing anti-government extremist groups like the \"boogaloo\" movement, are also reacting to the protests. While most boogalooers are not white supremacists, the ADL says, they variously anticipate and prepare for a future civil war. \"Many boogalooers have seen the protests as an opportunity to further their anti-police crusade and make common cause with others angry at police,\" the ADL report reads.\u00a0 \"In sharp contrast to the boogalooers, members of the militia movement and allied groups have expressed very little empathy with the protesters. Their reactions have been far more hostile, in part because the militia movement views the protests as organized by the extreme left for nefarious purposes.\" While the ADL assessment provides several examples of right-wing groups showing up at protests across the country and using the moment for personal gains on social media, it only makes one reference to Antifa, simply mentioning that they have \"also shown up at protests.\"\u00a0 Asked about extremist groups showing up at protests to cause chaos, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said during a press conference Monday there will be investigations about who is causing the damage and admitted \"I got out over my skis a little bit on this and as I said, I think it was probably hard for me to fathom that this was coming internally. You cannot have a blind spot.\" Walz said in addition to the social media posts from extremist groups, the data set \"has to be much broader\" in order to provide a better understanding of the issue. John Harrington, commissioner of Minnesota Department of Public Safety, also said there is a need for more data outside of social media to understand and prove the involvement of extremist groups at protests. Harrington said he heard \"crazy stuff\" about the \"Klan marching down the street and we've got traffic cams, we've got \u2013 none of that happened.\" He added that \"some of it looks like it is deliberately being planned as misinformation.\" STATE-BY-STATE CALIFORNIA California Governor Gavin Newsom said he cares more about unity \"than some of the noise\" he heard on a phone call with President Trump this morning. Newsom said his reaction to Monday morning's call where the president called governors \"weak\" is \"to focus on the things that unite us not what divides us.\"\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says Newsom added that California will provide resources needed to local officials and community leaders to address the rise in violence \"but we must resolve to provide those resources to address the systematic problems.\"\u00a0 Reacting to the calls for justice that have led to nationwide protests, Newsom said \"the black community is not responsible for what is happening in this country right now. We are. We are. Our institutions are responsible. We have a unique responsibility to the black community in this country and we've been paying lip service about that for generations.\"\u00a0 The California governor said people have lost patience \"because they haven't seen progress.\" In order to meet the moment, Newsom said leaders need to listen, adding \"society becomes how we behave, we are our behaviors. Each and every one of us has an obligation to do better.\"\u00a0 Since the coronavirus outbreak, Newsom has been hesitant about directly criticizing President Trump, but he's often said the country lacks leadership. During Monday afternoon's press conference Newsom said leaders can be found everywhere. \u00a0 \"Leadership is not just some fancy title,\" Newsom said. \"We are desperate for leadership in this country,\" he added. President Trump has recently blamed ANTIFA, left-wing anti-fascist extremists, for inciting the violence at protests. Mr. Trump also tweeted Monday afternoon a video with the caption \"Anarchists, we see you!\" But Newsom refused to name any specific groups on Monday. \"You have groups that are hell-bent on creating problems and anarchists groups. You've got folks that are well defined that have been highlighted by the president and others,\" Newsom said. \u00a0 He added that he's not suggesting the names of the groups should be hidden, \"but I also see every time elected official like me mentions them, they start to be spread between their supporters, and with all due respect of some of these groups, I'm not going to give you that privilege right now.\" FLORIDA Amid ongoing protests that took place over the weekend in response to the killing of George Floyd, Florida State Representative Anthony Sabatini warned \"fake protesters\" in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0Sunday that an AR-15 rifle \"will be a very common sight upon illegal entry\" into businesses in Lake County.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the post, which included a photo of an AR-15, has garnered more than 18,000 likes and 9,000 retweets within the past day.\u00a0 \"The tweet is a warning. It warns people that in places like Lake County and any more medium-sized county or a rural county, you won't be able to just loot a business without consequences,\" Sabatini told\u00a0Mitchell.\u00a0 Sabatini, who also works part-time as an officer for the Florida Army National Guard, added that his message was a \"sincere warning\" that if people \"try to rob a business, they're going to be shot, period. It's just the way it works.\" Sabatini continued. \"Those who are peacefully protesting \u2014 first of all, all 330 million Americans, I think agree with them\u2026Nobody's defending the actions of that horrible police officer. But one thing I would tell them is to be very careful to disassociate with anyone who believes that breaking laws is justified to further their protest\u2026\"\u00a0 The Florida Democratic Party called on Twitter to remove Sabatini's account for violence but in a message sent to the Lake County representative, Twitter said it couldn't identify any violations of their rules. \"Although Twitter may think it's okay to incite violence, Florida will not stand for it,\" the FLDP\u00a0tweeted\u00a0Monday. \"Representative, be prepared to get voted out.\" GEORGIA Next week voters in Georgia will participate in their primary \u2013 one that has been delayed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While former Vice President Joe Biden will essentially run unopposed, the senate race bidding for the seat of incumbent Senator David Perdue has its fair share of excitement.\u00a0 The Democratic Primary for the seat remains unpredictable and crowded. One candidate, former Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson, spoke with\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0about the protests taking the country by storm and some of her proposals in addressing policing.\u00a0 \"What we have seen this last three and a half years in this current administration and the complicity of the Republicans is really a dissolving of those civic structures that kept us together as a people,\" Tomlinson said. She spoke about the need to amend the Civil Rights Act to address the issue of qualified immunity, that some say has prevented police from facing consequences for their alleged misconduct.\u00a0 \"We need to go ahead and legislatively take the responsibility of defining how much immunity is going to apply to the work the police officers do,\" Tomlinson said and added, \"no way is there immunity for these types of brutal killings.\" \u00a0Finally Tomlinson took a jab at one of her Democratic primary rivals, Jon Ossoff, who, along with another contender, Sarah Riggs Amico,\u00a0transferred their personal money\u00a0into their respective campaigns. \"I believe they made the miscalculation that this race can be run on money and ads.\" Tomlinson also added that she has continued to outraise her opponent in dollars raised from Georgia residents. IOWA Iowa Congressman Steve King is facing his\u00a0toughest primary race in years\u00a0on Tuesday, as Republicans who usually safeguard their incumbents have either shied away from defending him or backed his challengers, according to\u00a0CBS News\u00a0campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0 While King has\u00a0drawn headlines\u00a0for years for his\u00a0controversial comments,\u00a0the message from those hoping to unseat him has focused more on what King isn't able to do in Washington. In 2019, King was stripped of his House committee assignments after comments he made about white nationalism and white supremacy, which prompted a swift\u00a0bipartisan backlash.\u00a0 \"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\" King said in a New York Times\u00a0interview\u00a0in January 2019. Republican candidates and outside groups have honed in on King's waning influence. He has not only lost his committee assignments, but Republicans aren't even listening to his opinions, says Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Iowa Republican leader who has endorsed King's main primary opponent, Iowa state Senator Randy Feenstra.\u00a0 \"He can't even influence the committees because they're not accepting his voice,\" said Vander Plaats, who is president and CEO of the Family Leader, a Christian conservative group in Iowa. \"Just because you can scream conservative issues really, really loud in the middle of the street, the fact is, if nobody's listening to you, it doesn't make a difference anymore.\"\u00a0 King has chalked up his white nationalist comments in The New York Times to a misquote and \"weaponizing\" of the term. At a debate on Tuesday, he said the backlash and his removal were \"ginned up\" by the \"never-Trumpers.\" King has comfortably held the rural, conservative Iowan district since 2002, but in 2018 his seat was very much in play.\u00a0 First-time congressional candidate Democrat J.D. Scholten lost to King by just three points and Scholten is poised to be the Democratic nominee again in 2020. In deeply Republican Sioux County, where King got 72% of the vote in 2018 and 80% in 2016, Republican county chair Tammy Kobza is backing King.\u00a0 \"He's the one that will best defend America, its greatness and Donald Trump's agenda,\" she said. \u00a0 In addition to the U.S House primaries in Iowa, there is a Democratic Senate primary where four candidates are competing to take on Republican Senator Joni Ernst in November, notes\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0 The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has endorsed businesswoman Theresa Greenfield who has led the pack in total contributions in fundraising reports filed ahead of the primary. Greenfield is up against Eddie Mauro, Michael Franken, and Kimberly Graham. In total, Democratic candidates and outside groups have booked almost $11 million in ad reservations from the start of the year through the primary, according to data from Kantar/CMAG. The Senate Majority PAC has contributed the bulk of that figure by spending almost $7 million on ads supporting Greenfield. KANSAS Monday was the deadline for candidates to file to run in the U.S. Senate primary in Kansas, and after months of speculation Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not file to run, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0 Pompeo has told reporters numerous times over the past few months that his intention was to continue to serve as secretary of state but speculation continued in part because there is a large pool of relatively unknown Republican candidates and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he wished Pompeo would run. The Kansas secretary of state's office posted the\u00a0unofficial list of candidates\u00a0who have filed for the open seat, and the list includes 11 GOP candidates and two Democratic candidates.\u00a0 The seat will be open since Republican Senator Pat Roberts announced last summer he would retire at the end of his term. MICHIGAN Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said of President Trump's teleconference with governors that the call was \"deeply disturbing.\" She said at a press conference later Monday that \"[Mr. Trump] repeatedly and viciously attacked governors who are doing everything we can to keep the peace while we're working to save lives in a once in a generation pandemic.\" Whitmer added that the country is in a moment that requires \"empathy and humanity and unity.\" Whitmer also announced Monday she is rescinding Michigan's safer-at-home order and allowing businesses and restaurants to begin opening with capacity limits in the next week, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0 The controversial order was at times one of the strictest in the country and has drawn\u00a0legal challenges\u00a0from Republicans in the state legislature.\u00a0 Retailers will be able to open on June 4 and restaurants will be able to open on June 8. Restaurants will need to operate at 50% capacity and maintain six feet of distance between groups.\u00a0 Whitmer is also allowing day camps for children to open on June 8. Gyms and fitness centers will be allowed to conduct outdoor classes, practices, training sessions or games as long as \"coaches, spectators, and participants maintain six feet of distance from one another during these activities.\"\u00a0 Effective immediately, Michigan is also allowing groups of up to 100 people to gather outdoors as long as people practice social distancing. Whitmer is still requiring Michiganders to wear face masks while in enclosed public spaces and asking people to work from home as much as possible. Some businesses that involve \"close contact and shared surfaces\" will remain closed, including \"gyms, hair salons, indoor theaters, tattoo parlors, casinos, and similar establishments.\" In\u00a0testimony before a House subcommittee\u00a0on Tuesday, Whitmer is expected to criticize the Trump administration for the \"confusion\"\u00a0 in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic over the allocation of personal protective equipment (PPE) from the federal government, according to her prepared remarks obtained by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman.\u00a0 Her prepared remarks note that the state was directed to receive PPE from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), but Whitmer says there was confusion, since Mr. Trump had also suggested states think about buying equipment from private suppliers.\u00a0 \"As the state pursued PPE on the national and international markets, the lack of centralized coordination at the federal level created a counterproductive competition between states and the federal government to secure limited supplies, driving up prices and exacerbating existing shortages,\" her remarks read.\u00a0 Whitmer is also planning to call for clearer information from the federal government on testing supplies. The Democratic governor is expected to ask Congress for more federal assistance as the state faces a projected budget shortfall. Also in Michigan, the state's Republican party is calling on Whitmer and Senator Gary Peters to respond to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes that said people who support President Trump are racist.\u00a0 \"If you support Donald Trump, you are a racist. \u00a0Here is where it gets tricky and uncomfortable. \u00a0Donald Trump is a racist, and if being a racist is not a dealbreaker for you, you are the reason Black people are being murdered for being Black,\" Barnes said in a statement Sunday in the wake of nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd.\u00a0 \"We have arrived at the turning point, where silence is not an option. I hope we can all see the difference between protesting and rioting. \u00a0There is so much anger, I am angry also, but I am not moved by pleas for understanding. Here is what I want to see: I want the economic oppression of Black communities to stop, including holding the oppressors accountable. I want meaningful criminal justice reform. And I want law enforcement to actually do their jobs and prosecute hate crimes, and when law enforcement participates in racist conduct I want them held accountable \u2014 not by the prosecutors and colleagues they work with every day, but by an independent body, that they hold no sway over,\" Barnes' statement continued.\u00a0 Michigan Republican Party Chair Laura Cox responded to Barnes today, calling it \"inflammatory\" and accusing her of \"fanning the flames that are burning in our cities.\" \u00a0In a\u00a0statement\u00a0Cox said, \"Far too often, African-Americans receive unfair treatment from law enforcement, and we must do more as a nation to ensure that due process rights are guaranteed for all citizens regardless of race.\" She continued, \"However, Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes calling over 2 million Michiganders \"racist\" is unacceptable and only makes this tragedy worse.\" In a separate statement, Cox wrote, \"As representatives for all Michiganders, Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Senator Gary Peters must condemn Lavora Barnes' statement immediately. It is time to put the people of Michigan above politics.\" PENNSYLVANIA With the clock ticking on the deadline for counties to receive mail-in ballots in for the June 2 Pennsylvania primary, Governor Tom Wolf said he would extend their deadline by a week, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak.\u00a0 \"I can't do anything about the election date, but I am extending the time to actually get votes in,\" Wolf said in a press conference in Philadelphia. In the first year of no-excuse mail-in voting in the state, over 1.8 million Pennsylvanians applied to vote by mail, straining local elections boards with nearly 18 times the number of voters who applied to do so in the 2016 primary. As of Monday morning, counties had processed over a million mail-in ballots, but over a third remained. Wolf's decision came after counties and voting rights advocates argued voters who applied toward the deadline to apply for mail-in voting could end up without enough time to get their ballots in before election day. Pennsylvania residents had until May 26, a week before the primary election, to apply for mail-in ballots, leaving only a week for their ballot to be issued and returned. The issue has been playing out across court levels in the state.\u00a0 Counties across the state have installed drop-off boxes for mail-in ballots, and voters who applied for mail-in ballots but didn't mail back can file a provisional ballot in person. But there will be far fewer polling places in the state, since the State Department approved a 60% polling place cut across all counties and major polling place slashes for the state's largest counties, from 831 to 190 in Philadelphia and by nearly 90 percent in Allegheny. WISCONSIN The Wisconsin Supreme Court today agreed to hear a case that could take about 130,000 voters off of the state's voter rolls before the November election, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The case involves voters who the state believes may have moved and haven't responded to a mailing from October 2019 either confirming they stayed at a location or registered at a new address. The letter was initially sent to about 230,000 voters last fall, but some have confirmed their address, re-registered at a new address or been removed from the active voter list for other reasons.\u00a0 A county court initially ruled to remove the voters from the rolls, but the state appeals court overturned that decision in February. The Wisconsin Supreme Court deadlocked earlier this year on whether to hear the case before the appeals court weighed in.\u00a0 In late April, conservative Justice Dan Kelly announced he would be participating in the case once again, since the April election where he was on the ballot had passed. One interesting angle for the case is the schedule for filing briefs. The court is allowing up to 60 days for briefs to be filed and if the full time is used, there could be a new justice on the bench.\u00a0 Liberal Justice Jill Karofsky will be sworn in on the court on August 1 to replace Kelly. That would narrow the conservative edge on the court to a 4-3 majority. If the court rules to remove the voters, they could still re-register in time for the November election, but some activists have said it's more difficult to do so during the coronavirus pandemic. The case will be closely watched. since Wisconsin's 2016 presidential election was decided by about 23,000 votes.",

Morell and Blinken discuss a potential Biden administration's foreign policy priorities and its likely approach to top global security challenges, including climate change, armed conflicts, and strategic threats from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. Blinken also details the Vice President's likely approach to the U.S. intelligence, diplomatic and military communities. A corresponding interview request has been extended to the Trump White House, and is pending.\u00a0 HIGHLIGHTS:\u00a0 Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. INTELLIGENCE MATTERS \u2013 ANTONY BLINKEN PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS MICHAEL MORELL: Tony, welcome to Intelligence Matters. This is your second time on the program, but your first representing the Biden campaign, it is great to have you on the show. TONY BLINKEN: Thanks, Michael. Great to be with you. MICHAEL MORELL: I should say that we asked the Trump White House to provide a spokesperson on the President's foreign policy that we could produce as a separate episode that we would run after yours, Tony, and we are still waiting to hear from them. I just wanted my listeners to know that. So, Tony, we're glad you said yes. And maybe, Tony, the place to start is, because this is Intelligence Matters, I'd like to start with the Vice President as an intelligence consumer. Can you talk about what he was like as an intelligence consumer when he was the vice president? And how do you think he might approach the intelligence community as president? TONY BLINKEN: Michael, the word that comes to mind in terms of the Vice President's consumption of intelligence products is 'voracious.' And you know, when he was out of office, he told me early on the thing he missed the most was the morning PDB meeting, the President's Daily Brief, where he really felt that he knew what was going on in every corner of the world and something he felt very disconnected from when he was out of office. So, I suspect \u2013 no, I know \u2013 that as president, he would be a voracious consumer of intelligence. Unfortunately, that stands in rather stark contrast to President Trump. We've seen it reported again and again that at critical moments he either didn't read or ignored vital intelligence products. When he was getting warnings about COVID-19 in his President's Daily Brief, either he didn't read them or he ignored them. And similarly, reports that when he got intelligence about Russia paying bounties to the Taliban to kill our troops, same thing: either didn't read it or ignored it. That would not happen in a Joe Biden administration. MICHAEL MORELL: Tony, you were his National Security Adviser during the first term. Did he get the PDB before the session with the president or was that the first time he was seeing it, when the president was there? TONY BLINKEN: No, no. He got it before. He typically \u2013 he certainly had the book before. On occasion, he'd get an actual briefing of his own beforehand and in fact, I'd get called in sometimes before we went to see the president, where he wanted to get into greater depth on something. But typically he had read the the book before the meeting with the president. MICHAEL MORELL: Do you think he thinks about having to \u2013 a little bit of a difficult question \u2013 but, do you think he thinks about having to repair the relationship between the IC and the person who sits in the White House? TONY BLINKEN: In short, yes. And unfortunately, that repair mission is probably one that will have to happen across the board with a multiplicity of government agencies that have been grievously politicized by this administration, turning them into instruments of the president's personal interests as opposed to the national interest. And unfortunately, the intelligence community is probably right at the top of the list. MICHAEL MORELL: How do you do that? How do you go about fixing that? And I understand that's, you know, going to be something that's going to be done across the board. But how do you go about doing that in practice? TONY BLINKEN: First thing, Michael, is to send a very clear and direct message that a President Biden will not politicize intelligence, will insist that truth always be spoken to power. Will demand that people bring their best analysis and best judgment and not in any way shape it to what they perceive to be the political desires or political interests of the incumbent. And I think that's a signal, a message he would send immediately. And of course, what flows from that, too, is the people that you appoint to lead these agencies. He would insist that that be their standard and he would insist that they communicate the same thing to the men and women working with them and working for the country. So it really starts on Day One with the message you send, what you say, who you ask to to lead these agencies. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Tony, I want to get into a set of specific issues and kind of run them by you, but maybe a handful of kind of general questions before we get to the specifics. And the first is, the Vice President's vision for what a Biden administration's foreign policy would look like. I guess it comes down to, how does he think about America's role in the world? TONY BLINKEN: So, look, I would sum it up in three words: leadership, cooperation and democracy. Which also sums up the profound differences between President Trump and Vice President Biden. I don't think the choice could be clearer or the contrast starker. So bear with me for a second, Michael. On leadership, whether we like it or not, the world just doesn't organize itself. And until this administration, the U.S. had played a lead role in doing a lot of that organizing, helping to write the rules, to shape the norms and animate the institutions that govern relations among nations. What we have now is a president who has unfortunately abdicated that responsibility, putting us in retreat from our allies, from international organizations, from hard-won agreements.\u00a0 And here's the problem. When we're not engaged, when we don't lead, then one or two things is likely to happen. Either some other country tries to take our place \u2013 but probably not in a way that advances our interests or values \u2013 or no one does. And then you get chaos or a vacuum filled by bad things before it's filled by good things. Either way, that's bad for us.\u00a0 So Joe Biden would reassert American leadership, leading with our diplomacy. We'd actually show up again, day in, day out. But to engage the world, not as it was in 2009 or even in 2017 when we left it, but as it is and as we anticipate it will become: rising powers, new actors super-empowered by technology and information, who we have to bring along if we're going to make progress.\u00a0 And I think he would act with a combination of humility and confidence. Humility, because most of the world's problems are not about us, even as they affect us. We can't just flip a switch to solve them. But also confidence, because when we act at our best, we still have a greater ability than any other country on Earth to mobilize others.\u00a0 But cooperation here is critical. And that's the second piece: not a single one of the big challenges we face, whether it's climate change or mass migration or technological disruption or pandemic disease, can be met by any one country acting alone, even one as powerful as our own. And there's no wall high enough or wide enough to contain these threats. But at the very time we need to find new ways to cooperate and bring other countries along, by nearly every measure, the credibility and influence of the United States under President Trump are in freefall. You've seen the most recent Pew global survey: People have more confidence in Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs than they do in the president of the United States. So we'll have to pick up the pieces of this carnage wrought by President Trump, salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and then mobilize the country and our allies to meet new challenges.\u00a0 Final piece is this: democracy. It still reflects who we are, how we see ourselves, and at least until recently, how the world has seen us, but it's being challenged. And the strength of our own democracy at home is directly tied to our ability to be a force for progress in the world and to mobilize that collective action I was talking about.\u00a0 But here's the problem. President Trump's daily assault on our own democracy, on its institutions, on its values, on its people, that's deeply tarnished our ability to lead. At the same time, the flip side is other democracies are a source of strength for our country, especially when we act together. But you know this, Michael, democracy has been in retreat. Freedom House ranks countries and it's done it for decades. Of the 40 or so countries that were ranked 'Fully Free' from the 80s to the 90s to the early 2000s, half have fallen backwards. There's a democratic recession and autocracies from Russia to China are trying to exploit our difficulties. And yet here again, the very moment democracies look to the United States to be leader of the free world, we have a president who, by embracing autocrats and dissing Democrats, seems to have suited up for the other side. So I think what Joe Biden would do would be to renew our democracy at home and then work to revitalize our alliances and partnerships with democracies around the world. You'll see an America that is leading not just by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. And that starts with democracy. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Tony, this rebuilding ties with allies. You know, I still talk to a lot of former foreign government officials who I used to work with. And one of the questions that they have is how can a President Biden assure us that we're not going to go through the same thing again in 2024 or 2028? Right \u2013 How can we make sure that we that the bet we put on the United States is going to be a long-term one? TONY BLINKEN: Look, there's no guaranteed answer. But I will say this, Michael. So much hinges on November 3rd. From my own conversations with folks around the world, what I'm getting is, if Joe Biden is elected on November 3rd, I think a lot of people will see the last four years as an aberration. Conversely, if President Trump is knowingly re-elected, given all that we know about his leadership and the way he engages abroad, that will, I think, set us back for as long as I can look into the future.\u00a0 So, so much hinges on the very fact of the election itself and who wins and who loses. Much will be taken from that about, you know, people's sense of where America is and where it's going. Having said that, and in fairness, I do think that President Trump is as much a symptom as he is a cause of some of the challenges that people see now. And he may also be an accelerant, but the fact is there are big underlying challenges that predated President Trump and that will succeed him when he leaves office. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, which kind of brings us to to \u2013 you know, there's 24 hours in a day, right, and resources are finite. So to what extent does foreign policy get constrained by the problems at home? The acute problems of the pandemic and the economy and the more chronic problems of race and income inequality and health care, et cetera, et cetera? TONY BLINKEN: Well, look, we have to face facts, which is the 800-pound gorilla is COVID-19. And it is the gravest challenge the United States has faced since World War II. It's killed more Americans than died during all of World War I and killed more Americans than perished in every war we've fought since 1945 plus 9/11, combined. And of course, we've got a recession that it unleashed the deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Millions of Americans unemployed, entire sectors of our economy threatened with ruin. And then we've got so many tails that could wag the COVID dog. And I remember we were talking about this months ago: an emerging markets debt crisis, food insecurity, migratory upheavals, humanitarian disasters. And then, on top of that, more protectionism, more nationalism, more xenophobia, all of which can ricochet back in different ways on the United States.\u00a0 So in a sense, the pandemic itself is a national security crisis of the first order. But I think that getting out from under the COVID rock actually requires asserting American leadership, not running away from it. Think about it this way: look at some of the previous global crises \u2013 none of this magnitude but still very significant \u2013 that we had to deal with; HIV/AIDS, the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Ebola. In each and every instance, the US led the way to international cooperation and coordination. The Bush administration, with HIV/AIDS, doing a remarkable job of saving hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of lives. The Obama administration, again, with the financial crisis and Ebola. We seized the G7, the G20, international financial institutions.\u00a0 This time out, the United States, when COVID broke, actually was chairing the G7. We didn't even call a meeting. It took the French President, Macron, to convene that group. And the G20 has been totally ineffectual in the absence of our own engagement. So I think these two things go together. And the other problem is the world doesn't take a time out because of COVID. So I don't think we'd have the luxury of approaching things sequentially. We have to be able to walk and chew a lot of gum at the same time: getting COVID under control, but also dealing with some of its repercussions and dealing with the other challenges that have not gone away just because COVID is striking everywhere. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Tony, the second kind of broad question I wanted to ask you is about the issues of the tools of statecraft, right. The military, the diplomatic community, our economic power. How does the Vice President feel about the health of those tools and even more importantly, about the balance among them in terms of how they've been used over the last couple of decades? TONY BLINKEN: So I think he'd tell you that where the balance is not good and that there is overreliance on the military tool and an under-reliance on, for example, on diplomacy. And that would change in a Biden administration.\u00a0 Let me just talk about the piece that that I know best, and that's the diplomatic piece and in particular the State Department. So we heard some talk about \"swagger\" at the State Department, but unfortunately, it's more like a stagger. As I hear it from so many foreign service officers and civil servants, we have a Department that's demoralized and decimated by departures and vacancies in the in the most senior ranks. And we have a leadership that does not seem to have the backs of its own people when they are literally attacked by the President of the United States. Everything is politicized with loyalty lists, efforts to find so-called traitors or \"Deep Staters.\"\u00a0 There was just \u2013 you may have seen this. There's a major survey of federal employees that's, I believe, undertaken every year. The one last year, 2019, found that political coercion was rampant in certain bureaus in the State Department. And here's a statistic that left me with my jaw dropping: within the State Department's legal bureau, when asked if about the State Department's leadership, 34 percent said the department's leadership did not have high levels of honesty and integrity, versus 0 percent in 2016 when John Kerry was running the Department and Barack Obama was president.\u00a0 I've worked with foreign service officers, as I know you have, in my case, for nearly 25 years. And for virtually all of them, I could not begin to tell you who's a Democrat, who's a Republican, who's an independent or something else. I can tell you that, across the board, they're remarkable professionals who dedicate their careers to serving our country, not one party or another. So I think what you see under a Biden administration is diplomacy as our tool of first resort. The world's greatest power deserves to have the world's very best diplomatic corps. And I think you'd see us support and invest in reforms to make the Department more strategic, more modern, more agile, more effective. And we'd be treating our diplomats with respect, not contempt. And I would hope and believe and expect that we would not only expand and reform the foreign service, but do it in a way that reflects the diversity and richness of the country it represents. MICHAEL MORELL: OK, Tony, let's shift to some specific issues and let me just throw them out one at a time and get you to talk about how a President Biden might approach them. And I'll put what I think the most important one is, first, which is climate change. TONY BLINKEN: Yeah. So Michael here it's interesting, I think this is a reflection of what we were talking about a minute ago. When it comes to climate change, I think that success at home is directly tied to our ability to lead effectively abroad. Success can breed success and strengthen our credibility. When we're actually modeling good behavior, and when we get results, other countries are more likely to follow our lead.\u00a0 Conversely, when we fall short of the mark as, for example, on COVID-19 or racial justice, it's a lot harder to change someone else's conduct. So, in the case of climate change: we're 15 percent of global emissions, so by definition, we can do everything right, but if the rest of the world, responsible for 85 percent of emissions, fails to do the right thing, we can't solve the problem. But, we will be a lot more effective in getting others to do the right thing if we're actually doing it ourselves.\u00a0 So under a Biden administration, I think you'd see us urgently embrace much greater ambition to meet the scope of the challenge, ensure that we achieve a 100 percent clean energy economy and get to net zero emissions no later than than 2050. A series of executive orders on Day One that go well beyond what the Obama-Biden administration did to put us on the right track, working with Congress to get legislation to establish an enforcement mechanism that includes milestone targets no later than the end of the Vice President's first term in 2025. Historic investments in clean energy and climate research and innovation, incentivizing the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations across the economy, and building a stronger, more resilient nation with the investments we make in infrastructure that are climate-ready. And as we do that, we're in a much better position to rally the rest of the world to meet the challenge. So the Vice President is committed to rejoining Paris on Day One, but then going further than that, leading an effort to get every major country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets and working to make sure those commitments are actually transparent, enforceable, and also trying to make sure that countries can't cheat by using some of our economic leverage and the power of our example as well. So climate change would be fully integrated into our foreign policy and national security strategies, as well as our approach to trade. But you've got to bring the domestic and the international piece together if you're going to succeed. MICHAEL MORELL: OK, Tony, China.\u00a0 TONY BLINKEN: So that's the big one. And look, I think we all recognize China poses a growing challenge, arguably the biggest challenge, we face from another nation state: economically, technologically, militarily, even diplomatically. And, you know, the relationship has adversarial aspects, competitive aspects, but also cooperative ones. So I think the question we have to ask ourselves is, 'What is the most effective strategy to protect and advance our security, our prosperity, our values when it comes to engaging with China?' And I think the Vice President would tell you that we have to start by putting ourselves in a position of strength from which to engage China so that the relationship moves forward more on our terms than on theirs. Here's the problem: right now, by every key metric, China's strategic position is stronger and ours is weaker as a result of President Trump's leadership. Think about it this way: President Trump helped China advance its own key strategic goals, weakening American alliances, leaving a vacuum in the world for China to fill, abandoning our values and giving China a green light to trample on human rights and democracy from Xinjiang to Hong Kong. And maybe worst of all, debasing our own democracy by attacking its institutions, its people, its values every day, and so reducing its appeal.\u00a0 It's another way of saying, Michael, that in many ways the challenge posed by China is almost less about their strength and more about our own self-inflicted weaknesses. The challenge is about us. And so that means we have to focus on the competitiveness of our own economy and workers, the strength of our own democracy and political system, the vibrancy of our own alliances and partnerships, and the assertion of our own values, all of which President Trump has done so much to undermine, but all of which are actually within our control.\u00a0 So that's where the Vice President would focus first, in making those investments. And that's also, by the way, the best basis upon which to advance cooperation with China on issues of mutual concern, whether it's climate change, whether it's nonproliferation or global health. MICHAEL MORELL: And then how confident are you, Tony, that if we do all of that, and in particular if we rebuild the alliances and build a kind of coalition that we can say to China, 'You're welcome to exert more influence in the world if you live by the rules and international order, and If not, we're going to push back on you.' How confident are you that we can change their approach? TONY BLINKEN: Look, there's no guarantee. But, for example, on trade, when we're acting alone, when we manage to pick fights with with our partners and allies who are similarly situated when it comes to China. And so they're not with us and we're trying to deal with this alone. We're about 25 percent of the world's GDP. When we have our partners and allies with us, we're 50 or 60 percent of the world's GDP. That's a lot harder for China to ignore. And we have many big issues, but we have one of the most, I think, defining issues of our time will be the fault line between techno-democracies on the one hand, and techno-autocracies, like China, on the other hand, and whose rules, whose norms, whose values \u2013 to the extent technology infused with values \u2013carry the day is going to make a huge difference in the lives of people across this planet. We have to do a much better job in leading, coordinating, working with the other techno-democracies to make sure that we carry the day and not China. MICHAEL MORELL: OK, Russia. With the realization that a President Biden would be facing a Vladimir Putin, who actually worked to prevent President Biden's election. TONY BLINKEN: So I came back across something a few weeks ago that I that I copied and made sure that I kept with me. And I just want to take a second; I'll read it to you. It's a quote. And it reads as follows: \"At the bottom of the Kremlin's neurotic view of world affairs is traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity. Russia's rulers have invariably sensed that their rule was relatively archaic. To this was added, as Russia came into contact with an economically advanced West, a fear of more competent, more powerful, more highly organized societies. For this reason, Russia's rulers have always feared foreign penetration. Russians will participate officially in international organizations where they see opportunity of extending power or inhibiting or diluting the power of others. Efforts will be made to disrupt Western national self-confidence, to hamstring measures of national defense, to increase social and industrial unrest, to stimulate all forms of disunity. Poor will be set against rich, Black against White, young against old, newcomers against established residents.\"\u00a0 Well, that quote was written in 1946 by an individual by the name of George Kennan in his famous long telegram and it is eerily on point to what we're experiencing now.\u00a0 We've got a president, unfortunately, who's making things worse, not better. When President Trump stands with Vladimir Putin on the world stage and takes his word about Russia's attacks on our elections over that of our intelligence agencies, that exacerbates the problem. When we have a president who is told that Russia may be putting bounties on the heads of our troops in Afghanistan and does nothing \u2013 in fact, worse than nothing, by his own acknowledgement, speaking to President Putin at least six times after he got that report and not raising it, not confronting him and even inviting President Putin to Washington and Russia back into the G7 \u2013\u00a0 we have a real, fundamental problem.\u00a0 So I would say quickly that a President Biden would be in the business of confronting Mr. Putin for his aggressions, not embracing him. Not trashing NATO, but strengthening its deterrence, investing in new capabilities to deal with challenges in cyberspace, in outer space, under the sea, A.I., electronic warfare, and give robust security assistance to countries like Ukraine, Georgia, the Western Balkans. Impose real costs where we need to; coordinated sanctions, exposing corruption, being very clear and very specific with President Putin about what he risks, but also maybe what he might gain through trade, through investment, through a seat at the table. If Russia changes its conduct to relieve some of its growing dependence on China.\u00a0 We've got to build our own resilience by hardening election infrastructure, getting dark money out of politics, pushing tech companies to deal with disinformation. But we also have to deal at the same time \u2013 and we can \u2013 with strategic stability. The Vice President believes we should extend New START and look for other avenues to advance strategic stability with Russia, even as we confront Mr. Putin's aggressive actions. MICHAEL MORELL: Tony, North Korea. The North Korean nuclear threat threat is greater today than it was in January of 2017 when the Vice President left office. TONY BLINKEN: Look, our goal is clear. A Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons. It takes very smart, very tough diplomacy to get there, working closely with allies and partners.\u00a0 I would be the first to acknowledge: this is a hard problem. But we managed to get success with Iran \u2013 different details that matter, but a hard problem, too. I still think we have opportunities to move in the same direction with North Korea. The problem is, as you mentioned, under President Trump's watch, the problem, already hard, has gotten more, not less dangerous.\u00a0 We've had a president who's veered radically from bombastic threats to exchanging what he himself called \"love letters\" with one of the world's worst tyrants. We've had three empty summits with no preparation with Kim Jong Un. The Art of the Deal really turned into the 'Art of the Steal' in Kim's favor.\u00a0 One of the world's worst tyrants gets equal billing on the world stage with the President of the United States. And to boot, we suspend military exercises with our allies to appease them. We take our foot off the pedal of economic pressure. What do we get in return? Worse than nothing. North Korea has actually increased its nuclear arsenal and its missile capabilities, and despite that, the President actually said to the American people, 'There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.'\u00a0 I got to say, lying to Americans about our own security in matters of war and peace may be the worst of the president's adversarial relationship with the truth. I don't know, maybe he thinks that, like COVID-19, North Korea's nukes will somehow miraculously disappear.\u00a0 So the hard part is this. We have to work closely with allies like South Korea and Japan and press China to build genuine economic pressure to squeeze North Korea to get it to the negotiating table. We need to cut off its various avenues and access to to resources \u2013 something we were doing very vigorously at the end of the Obama-Biden administration. That takes a lot of time, a lot of preparation, a lot of hard work. But again, it can pay off.\u00a0 It did get us the Iran nuclear deal, which was working until President Trump tore it up. And I think we could get us to a verifiable agreement with North Korea. Now, I'm not under any illusions. I don't think North Korea is going to be abandoning the totality of its arsenal tomorrow. So this is something that would have to proceed in stages and phases, but it is doable with sustained, focused foreign policy. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Tony: Iran. You mentioned Iran. It's obviously on the list here. TONY BLINKEN: It sure is, and there again, unfortunately, we have, I think, a terrible indictment of the current administration's foreign policy. When President Trump walked away from the Iran deal, an agreement that, again, was verifiably working to block Iran's path to nuclear weapons, or at least to the fissile material necessary to to make a weapon, he promised a better deal. And, of course, the opposite has happened.\u00a0 Iran is building back its nuclear capability. President Trump effectively freed Iran of its commitments under the nuclear agreement. And so now it's enriching uranium at higher levels, its stockpiling more. It's using more advanced centrifuges. And the breakout time necessary for Iran to have enough nuclear material to fuel a weapon has decreased from more than a year, as it was under the so-called JCPOA, to a handful of months. And all of this has happened under President Trump's watch. And he has no plan that I can discern to deal with it. So now fast forward \u2013 and in the process of doing this, we managed to alienate virtually all of our key partners who wanted to stick with the deal. And they've now spent most of their energy and efforts trying to keep the deal alive instead of working with us to confront some of Iran's behavior, egregious behavior, in other parts of the world and in other areas.\u00a0 We've had the most recent chapter play out just in the last few days, the conventional arms embargo that expires in October. The United States launched an effort to extend it indefinitely at the United Nations. We got a grand total of one out of the 15 members of the Security Council to support us. Russia and China got to keep their vetoing try. It was a diplomatic debacle. Now we're invoking the sanctions snapback provisions in the Iran nuclear agreement negotiated by President Obama and his administration. There's just one catch: those snapback provisions to put sanctions back can be invoked under the terms of the agreement by a participant to the agreement. And in pulling out of the Iran deal, the administration literally titled its press release, \"Ending U.S. participation in the JCPOA.\"\u00a0 So our partners and allies are saying, 'Hey, you can't snap back the sanctions. You're no longer a participant in the agreement.\" So if Joe Biden is President, if Iran returns to compliance with the nuclear agreement, we would do the same. But then we would use that as a platform, working with our allies and partners to try to strengthen and lengthen it. And that also has the merits, I think, of putting us back on the same page with our allies and partners so that we can more effectively push back together against Iran's other destabilizing activities and make sure that when it comes to those activities, Iran is isolated, not the United States. MICHAEL MORELL: And then, Tony, the last issue on my list \u2013 a lot of people have different names for it. But I call it \"Endless wars.\" So, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, any number of places where U.S. troops are on the ground involved in some way. How does the Vice President think about that issue? TONY BLINKEN: He's been very clear about this, and he's said that large-scale, open-ended deployment of large, standing U.S. forces in conflict zones with no clear strategy should end and will end under his watch.\u00a0 He's very focused on the conditions under which you would actually deploy U.S. forces. Vital national interests need to be at stake, or maybe it's a commitment to to a treaty ally. We'd have to have a clearly-defined strategy and end game. And we need the informed consent of the American people, ideally through their representatives in Congress.\u00a0 But we also need to distinguish between, for example, these endless wars with the large-scale, open-ended deployment of U.S. forces with, for example, discrete, small-scale, sustainable operations, maybe led by Special Forces to support local actors. This is something, Michael, as you know very well, we worked on with the by, with and through strategy in the Obama-Biden administration, and it actually worked very effectively in Iraq and Syria to defeat ISIS.\u00a0 In Syria, at its height, I think we had about 2,000 U.S. forces, mostly special operators, in support for them. They leveraged 60 to 70 thousand Syrian democratic forces, Kurds and Arabs, who did the heavy lifting and the heavy fighting to defeat ISIS and take away the geographic caliphate. That's smart, that's strong, that's sustainable, that's effective. So I think we have to, in ending the endless wars, we also have to be careful not to paint with too broad a brush stroke. There are ways, times, means by which we need to be able to use force, but very, very carefully cabined, as I suggested a minute ago. MICHAEL MORELL: Tony, you've been great with your time. Last question: You know the Vice President better than anyone else when it comes to foreign policy and national security. Tell us how you think, as Commander in Chief, a President Biden would think about a decision to put U.S. servicemen and women in harm's way. TONY BLINKEN: Well, you know, one of the most, I think, painful moments in recent weeks has been the reporting about what President Trump thinks about our men and women in uniform, the folks who sign up to put their lives on the line for this country. Calling them, as has been reported, \"suckers,\" \"losers.\" And of course, on the record in his own voice, he called John McCain a \"loser\" for becoming a prisoner of war. And we talked about the the incident with the reported Russian bounties on our forces in in Afghanistan. And the President did nothing. I don't think the contrast could be any starker on this issue when it comes to the difference between President Trump and a President Biden. Joe Biden knows what it's like to send his own child into harm's way, as he did when his son Beau was deployed to Iraq during the Obama-Biden administration. It's personal to him and I think better than most, he can, as a president, he would be able to put himself in the shoes of mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers, of children who have a loved one deployed.\u00a0 And one of the things I've heard the Vice President say for a long time is, \"It boils down to this: Government has many obligations, but only one sacred obligation, and that's to train and equip and protect our troops when they go off to battle and to look after them and their families when they come home.\" That basic obligation, that sacred obligation, as he calls it, that would guide a President Biden's decision making when it comes to our men and women in uniform. MICHAEL MORELL: Tony, thank you very much for all of that and thank you very much for joining this hour for joining us. I hope this encourages the Trump team to provide a person to outline President Trump's thinking on these important foreign policy and national security issues. But thank you very much for taking the time today to join us. TONY BLINKEN: Michael, thanks for having me. Great to be with you.",

McLaughlin and Morell focus on tensions within the U.S.-China relationship that the outbreak has exacerbated, as well as efforts by adversaries like Russia, Iran and North Korea to further destabilize the world order. McLaughlin shares views on the value of leadership to coordinate a response, and voices concerns about a potential void left by an America-First policy. \"Intelligence Matters\" will dedicate several forthcoming episodes to understanding the fundamentals and national security implications of COVID-19. \"Intelligence Matters\" will dedicate several forthcoming episodes to understanding the fundamentals and national security implications of COVID-19. INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - JOHN MCLAUGHLIN CORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELL PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON MICHAEL MORELL: John, welcome: Welcome to Intelligence Matters. In fact, welcome back to Intelligence Matters. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Thank you, Michael. Great to be with you. MICHAEL MORELL: So this is the second time that you've been on the show. The first time was May 2018. In fact, it was late May; it was around Memorial Day. And you'll remember that we talked about the organization, the C.I.A. Officers Memorial Fund that was created after 9/11 to take care of the families of C.I.A. officers who were lost in the line of duty. And I would encourage our listeners that, if you haven't listened to that episode, you should go back and do so. It's one of my favorite episodes. I also want to let people know that we're in the midst of a series of episodes on the implications of coronavirus. So we started with Dr. David Agus, a CBS News medical contributor, to talk about the virus itself and what we know and what we don't know. And last week we had Lisa Monaco talking about how a White House, how a government, should manage this sort of thing. And today we have you, John, to talk about the national security implications. And I mentioned to you in an email that I have a lot of questions about specific issues, ranging from strategic competition with China and potential political instability in important countries, and all sorts of things. But I'd like to start by asking you if you have any kind of broad, cross-cutting thoughts at this point about what the kind of long-term implications of this might be for the world and international affairs, national security, et cetera? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Well, a couple things, Michael. You know, I think you have to begin with something that I would not normally begin with. And that is something that you and I will be familiar with from our time in our former profession where we always would want to know at the very beginning, \"What is it we don't know?\" about something. And I think we're struggling a bit with the fact that there are more uncertainties about this situation than we typically have. You may have been through some of them with the medical expert. But obviously it bears repeating that we don't know yet whether this is a seasonal phenomenon, a year-round phenomenon, whether we'll have a second wave or a third wave. We don't know yet when we'll get a vaccine. That's the second thing. People are saying a year to 18 months perhaps. We don't really know the origins of it: a lot of controversy about that. So you have to start by saying there are so many unknowns here that what we say about the longer-term consequences are inevitably subject to revision and speculation. That said, some things are fairly obvious. There's a drop in output in the world to the point where I think most economists are now projecting a fairly serious plunge in growth next year. I've seen estimates as high as a 12% plunge in growth, when people were expecting really a rather smooth economy globally for the next year. Another thing that's been going on for a long period of time, and that has been highlighted in some even intelligence publications, is a kind of global-- how to put it: a kind of global dissatisfaction with government, which we see in a lot of different arenas and countries. That's probably going to increase as a result of this because most countries are looking at their response to this, and questioning whether their systems are performing as they should be. There's also-- another big, huge issue globally is simply demographic change. You know, the world's going to hit something like 8.3, 8.4 billion people in a couple of decades. Urbanization is increasing: 65% is what most people are expecting in a couple of decades, 65% of people living in cities. So it's already a very urban globe: 55% or so of the population of the world in cities. That means that it's another way in which this is going to be hard to combat. Because social distancing is pretty easy where I'm living right now in Virginia. But it's awfully hard in a place like Karachi or Cairo. So there's that. Global order: How do we think about global order? Well, global order essentially boils down to rules, institutions, borders, things like that. This thing presents a challenge to global order in ways that we hadn't really considered previously on just multiple levels. If you look just at-- let's just take something like maritime roles and challenges. Everyone knows about China's challenge in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, and so forth. But it's kind of striking that, at this point in the Pacific, I think we have really no carriers operating. One is the Roosevelt, which is out of commission because of the outbreak there. Another one is in maintenance, and another one is on quarantine. And so, at this point, China has the only aircraft carrier operating in that region. MICHAEL MORELL: Isn't that something? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: That, in itself, is kind of emblematic of how it has affected the U.S. ability to project power. And I know our defense department will say that they're up to any mission, and so forth. And that's kind of what we expect of them and what they typically say. But, in truth, I think our ability to project power is somewhat limited. And then on this whole issue of global order, obviously China and Russia see opportunities here to increase their influence around the world, even as they struggle with the consequences of this virus for them. So one could go on about the broader strategic challenges and the global challenges. Or just the supply network that's interrupted in multiple ways: just medical supplies. I mean, as an economist, you know better than anyone that the economy globally works well when things are unimpeded and moving freely. But the virus has kind of acted maybe like a circuit-breaker in terms of breaking the flow of goods in an environment where almost everything is a product of multinational contribution, from the iPhone to automobiles to the medicines that we take. One of the struggles right now being, of course, that many of the components for what we need to do testing happen to come from China. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: You know? Eight to ninety percent of our antibiotics come from China. Most generic drugs, 60% to 70%, are made in India, but they get many of their components from China. And because everyone needs these things, and because other things are impeding the flow of goods, that's also off balance at this point. I should stop there because the global implications are almost beyond imagining. MICHAEL MORELL: John, let me pick up on a couple of things that you said. And the first is the \"growing dissatisfaction\" that you mentioned with regard to how populations might be seeing their governments in terms of how they're dealing with the outbreak itself, or how they're dealing with the economic consequences. And so I'm wondering, sort of after the fact, as people are allowed to, or as they feel comfortable going back out onto the streets, if we're going to see calls for political change in a number of countries, calls for political change that could even become violent. How do you react to that? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: You know, I'm not thinking so much of violence. I'm thinking more a matter of diminished trust in government. If you look at China, for example, and it's always hard for us to imagine any really consequential discontinuity in China. People tend to think China will just be China, and they'll continue being the way they are. Well, it's now pretty obvious that China waited six, seven days, a week or so, before they informed the population that they had a serious problem. That's come out in some leaked documents that have appeared in the media. It's also obvious, and been reported, that China is restricting publication of research that has been done in China on the origins and the development and spread of the virus. So given that China already has a problem with Hong Kong feeling oppressed and speaking out about it; and given that Taiwan handled this a lot more skillfully than mainland China did, you can imagine in the aftermath of this that there will be some strong discontent in China about how the government handled all of this. You know, in our own country, surveys by the Pew organization, a reliable public opinion surveyor: If you went back to 1964, 75%, 76% of Americans said they trusted the American Government to do the right thing. That's now down to 17%. MICHAEL MORELL: Wow. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: That's before coronavirus, before coronavirus. So you start off with, in the United States, a kind of diminished trust in government that has built over a long period of time. And you just have to watch the news every day to realize that we're at a moment here where I think the average citizen is not quite sure what to believe about everything from masks to the availability of testing. Look at Russia: It's clear Putin is trying to stay out of the public sight and delegating most of the public decisions on this to his advisors and his spokespeople and the Mayor of Moscow, and so forth. This is nothing he wants to be particularly associated with as the responsible authority. So I'm not thinking of violence so much. But here's another one, and I'll stop at this point. If you look at the developing world, where we don't have a real-- at least I have not been able to find a real empirical sense of what's going on there with the spread of the virus. Largely because in some cases it's authoritarian governments, as in Iran, who aren't publicly acknowledging the depth of their problem. And in other places it's just inefficiency, or so forth. So I mentioned demographics a few minutes ago: With the burgeoning population in the world, only two to three percent of that population increase is going to occur in the developed world. This is going on every year. So in the less-developed world, you have burgeoning populations, governments that already have trouble providing services, and now you've got the coronavirus on top of it. I don't think we have the slightest idea what's happening in countries that have no ability to do social distancing and the potential, because of many of them being in the Southern Hemisphere, for all of that to coalesce into a second wave that comes north again. We've got to think about that. But in those societies themselves, you can see, because the stresses are already there, ethnic turmoil, migration, all of that. That's probably all going to be increased by this virus because it's a problem that they're not prepared to handle. MICHAEL MORELL: So, John, do you have a sense of how this will impact the already-existing trend away from democracy and toward authoritarianism in the world? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Well, I gather it's already started in places like Hungary where Orban has taken a lot of power unto himself, to the point where the European Union has scolded him for exceeding the rules of the European Union when it comes to democracy. You have a sense that certainly it's not going to enhance democracy in places like China or Russia or Egypt, for example, or Iran. So, yes, I think the net result is probably going to be strengthening of authoritarian societies, if they can survive it, going back to the uncertainties I mentioned at the very beginning. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, you get the sense that publics are willing to give up some of their rights in these kinds of situations, and are willing to give more power to the executive in order to protect them. And executives like Orban, and it's also happened in some other places now, look to take advantage of those situations and grab power. And probably don't plan on giving it back after their crisis subsides. So I worry about that. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Well, it's a war. It's a war, and in wartime you typically find that in societies, even in democratic societies. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So I want to come back to the point you made about the origins of the virus. You mentioned it a couple of times, and there's the whole issue of man-made versus naturally occurring. I'm not really interested in that debate, but the issue of, \"Was this a virus that was being researched at the Wuhan Institute? And did it leak out accidentally?\" The Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, has been pretty strong about his views on that with regard to the possibilities. And I wonder to what extent that might be overstating the evidence that we have? Just wondering what your thoughts are about the origin question and then why it's an important question. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: I think that's overstating the knowledge on this. Again, you know, I'm not reading classified material here. But you and I can both usually read between the lines of press stories that talk about intelligence. And the ones I've read, and this is obviously the result of someone in the policy community, I guess, talking about what they've seen in the intelligence, the intelligence community at this point seems undecided about it. Or at the point of saying they cannot yet get to the bottom of it. And so I'd go, for now, with the idea that this is not certain enough to be confident. And that seems to be what people other than Secretary Pompeo think. Certainly, the defense secretary, Esper, has come down on the side of, \"We're just not sure yet. We're looking into it.\" Why is it important? I think it's important on two levels: First, I've seen nothing that tells me that this was created in a lab. Perhaps it was, but I've seen nothing that affirms that confidently. Most of what I've seen indicates that it came from a bat that infected an animal that, in turn, was passed along to human beings, one way or another. We don't know yet whether that's true, and that's impeded a bit by the fact that China has started to clamp down on the publications of its research institutes on this. So it's only important because of what it tells us about the trustworthiness of what the Chinese are putting out on this. And the importance of that is that we can't get through this, in my personal opinion, without a fairly transparent and cooperative relationship with China. I mean, the distinguishing feature of this virus is that it requires a global response because it doesn't know any boundaries. And unless we work together on this, we are not going to be able to beat it in an efficient manner. So it matters, as a matter of confidence in dealing with China, that we understand its origins. And the sooner we get to the bottom of that, and they help us get to the bottom of that, the better. MICHAEL MORELL: So I couldn't agree more with your characterization that we need a global response. But it sure looks like every nation has turned inward and is worried about itself inside of its borders, with not a lot of folks being interested in coordinating some sort of global response. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, well, we have to think about this. Look at the way the world reacted to the Spanish Flu in 1918-19: Again, nationalism triumphed after that. And within 20 years we were back at war in the Second World War. So the question here is, \"Do we deal with this in the way the world dealt with it after World War I?\" \"Or do we deal with it in the way that the United States dealt with turmoil and trouble after World War II, when we created, largely with U.S. leadership, all of the institutions, multinational: ranging from the U.N. to NATO to the Bretton Woods Agreement, and so forth and so on, the IMF, creating, essentially, the foundation of what became a globalized economy and a globalized network?\" Which of those models prevails here? And to get to a globalized model, you need leadership. Someone has to lead it. And I don't see any country capable of leading it other than the United States, for a couple of reasons. First, everyone looks to us, even when they criticize us. One thing I learned in my career was people want U.S. leadership, even when they don't want it. And yet, we're not, at the moment, really postured to do that. And I don't want to get overly political, but the truth of it is our current administration has pulled out of just about every multilateral institution that could be a foundation for global leadership. And has signaled, with the America First policy, that that's not what we're doing. I know they will say that we are leading. And I've heard them speak publicly, at the Munich Security Conference and elsewhere, about how, \"The United States is leading.\" But if you're in the audience and listening to people, no one thinks we're leading. So you have that problem. And then if we're not going to lead, who does? I don't think the Chinese can lead. They do not have our soft power, meaning the universal identification with culture and values that people have when they look to the United States. I mean, 70% of the box office receipts for American movies are overseas, mostly in Russia and China. And no other country has that, that soft power. So while people may want medical supplies from China, and they are presently the world's largest manufacturer and supplier of ventilators and masks, and while they're also shipping out medical equipment to dozens of countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the United States, I think people will gladly take their help, but not translate that into a desire for Chinese leadership on international affairs, global order, national security. And so I fear that we're in that World War I posture where no one is picking up the leadership mantle in a real sense. It's hard work. It's really hard work. And nations are going their own way. And on top of that-- I mean, I've always been kind of an embarrassingly enthusiastic fan of the European Union, largely because I was a student in Europe in the early days of that. And I became infected with the idea that this was kind of a solution to Europe's problems. Which I think, for the most part, it has been. But even in the European Union, you have disunity. Germany has done well, better than most of the countries there. But none of the countries are helping each other, and they're competing for all of the things you need to get through this. And the Chinese have shown up, again, with help that's accepted in places like Italy. Russia has shown up in Serbia, which is not a NATO member but is a partner nation of NATO. Russia has shown up to great effect with their Slavic allies in Serbia. So what you see is a situation, so far, that is more comparable to the post-World War I situation than the post-World War II situation. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay, John, let's maybe dig into some specific issues. And maybe the most important is what you think, what your sense is-- I know it's awfully early, but what your sense is of how this will affect the U.S.-China strategic rivalry. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Well, this is a difficult time for U.S.-China relations for a bunch of reasons. First you have the trade war, which has eased a bit with the Phase I Agreement. But the Phase I Agreement didn't cover the toughest issues, really. It didn't cover agreements on manufacturing, for example, which is the thing I think Trump really wanted out of it. So you have, still, the trade tensions. I mean, let's break it down. You've got that. You've got the military competition, which centers on the South China Sea, China Sea and Taiwan, potentially. And in the background of all of that, you have the approaching presidential election. Now, I've been around long enough to have listened to the China debate in every presidential election. And in every presidential election, China's one of the bad boys. So we're about to experience a lot of rhetoric, perhaps not from the Democratic side. In fact, I don't anticipate it from the Democratic side, even though it has been, often in the past, on the Democratic side. But I have a sense it may not be this year because of these unique circumstances. But the potential for a breakthrough in China-U.S. relations is not great at the moment. That's probably an understatement. Add to that the fact that Washington's debated this for years, and the way I see the foreign policy elite in Washington, whatever that means: to some it's \"The Swamp,\" to others it's \"The Elite,\" I guess. But really smart people, thinkers, people who work on foreign policy, both in the government and outside: The mood on China has really soured in the last couple of years, a sense that we have tried all of the things that we can try to encourage a better relationship with China, and nothing has quite worked. And so that's left, I think, more people than in the past thinking of China as much less than a partner, when in fact for years, the debate was, \"Will China be an enemy, an adversary, a competitor, potentially a partner?\" Right now, I think the \"partner\" vote is pretty small. MICHAEL MORELL: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Now, what do I think? I think-- I get to say what I think, right? I think we ought to be trying to figure out how to get closer to competitor / partner here. Because given the fact that these are the two most important, largest economies in the world, we're not just doing this for ourselves. It's going to affect everyone in the world, what happens in the China-U.S. relationship. So we actually are carrying a responsibility for a good part of the world when we deal with China. And I think a trade war is a bad idea, even though I think Trump is correct to have spotted abuses in their trade program. That's fair enough. But to make it a war is a bad thing. To have pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership gave up leverage that we would have had in Asia to deal with China on a more effective foundation. Because with the, I guess, total of 11 other countries from Pacific to Asia, we would have had a foundation of accord on broad trade issues with which to face China. Versus the situation we have now where we're facing them bilaterally and the remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have coalesced and gone their own way in an agreement that leaves us out. So what you've got to do, then, to get a better strategic relationship is get back into that kind of club where you're dealing with all of these people together. It would have the advantage of traditional alliances, like NATO, the European Union relationship, the former partners in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. If we were all knitted up with them, then we would be able to represent those interests combined in our dealing with China, rather than where we are now. So I don't want to leave the sense that this is all hopeless. This is all fixable, repairable. But it's hard work, and those things, I think, have to be done with no illusions. Because China is certainly not going to be an easy counterpart for us to deal with. They are a rising power. They are looking to the future. They think their day has come. And yet they have their own internal problems. And I'll stop there because that's the other side of this coin: They're having their own internal problems. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. It really seems to me, and I don't know if I'm overstating this, but it seems to me that they sense that this is an opportunity for them to garner some significant influence around the world, right? With us focused internally, and with their ability to share medical supplies and medical personnel, that they see this as a soft-power opportunity. And I'm wondering how you think about that? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: It certainly is an opportunity. It is an opportunity to gain soft power, or to present a different face that leaves that residue of soft power with other countries. I am skeptical that they can bring it off, in part because I just don't have a sense that people identify with everything from their human rights practices to their governmental structure. They'd like to present what they are doing governmentally as an alternative model. Call it \"Market Leninism,\" whatever you want to call it: basically a fairly open economy and a very restricted, tight-political-control regime. I don't think anyone really wants that. But I could be wrong. I mean, we may be at one of those-- that's how I would bet. I would bet that people will have a transactional relationship with China, be very happy about that. But the only reason they would lean toward China and allow China to exploit this for soft power advantage and leadership advantage-- the only reason, in my judgment, is because we are creating a vacuum. In other words, we are creating a void there that they can move into. We are part of the opportunity. And I think-- MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, one of the-- JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: --we -- MICHAEL MORELL: --one of the th-- JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: --the old, people would run to us. Everyone that I talk to in Asia, and I'll bet you've had this experience, too: They want us in the game in Asia. They're in China's orbit economically, but they don't want to be in it politically. That's where I see it. MICHAEL MORELL: John, the other primary adversaries of the U.S.-- Russia, Iran, North Korea: One of the questions that I get and I'd love to pose it to you is, \"Do you have any concerns about any of them trying to take advantage of the current situation?\" JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. Yes. Iran-- I'm sure they all consider us not only distracted, but militarily less adroit right now than we normally would be because of the fact that our military has to be concerned about this virus. So we're seeing, I think, in Iraq there has been no letup in the attacks on American interests and forces by Iran's proxies, the militia and so forth. The Russians have been behaving mischievously with things like buzzing our aircraft and ships, vessels, in both the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Chinese have been very provocative recently in the South China Sea. And the North Koreans have been on a missile-shooting spree. So add all of that up, I think you're definitely seeing a time when these countries see an opening to do things that we would normally combat instantly, both rhetorically publicly and perhaps militarily, when we're off-balance. We're not being able to do much of that. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. The one I worry the most about, John, is Iran because they both need an external enemy, an external focus, to get their public's mind off of their public's dissatisfaction with them, and I think they sense that maybe this is an opportunity for us to look at Iraq and say, \"It's just not worth it, it's just not worth fighting for.\" So I do really worry about Iran picking up the tempo even more in Iraq, with the hope that we just say, \"We're going to go home; it's not worth it.\" JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: I think that's a valid fear. I agree with you. We haven't mentioned Syria, either, where, in this current circumstance, we were already at the point of saying, \"It's not worth it to us.\" But it's hard for me to imagine us remaining very committed there in these circumstances. And also places like this, it ripples into other things. For example, the great controversy now over the World Health Organization: You could do a whole podcast on that itself. But what they're facing reminds me of the kind of situations that you and I often dealt with in our former jobs. Where you look at something and you realize, \"The alternatives facing us: None of them are good. Which one is least bad?\" I think the World Health Organization is not without its faults and flaws. But when you look at a situation like Syria, for example, they're kind of stuck. If they don't intervene in parts of the world where we can't really be present, whether it's Syria or sub-Saharan Africa, those countries are not going to get much help as this virus takes hold. And yet they end up having to deal with nasty characters, dictators, and open themselves up to criticism for doing that. So which do we want? Do we want them not to do that? Do we want them to do that? Those are unpalatable alternatives. But this virus is confronting people with those kinds of choices. MICHAEL MORELL: So another question I wanted to ask you is about international terrorists. You know, we both know that Al Qaeda, prior to 9/11, was researching chemical and biological weapons, anthrax on the biological weapons side. We know that ISIS was interested in both chemical and biological weapons, and actually used chemical weapons on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria, chemical weapons they had produced in university labs where those universities were inside the caliphate. So I'm just wondering about [whether] this might rekindle an interest of terrorists in biological weapons. What's your sense? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: You know, that's a really tough one, Michael. The surprising thing to me all along with terrorism is why we haven't seen them use biological weapons more than they have. Because we've known for years that they're not that hard to make, leave aside coronavirus. It's been demonstrated that you can make pretty sophisticated chemical and biological tools with household chemicals and fairly easily available strains, cultures. So I'm puzzled as to why they haven't done it before. I could see-- I almost hate to say it because sometimes you think up an idea, and you think it's so horrible you don't want to suggest it. But I could see the extreme elements of the organizations seeing merit in getting someone infected and circulating him in society somehow as a kind of living weapon that can't be detected very easily. But on the other hand, it's also occurred to me-- this is why this question's so hard: If you're in ISIS right now, you're probably on the run, hiding out in remote parts of Iraq and Syria. You're probably getting this virus, or you're susceptible to it. And it could just as easily destroy their fighting population as it destroys everything else. And hard to believe that they have much in the way of medical equipment, testing, medicines, and so forth. So I think that's a really hard one. I can't really offer any great wisdom on that one. MICHAEL MORELL: Let me just come to the last question, John, come back to this issue of China's pursuit of influence. One of my concerns is the financial stability of emerging markets. They are heavily leveraged. They have a lot of dollar-denominated debt. They're not going to be, from a public health perspective, able to deal with the outbreak. They're not going to have the fiscal and monetary policy tools to make a difference on the economic side. So I wouldn't be surprised if a number of them start lining up outside the IMF and the World Bank asking for help. And my fear is that there are going to be so many of them that they're not going to be able to get what they need from those institutions. And there's only one place in the world who has that kind of money. And so I'm concerned that China kind of swoops in to save the day here for many of these emerging markets. And the potential impact of that on Chinese influence may be much, much more significant than it is on the public health side. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: I think that's exactly what going to happen. The projections I've seen for emerging markets have their growth rates plummeting by at least five percent just this year. And Lord knows what happens after that. So they're-- MICHAEL MORELL: And we knew how difficult it was to deal with one country in financial crisis, or two or three in financial crisis, let alone ten or 15. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Right. And a number of these countries-- yes, so, yes, they're ripe for the picking, and China will show up, I'm sure. Again, the only way I think China begins to translate this into real influence is if they stop being so transactional in the way they provide assistance. Usually, what they're doing is providing assistance with all kinds of qualifiers. Not moral and human rights qualifiers, but qualifiers that give them territorial rights, commercial rights, and so forth. And so there's a kind of exploitative quality to their assistance. That doesn't mean people wouldn't take it. But it does, again, in my mind, limit how much love they buy for it. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Maybe it's not so much about love, though, in the end. And then at the end, you've also got to look at how-- one thing we haven't talked about, and very quickly I would just observe, the other part of the economy that's really in a tailspin as a result of this little, tiny, microscopic virus is the oil market. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Because everyone's production is down, demand is down. Russia and China had a brief battle over reducing oil output. Russia won. The projections I've seen have oil prices plummeting in April and May below where they are now. Which is around, what, $40-some a barrel. And so that is going to hit some of these emerging markets: Nigeria, Angola. It's going to hit Russia itself. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: And that's another almost-incalculable factor in all of this. But, again, if China's recovering, they'll be one of the few people buying oil. And so that's another bit of leverage they have perhaps. MICHAEL MORELL: John, thank you-- JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: The other thing with China is we keep our eye on it. I've said where I stand, but I'm also quite prepared to say I could be wrong because we're going to see some discontinuity out of this that none of us are predicting. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. John, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us today. Thank you. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: It's always a pleasure, Michael, thank you. * * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - ROBERT WORTH INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT WORTH PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON \tMICHAEL MORELL: Robert, thanks for joining us. It's great to have you on Intelligence Matters. \tROBERT WORTH: It's a pleasure to be here. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Robert, as you know, I read your piece in The New York Times Sunday magazine, I think it was January 9th, on Mohammed bin Zayed who we all affectionately call MBZ, and we can do that throughout this piece. And I read it with great interest. I've known MBZ for many years and I think this is the first profile that I've ever seen of him, number one, and number two, I think you did a terrific job capturing him. So I wanted to have you on the podcast to talk about him because I think he is an important and an extraordinary person. So maybe the place to start is to ask you why you wrote the piece in the first place. Why'd you want to do this? \tROBERT WORTH: Well, I had heard a lot about MBZ over the years. He's someone who is very well known to policy makers, as you know. He keeps a low profile, though. So ordinary people really haven't heard much about him. I think part of that is because he's not the official ruler of the UAE. His brother remains the titular president. But he's really been exercising the levers of power there for many years. And he's a sophisticated thinker. I mean, that's one of the first things that people will tell you who knew him well. You know, former heads of state and so forth who often to go to see him and seek his advice. Military leaders, a number of them had told me, including General Mattis, I hope he doesn't mind me saying that, know him well and respect his judgement. And then secondly, I wrote a book about the Arab Spring and its consequences. And I was very interested in the role of the UAE, specifically MBZ who guided those efforts in what happened there. He and, let's say the Emirates and the Saudis, are often portrayed as the bad guys of the Arab Spring, as the, sort of, autocrats who snuffed out of the hopes of Arab Democrats. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. Right. \tROBERT WORTH: And I had a feeling it was much more complicated and I wanted to get a better understanding of how they saw all of those events. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. Well, I was one of those government officials who found him and still find him to be a very sophisticated thinker and someone who I always found great value in sitting down with and having a conversation about almost anything. So I'm not surprised you heard that from many people. Why do you think they decided to cooperate with you? Because they've been so reluctant to let him talk to a journalist, for example, and you had the opportunity to interview him. Why do you think they did that? \tROBERT WORTH: I think it's a couple reasons. I think, one, they were independently, I think, moving closer towards being a little more transparent. He's made more head of state visits to places. He's, sort of, come out a bit as being the decision maker in the Emirates. And also I had lobbied them over some time and I think the fact that I had written quite a bit about the Gulf over many years may have made a difference. And then finally, I wrote a story that came out in in 2018 about a big ransom, a group of Qataris who were falcon hunting in Iraq and were captured. And then there was an enormous and complicated ransom. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Captured by? \tROBERT WORTH: Captured by a Shiite militia. Iran played a big role in all of this. And I wrote a long story about how that happened, which, to be pretty frank about it, made Qatar look bad. Now as you know, the Emirates is in a big, big feud with Qatar. And I think that may inadvertently have endeared me to the Emirati leadership. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So I think it was, Robert, one of the first two paragraphs of your piece that you called MBZ one of the most powerful men on Earth. That's a quote. Why? \tROBERT WORTH: Well, if you just look at the moment, you know, the sovereign wealth funds of the Emirates, they're tremendous. More than 1.3 trillion. He's also developed a small, but very sophisticated and efficient military. Really, as far as I understand, probably the best trained special forces apart from Israel in the Middle East. \tMICHAEL MORELL: I think that's right. Yeah. \tROBERT WORTH: And he's deployed them. So he has the levers of power in several different ways, and also because unlike some other countries, he really, along with his brothers, is in charge, can make independent decisions without having to worry too much about domestic audience, since it's a very small country. So for all those reasons, I think he just, sort of, stands out. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Okay. So for our listeners, let me ask you some questions about him personally. Who is he from a family pedigree perspective? \tROBERT WORTH: Sure. He is the son of the founder of the United Arab Emirates. The country was founded in 1971. And his father, Sheikh Zayed al Nahyan, is just a legendary, huge figure. Really, I think universally respected in the Middle East because no one thought that country would really come together. It was a group of sheikhdoms on the north side of the Arabian coast, of Arabian peninsula. And they were fractious and there was a history of fighting even within some of those sheikhdoms, including Abu Dhabi, which is the largest, and that's the one MBZ comes from. But Sheikh Zayed was a very charismatic, very wise character who managed to pull them all together. And then, of course, used the tremendous oil money they had wisely and they built this incredible example of a peaceful and very developed country. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And then you said his brother is actually the leader. And he's got a couple roles. Right? He's the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and he's also the defense minister of the entire country. So how is it that he essentially becomes the leader of the whole place? \tROBERT WORTH: Well, his brother Sheikh Khalifa had a stroke years back and so was really out of commission. The titles that they have, the leaders of the different Emirates, are a little out of whack with their actual responsibilities. So for instance, many people are more familiar with Sheikh Mohammed who's the ruler of Dubai, one of the other seven Emirates. But Abu Dhabi has always been by far the richest and just in geography, it's by far the largest of the Emirates. And so that automatically gave its leader a greater share of power. And then finally, I think there's a kind of complex internal process in which people are sifted out. And it's not exactly democracy, but there's a kind of collective judgement on who is most fit to run the place. And I think for a number of years, it's been clear both to outsiders and inside the Emirates that Sheikh Mohammed was the guy. \tMICHAEL MORELL: A little bit about his background, where he went to school, jobs he had in the runup to his current roles? \tROBERT WORTH: Sure. So when he was fairly young, when he was a teenager, his father sent him to Morocco where he lived and studied and even worked briefly in a restaurant. I think his father wanted to move him away from a place where he was seen as this, sort of, (UNINTEL). You know, the heir apparent or one of the heirs apparent and to toughen him up a bit and I think that worked. He lived a pretty simple life. He studied there. He later went to a famously tough boarding school in England where Prince Charles and other royals had gone. And then he went to Sandhurst, the British military academy. And then he returned to the UAE where he followed a military path. Learned how to fly, was an officer, progressed through the ranks, and eventually became the leader of the UAE's military. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So how would you describe him as a person? You spent some time with him. How would you describe him? \tROBERT WORTH: Yeah. You know, I've met a number of heads of state. And what's interesting is that when you sit down with him, you don't see that sense, sort of, how to put it, PR antenna that you see with a lot of heads of state who are, sort of, conscious always of how they sound and looking around. They're seeing who the audience is and so forth. He sits down, looks at you. You have this sense of a private conversation. He's very deliberate, soft spoken, analytical. There's something a little bit almost professorial about him. He's charming, too. He's funny. I mean, I think I mentioned in the story, his accent is maybe slightly British, but his vocabulary is definitely American. You know, he'll say things like, \"Come on, guys. Let's do this. Let's not do this. Whatever.\" So and he loves to surprise people. He clearly has a sense of humor about that. Sort of, playing off the image of the ruler. He loves to be informal. Take you out for a walk to show up in the helicopter that he's flying instead of someone else. \tMICHAEL MORELL: There's a humility about him, too. Right? \tROBERT WORTH: There is. Yeah. Yeah. Compared with some Arab rulers, potentate (?) sheikhs, whatever that you come across, he doesn't present himself that way. And I suppose that may be partly character and partly a legacy of his father who was famously humble in the way that he approached people. It's also partly by calculation. I mean, people revere that quality in him. \tMICHAEL MORELL: I wonder if his time in Morocco instilled some of that in him as well. \tROBERT WORTH: I don't know. Yeah. It's possible. And again, I think that's part of the legacy of his father. He was very conscious, I think, early on of the danger of the oil money making a generation of spoiled brats who hadn't earned anything on their own. And I think his father wanted to prevent that from happening to him. \tMICHAEL MORELL: You talk about surprises and informality. The first time that I went to the Emirates after I retired, he asked to see and a car was sent to pick me up and I was taken to a small restaurant. And I had no idea where I was going, but this small restaurant where he was doing his meetings that day. Not in some palace, but in a restaurant. So he is absolutely what you said he was. How did you find him as an interview subject? \tROBERT WORTH: Well, I should say I only spent an hour with him. I first met him with one of the surprises. I was attending an iftar during Ramadan, an evening breaking of the fast meal. And he just, to my complete surprise, walked up behind me and, sort of, tapped me on the shoulder and brought me in and sat me down next to him. So we spoke a little bit then. During the interview, I mean, he was a great subject. He answered my questions and then he went off sometimes in slight digressions, which ended up being tremendously helpful for me because they were full of rich anecdote. And he didn't hold back. You know, he said some things that maybe he didn't want to be ultimately quoted on. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So how would you, Robert, describe his world view, his mindset, his vision? This is the heart of your piece, right? \tROBERT WORTH: Sure. Yeah. I think you could compare him a little bit to Lee Kuan Yew. He wants to further develop the country, which after all, was initially developed by his father. And he wants to, I think, make Emiratis more disciplined. Education is immensely important. Probably the most important thing to him. He wants to extend that. That's what he's worked so hard with NYU and other educational institutions he's brought there. And I think his vision of the Emirates and the Arab world's future is-- well, first of all, it's not democratic. We should say that right out. Although, it does have its own, sort of, how to put it, certain forms of accountability in which people can bring concerns to the ruling family. And I don't think he would use this word, but I think, at least in relative terms in the Arab world, it's a secular vision. He does not want to see political Islam taking over that region. And I think he's immensely, immensely concerned about that. He's seen what's happened in the past few decades, what happened starting in Iran with the Islamic revolution there, what happened with successive waves in the Sunni Arab world, what happened in Saudi Arabia, which is right next door and was a huge concern for him. He did not want to see that kind of Wahhabi extremism take over. And he's worked very hard to stop it. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Has this vision been a constant for him for a long period of time or has he grown into this, do you think? \tROBERT WORTH: I think he's grown to it. And after all, I should say he was an Islamist in his thinking as a young man. So many people in this generation were. It was partly because his own father unwittingly had put a guy in charge of his son's education who was, himself, a Muslim Brotherhood member, an Egyptian living in the Emirates, and he was under the sway of that thinking for several years and then he, at some point, decided in the early '80s that it was completely irreconcilable with the kind of the country he was growing up in and with the kind of ruling system it had. And so I think over time, as he saw how powerful the Islamist thought was in the region, he began to develop a stronger desire to push back against it. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So you tell a story in the piece about a conversation that he had with his father right after 9/11. Can you tell that story? \tROBERT WORTH: Sure. This is when he went to his father and said-- this must have been, I guess, October 2011. He said, \"The Americans are going into Afghanistan.\" And his father, Sheikh Zayed, was quite an old man, said, \"Well, we have to be there with them. We need to be fighting alongside them.\" And MBZ wasn't quite prepared for this. And he said, \"Well, how I do sell this? I mean, after all, this would mean Muslims killing Muslims, which is going to look bad.\" And his father then said, \"So tell me. Do you like the Quran? The Hadith? You know, the son of the prophet?\" And of course MBZ, \"Yes, of course.\" And he said, \"Do you think that this guy out there, Osama bin Laden, in the mountains is living according to our religion?\" And MBZ said, \"No. Absolutely not.\" And he said, \"You're right. Our religion is being hijacked.\" \tMICHAEL MORELL: And he ultimately takes on that view. Correct? \tROBERT WORTH: Yes. Yes. Yes. And he told me that that really stuck with him. \tMICHAEL MORELL: You mentioned, kind of, Lee Kuan Yew of the Middle East. Do you think he thinks about it that way? Does he have a role model in his mind? \tROBERT WORTH: I don't think so. He certainly never mentioned Lee Kuan Yew. That was my thought. I think, actually, Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai, who, after all, got more attention earlier, I think, for the way that he developed Dubai and did this very flashy both tourist and economic-- \tMICHAEL MORELL: -- Kind of Disneyland feel to it. \tROBERT WORTH: Disney. Exactly. Kind of a crazy Disneyland. And I think he has mentioned, Lee Kuan Yew, as a kind of role model. I think for MBZ, it's less about being an economic hub. After all, Abu Dhabi is really more the capital. It's more involved in political and financial military decisions. But I think he does want to build a place that is where more or less secular values are being promoted, where he wants to build a future beyond oil, and he's worked very hard on that. That's one of the things that doesn't get talked about much, but he created this alternative sovereign wealth fund Mubadala that has worked very hard at creating alternatives to oil. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So Robert, he's deeply concerned about political Islam. And I think he would argue that more open democracies in the Middle East are more vulnerable to it and you need a more authoritarian state to take it on, and that's that convenient argument for him. Right? But do you think at the end of the day-- you know the region well. Do you think that argument is right? \tROBERT WORTH: That's a very tough question. And I think it really depends on the particular country. When I look at the countries in the Middle East today, I take great hope in looking at Tunisia, which, as you know, is a democracy now. It's still troubled. It's still got a very weak economy. But you do have a balance there between the relatively moderate liberal Islamist party and the principle secular party. But I think that's because Tunisia was in a very different condition from just about every other country in the region. For the rest of them, unfortunately, the nominally democratic republics that emerged after the second World War have just been catastrophic. And we saw what happened. I was living in Iraq after the American invasion when this rapid introduction of American style elections really seemed to make the country more unstable and violent and helped to propel it into a civil war. So I think that for a lot of those countries, some sort of benign autocracy may be the best way towards a more democratic future. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So I want to ask you, Robert, about his views of his relationships with the other players in the region. And maybe the place to start is us, the United States. How does he think about us? And I'll start by saying I've gotten earfuls over the years about U.S. policy. So I'll put that on the table. \tROBERT WORTH: Sure. Yeah. I can imagine. Well, I mean, first of all, the first thing to say is that there's a deep relationship. His father was very much in favor of a strong relationship with the United States and towards the west in general, you know, at a time when-- and remember Zayed founded the country in 1971, when anti-imperialism was running very strong. Arab nationalism was very strong. There were countries that were nationalizing their oil. And Zayed's attitude was, \"No. These people have the skills and the education and the wherewithal to help us and we need to be friends with them.\" And so MBZ, when he was growing up, absorbed that point of view, worked very closely as a military officer and later as the defense minister working with the Pentagon. But I think he was also anxious about what came to be called the democracy agenda. He felt that the United States should continue to value stability more in the region and that promoting elections often meant being blind to the circumstances of those countries. I mean, he saw what happened in Hamas with the elections there in 2006. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. \tROBERT WORTH: I think they were very anxious about the American invasion of Iraq in the first place. I think they would have probably preferred to have, if it were necessary in the first place to invade, to simply decapitate the regime and put a more palatable figure in charge, but not to change the system. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. What about the Saudis? And you mentioned a little bit of concern about Wahhabism and the spread of it. But his relationship with Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. How does he think about that? \tROBERT WORTH: You know, I think Saudi Arabia was maybe in some ways the biggest foreign concern for MBZ for many years just because it was right next door. It was so powerful, so rich. And I think the feeling, sort of, was, \"We have to help the Saudis help themselves,\" because the leadership there was feckless. He would never say that, of course. I think when he saw MBS come along, and he had actually even under late in the reign of King Abdullah, there had been a recognition and a feeling that they could work together. So it started then. But when he saw MBS, he thought, \"Okay. This is a young guy who's got bold ideas for reform,\" which were patterned, I think, in large measure on the UAE and what MBZ had done. And he said, \"You know, this guy may be young, impetuous. He may have made mistakes, but he's headed in the right direction. We really need to encourage him.\" And he told his American counterparts, \"You guys should get on board.\" I don't think he believed that the United States would be able to make that decision about who would be the next ruler. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. \tROBERT WORTH: You know, that's a decision that's made in Saudi Arabia. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. \tROBERT WORTH: But what he did say was, \"Please get to know this guy.\" \tMICHAEL MORELL: So he actually has mentored MBS a bit? \tROBERT WORTH: Yes, he has. I think the trouble there is that nobody wants to admit that for various reasons. The Saudis see themselves as the big gorilla in the region. \tMICHAEL MORELL: The big boys on the block. Yep. \tROBERT WORTH: Right? They're in charge. Right? And even though MBZ is older than MBS, if there's a mentoring relationship, they don't want to present it that way. And the Emirates, for the same reason, doesn't want to get out of line. They're keen to present themselves as an assisting partner. \tMICHAEL MORELL: But it would certainly, I would say, be in our interest for him to be mentoring MBS. That would be actually a good thing. \tROBERT WORTH: Exactly. Well, I certainly heard a lot of talk about that, especially after the gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi, who I knew personally. And I think there was a feeling of, \"Who is going to do it? Who is going to coach this guy? Who is going to--\" I mean, I've called-- \tMICHAEL MORELL: Who's going to tell him, \"You can't do this,\" sort of thing? \tROBERT WORTH: Exactly. Right. I mean, if we can't get rid of him and replace him with someone else, which, after all, is a very perilous enterprise and probably beyond our powers, who is going to help him change? And a lot of people would say, \"Well, the only person in a position to do that is MBZ.\" I'm not sure MBZ is in the position to do that, though, because especially now that MBS has been in place for a number of years, he sees himself as the main guy. \tMICHAEL MORELL: The Iranians. How does he think about the Iranians? \tROBERT WORTH: I think as we said earlier, that Iran since '79 has been a tremendous concern for the Emiratis, a feeling that right next door, they have this radical revolutionary power. And there were times, well, for many years, I should say, they would encourage, I think somewhat irresponsibly, they would encourage the United States to be more aggressive with Iran without really adequately recognizing or understanding how dangerous that would be for them. After all, they're the first line of defense. They're right across (UNINTEL). You can practically see Iran from the UAE coastline. And I think they've recently become more realistic about that not just because of Trump. And after all, under Obama, they felt that Obama was, kind of, throwing them out to the winds and, sort of, leaving them to Iran's mercies. But then they've seen that Trump, who they initially welcomed as someone who was going to be a tougher opponent of Iran, is actually very unpredictable. You know, that he's made these gestures. He assassinated Qasem Soleimani. And other times, he seems to be saying, \"Sort it out yourselves. I want to pull my forces out of this region. It's not my problem.\" And so they have now undertaken, and I think they pioneered this and the Saudis followed, a sort of quiet diplomacy with Iran in an effort to make sure that at least they are not targeted if there's a war. I mean, that may be impossible. I think and I hope they recognize that's impossible. You know, the notion that you can cut yourself out of a war is unrealistic. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Particularly when you have a U.S. military base sitting there. \tROBERT WORTH: Exactly. Exactly. It's not going to work. \tMICHAEL MORELL: How do you think he sees Russian and Chinese attempts to gain some influence in the region? \tROBERT WORTH: I think he sees Russia and China as important powers that he needs. He needs to balance his relationship with the United States with these guys. He sees that Russia, for years now, has worked hard to play a powerful role in Syria and elsewhere. Russia's really all over the place in the region. It wants to be a power broker. And I think with Russia, my sense is that his principle goal is to pull Russia away from Iran. But I think he also figures than he needs to be working with them if they're involved in the region. With China, it's just a fact of their tremendous economic power in Africa, to a less extent, in the Middle East. If he doesn't get what he wants from American military suppliers, he's long been perfectly willing to deal with the Chinese. And he sees the Belt and Road Initiative as something he's got to be part of. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. You know, my sense a little bit is that his view of the Obama administration not being there for him and the Trump administration's unpredictability, he has no choice but to hedge a bit, right, and talk to the Russians and talk to the Chinese and be more engaged with them. It's just reality for him. It's real politique for him. \tROBERT WORTH: Yeah. Absolutely. I think he's right about that. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So Robert, MBZ made a decision in 2009, around 2009 to pursue a more activist foreign policy. Why did he do that? What were the drivers? \tROBERT WORTH: I think what really began to move him in that direction-- I mean, he had developed a much stronger military. He saw the United States, first of all, playing a less active role in the region. He thought he couldn't rely on them anymore. And then when the Arab Spring happened, I think he was very anxious about political Islamists taking advantage of that vacuum. And he didn't think anyone else was going to play that role. There was an important meeting. I don't think I mentioned this in the story. But a meeting of the friends of Syria group I think in Istanbul and around 2012, 2013 at which there was a discussion about the Syrian rebels and who to back. And the foreign minister, MBZ's brother Abdullah bin Zayed, said, \"Look, we're getting concerned. A lot of these rebels are very, very Islamist. You know, we're going to end up repeating what happened in Afghanistan here.\" And the Turkish and Qatari foreign minister said, \"No. No. No. No. No. We can't worry about that. These guys are the best fighters. We've just got to back them and then when it's all done, when Asaad's out, we'll figure out the rest.\" And Abdullah bin Zayed, ABZ as he's known, was horrified, but also horrified that John Kerry, who was there and listening to this, did not step in. Did not say anything. And that moment was later described to me by MBZ and others as an important moment when they realized, \"Wait a minute. Something's going on here. No one is recognizing how dangerous this is.\" \tMICHAEL MORELL: What are some of the examples of the more activist foreign policy that they've pursued? \tROBERT WORTH: Well, first of all, they were very much involved, I think, in what happened in Egypt in 2013 when Mohamed Morsi, the Democratic elected president, was overthrown and replaced by the military and now we have Sisi who, in many ways, has been a pretty disastrous figure. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Not a bastion of dem-- he's not Thomas Jefferson. \tROBERT WORTH: That's putting it very mild. Yes. And in many ways, has been more repressive than Mubarak was. Of course, MBZ would make the argument and it's impossible to know. What if Morsi had stayed on and had led a thorough Islamization of the state? After all, demographically and otherwise, Egypt is the anchor of the Arab world. That could potentially have been catastrophic. And that's the argument they will make. So that was, I think, the first, and in many ways, the most important intervention MBZ was involved in. Then there was Libya where they had been involved along with NATO in 2011, but then as Libya collapsed and starting in 2013, they got more and more worried. And they eventually backed Khalifa Haftar who was a big enemy of Islamists of all stripes. And they have given all kinds of military support to him and continue to do so. And many people have criticized him heavily for that, because after all, Libya just seems to get worse and worse with the Turks backing the other side. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. And Russians there now. \tROBERT WORTH: The Russians are there. Many foreign powers. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. \tROBERT WORTH: And then, of course, the other big place where he's been involved is Yemen, where he joined the Saudi intervention, the war in Yemen starting in 2015, which has been a catastrophe for that country. I think the Emiratis recognized much, much earlier than the Saudis that this was a very bad situation and they pulled out. But it took them a little too long to do that. They've also been involved in the Horn of Africa. The Emirates has backed militias in Somalia. And there again I think much of this has gone badly. They ended up in a kind of proxy war with Qatar, which almost everywhere backs the Islamist militias. But I should say the Emirates also played a very good diplomatic role in the (UNINTEL) between Ethiopia and (UNINTEL). So not all of their interventions are military and not all of them end up badly. \tMICHAEL MORELL: How do you think he assesses how this more activist foreign policy has gone? \tROBERT WORTH: I think he probably sees Yemen as, if not a mistake, then something that went badly. They did try. The Emiratis tried very hard to create a political solution there. They tried to work with (UNINTEL) who was aligned with the Houthis in Yemen and they tried to end that war. They failed for complicated reasons. It's a very messy, messy place. I think MBZ would defend it and say that what's happening now may look bad, but that's weighed against a what-if, weighed against the potential Islamization of these countries, which could, it's true, have been catastrophic. I mean, Libya, for instance, enormous supplies of weaponry and in an important place on the Mediterranean coast could have been really dangerous if it had become a theocracy. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So he has this fear, right, of a dark future for the Middle East, which is leading him to behave the way he does both at home in trying to build a modern society, almost liberal modern society, and the way he behaves from a foreign policy perspective in the region. Do you think he's ultimately optimistic about the future of the region or not? \tROBERT WORTH: I think he is. I think he believes he's going to win. But I think he believes he has to fight hard in order to do so. And some people would say that he's fighting too hard. I mean, for instance, you mentioned he's building a liberal society at home. Well, in certain respects, yes. He's empowered women. He's very much about pluralism. You go to the Emirates and you see things you don't see in Saudi. You see Hindu temples. You see Christian churches. All that kind of thing. But in terms of civil liberties, no way. I mean, that is a surveillance state where you really better not criticize not just the Brotherhood, but express any serious disagreement with the government. Everyone is being watched and there's just quite a bit of fear about that in the population. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So as a writer, I'm sure that some things were left on the cutting room floor in your piece. Was there anything that was taken out that you really wish would have made the cut? \tROBERT WORTH: Well, one thing that I find interesting is the way that the embargo with Qatar developed. You know, it's a longstanding thing. It has personal elements, but I think the most important part is this deep disagreement about the role of political Islam. And so in 2013 and 2014, there were meetings between the Qatari Emir and the leaders of the other Gulf powers where very, very tough confrontational meetings. One of them in particular that I got accounts of that I had to take out, in 2014 in which the young, new emir of Qatar was essentially surrounded in a hostile meeting in Riyadh and King Abdullah, kind of, read him the riot act and said, \"You're a liar. You've got to sign this paper in which you pledge to change all of your policies,\" and he wouldn't do it. And it came to a sort of standstill and then finally, MBZ, sort of, whispered to the king and then took the emir of Qatar aside and talked to him for 15 minutes in full view of everybody else in the room and managed to persuade him to sign this document. That's just one example of the intense rivalries within the Gulf that went on that maybe it was a little bit too inside for the American leaders. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. It's a great story. Robert, thank you so much for joining us. To the listeners, you can Google \"Robert Worth New York Times\" and you'll find a list of all the things that Robert has written including this piece and I would urge everybody to go read it. Robert, thank you. \tROBERT WORTH: It's a pleasure. Thank you. \t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "President Trump floated appointing Sidney Powell, the attorney his legal team disavowed after she promoted conspiracy theories about the election, as special counsel to investigate voter fraud, according to two advisers to Mr. Trump. Her name was suggested during a meeting in the White House. The news of Powell's possible appointment was first reported by The New York Times.\u00a0 A senior campaign official told CBS News they personally like Powell's \"hardcore nationalism,\" but said that is a minority opinion within the campaign. The person added that \"establishment types\" within the campaign are increasingly wary of Powell's influence on the president and his agenda. One adviser to Mr. Trump called Powell \"a disastrous mistake.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump tweeted on November 14 that Powell was part of his \"truly great team\" filing legal challenges to challenge the election results. Trump campaign attorney Rudy Giuliani also identified her as a member of the legal team, and she appeared with him at a press conference to discuss the campaign's unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud. Powell promoted a number of baseless conspiracy theories about the election, including that the deceased Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, among others, had rigged the election against Mr. Trump by programming voting machines to switch votes for the president to President-elect Joe Biden. Powell's claims were viewed as far fetched even by typical allies of the president. Fox News host Tucker Carlson said she refused to provide him with any evidence of her claims about vote switching. \"When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her,\" Carlson said. \"When we checked with others around the Trump campaign, people in positions of authority, they also told us Powell had never given them any evidence to prove anything she claimed at the press conference.\" Mr. Trump's legal team sent a memo Saturday to dozens of staffers instructing them to preserve all documents related to Dominion Voting Systems \u2014 a voting software company used in 28 states specifically mentioned by Powell and Mr. Trump on numerous occasions \u2014 and Powell in anticipation of potential ligation by the company against the pro-Trump attorney.\u00a0 On November 23, Trump senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis said Powell was not a member of the Trump legal team, despite the earlier claims. Powell issued a press release after Ellis' announcement that she \"understands\" the press release, but she would \"continue to represent #WeThePeople who had their votes for Trump and other Republicans stolen by massive fraud through Dominion and Smartmatic, and we will be filing suit soon.\" She added the hashtag \"#KrakenOnSteriods.\"\u00a0 Powell has since filed lawsuits in several states challenging the election results. A federal judge on December 8 dismissed a lawsuit Powell filed in Georgia alleging widespread voter fraud and absentee ballot-related errors. Judges in Wisconsin and Arizona dismissed similar lawsuits brought by Powell a day later.\u00a0 \"Not only have Plaintiffs failed to provide the Court with factual support for their extraordinary claims, but they have wholly failed to establish that they have standing for the Court to consider them. Allegations that find favor in the public sphere of gossip and innuendo cannot be a substitute for earnest pleadings and procedure in federal court,\" U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa wrote in her decision. \"They most certainly cannot be the basis for upending Arizona's 2020 General Election.\" Powell and several associates have appealed their dismissed cases to the Supreme Court. They have also attempted to consolidate their challenges to the election results in Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona into one lawsuit, even though they failed to correctly file paperwork for the Wisconsin and Arizona appeals, and therefore did not get them docketed by the court. The Supreme Court previously declined to hear a case challenging the results of the election brought by the state of Texas. Caroline Linton and Kathryn Watson contributed reporting.

            "article_content": "Four students have reportedly been arrested in Hong Kong in the first police operation to enforce China's new \"national security\" law, officials said Wednesday. Arrests have been made previously under the new law for banners and slogans displayed at protests. \"Three males and one female, age 16-21, who claimed to be students, have been arrested for breaching the #nationalsecuritylaw. They were suspected of secession by advocating #HKindependence. Investigation is underway,\" the Hong Kong police tweeted. Prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong said that one of those arrested was Tony Chung, a student activist, and that he was detained after writing a Facebook post about \"#China's nationalism.\" \"Arrestee's mobile phones were hacked by unknown #Huawei and #Samsung phones soon after their arrests. Tonight's arrest will clearly send a chilling effect on #HK online speech,\" Wong tweeted. China's new \"national security\" legislation, which was written in secret in Beijing and came into force in Hong Kong on July 1, outlaws a variety of vaguely defined offenses like \"sedition\" that can carry sentences of life in prison. Critics accuse Beijing of using it to stifle the previously semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, with reports of people self-censoring and removing past social media posts for fear of prosecution. \"People are still fighting on the ground. They are still resisting, but they also feel a sense of terror,\" prominent Hong Kong politician and activist Nathan Law, who fled Hong Kong for the U.K. soon after the new \"national security\" law came into effect, told CBS News. Law became a household name in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory as a student leader during massive pro-democracy protests in 2014 and the emergent Nobel-peace-prize-nominated Umbrella Movement. He eventually founded the pro-democracy political party Demosisto, alongside Wong. The party was disbanded soon after the new \"national security\" legislation came into effect. \"When we realized the law was so draconian that we couldn't even speak up for Hong Kong, that it also indicts freedom of expression \u2014 really killing it \u2014 then for my consideration, I think we really did indeed need someone to be outside and to speak up for Hong Kong. So I decided to take that role,\" Law said. \"Leaving Hong Kong, you leave behind a lot of connections: Your family, your friends, the cat that you rescued on the street. But also it really gives you an opportunity to bear a huge responsibility to speak up for Hong Kong people,\" he said. The arrests come amid reports that upcoming elections for Hong Kong's legislative council, or LegCo, currently scheduled for September, could be postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. and Australia issued a joint statement on Tuesday reiterating their support for \"the people of Hong Kong to be able to elect Legislative Council representatives via a genuinely free and fair election, which is credible and peaceful, on September 6.\" \"Definitely Beijing wants to postpone the election because they're under pressure that a democratic candidate will perform very well,\" Law said, adding that no elected Hong Kong officials had been consulted about reported public health concerns. \"They're trying to postpone for a year, which is an extremely long period, and unjustifiable,\" he said. Law said he hopes that, from the relative safety of a country outside of China, he can build the necessary international pressure to help check Beijing's further encroachment on Hong Kong's freedoms. \"I think we need a value-bound community around the world that could act multi-laterally, assertively and collectively towards China ... We need to boost more allies like Europe, Japan and South Korea \u2014 these Asian democracies \u2014 to be in our camp in order to contain Beijing's authoritarian expansion,\" Law said. \"I think addressing the issues in Hong Kong is just a reflection of how to contain that authoritarian expansion, and Hong Kong is definitely a very symbolic place to enact those policies in order to hold China accountable,\" he said. Haley Ott is a digital reporter/producer for CBS News based in London.",

            "article_content": "Iowa Congressman Steve King is facing his toughest primary race in years on Tuesday, as Republicans who usually safeguard their incumbents have either shied away from defending him or backed his challengers. While King has\u00a0drawn headlines\u00a0for years for his\u00a0controversial comments,\u00a0the message from those hoping to unseat him has focused more on what King isn't able to do in Washington.\u00a0 In 2019, King was stripped of his House committee assignments after comments he made about white nationalism and white supremacy, which prompted a swift\u00a0bipartisan backlash. \"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\" King said in a New York Times\u00a0interview\u00a0in January 2019.\u00a0 Republican candidates and outside groups have honed in on King's waning influence. He has not only lost his committee assignments, but Republicans aren't even listening to his opinions, says Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Iowa Republican leader who has endorsed King's main primary opponent, Iowa state Senator Randy Feenstra.\u00a0 \"He can't even influence the committees because they're not accepting his voice,\" said Vander Plaats, who is president and CEO of the Family Leader, a Christian conservative group in Iowa. \"Just because you can scream conservative issues really, really loud in the middle of the street, the fact is, if nobody's listening to you, it doesn't make a difference anymore.\" King has chalked up his white nationalist comments in The New York Times to a misquote and \"weaponizing\" of the term. At a debate on Tuesday, he said the backlash and his removal were \"ginned up\" by the \"never-Trumpers.\"\u00a0 \"There's powers that be, some of them are money powers, not all of them, that want Steve King out of the way, because they don't want to have to do battle on life, on marriage and on budgets and on guns\u2026and on the border,\" King said. \u00a0 During that debate, King repeated a claim that House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy would advocate for King to regain his status and committee seats, which McCarthy promptly denied. \"Congressman King's comments cannot be exonerated, and I never said that,\" McCarthy said at a May press conference. He left the decision about his membership status to the Republican Steering Committee, but added, \"I think he'd get the same answer that he got before.\" As King seeks his tenth term in Washington, he's facing a major cash crunch compared to his opponents. According to the latest FEC filings, King currently has a little over $32,000 cash on hand compared to Feenstra's $126,000. King was outraised by his Democratic opponents in 2014 and 2018, but has never been outpaced by a Republican challenger this close to a primary. Feenstra's cash advantage has given him the ability to spend $266,300 on ads, according to Kantar/CMAG data, while King has not put up a television ad.\u00a0 Priorities for Iowa, a super PAC supporting Feenstra, has spent nearly $290,000 on\u00a0television ads, including one featuring Vander Plaats stressing that King is \"no longer effective.\" Another\u00a0ad\u00a0from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has put $200,000 into this race, says, \"It's been rough for Iowa farmers, and when we've needed him most, Steve King has let us down. He got kicked off the Agriculture Committee, hurting our farmers.\" Public and internal polls have shown Feenstra steadily closing the gap between him and King. A\u00a0poll in late April\u00a0showed Feenstra down by 7 points while the\u00a0latest poll, backed by the anti-King American Future Fund organization, had him ahead of King, 41% to 39%. There are two other candidates in the race and some Republicans noted that could split the vote enough among King's challengers to give him a win. One wrinkle in the primary this year is increased absentee voting. Iowa mailed absentee ballot requests to registered voters and nearly eight times as many Republicans in the district have returned absentee ballots as in the 2018 primary. Data obtained by CBS News also shows that a large number of Republicans requesting ballots in Iowa haven't voted in the past four primaries, which some people believe could benefit Feenstra. King has comfortably held the rural, conservative Iowan district since 2002, but in 2018 his seat was very much in play. First-time congressional candidate Democrat J.D. Scholten lost to King by just three points and Scholten is poised to be the Democrats' nominee again in 2020. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, meanwhile, won the district by 20 points that year.\u00a0 \"We lost two congressional seats in Iowa (in 2018), why would we put this seat at risk by renominating him?\" said David Kochel, a longtime Iowa Republican strategist who has contributed to Feenstra and helped Priorities for Iowa. \"We know that the Democrats want him to win the primary because it's the only way they've got a shot at this seat.\" Last Friday, President Trump tweeted endorsements for two other Iowa Republican Congressional candidates. Notably, King did not receive an endorsement from the president, something that the Feenstra campaign's\u00a0latest ad\u00a0seized upon.\u00a0 \"President Trump just doesn't trust Steve King, and it's hurting Iowa,\" the ad says.\u00a0 Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst have also stayed out of the primary. So has Reynolds, who told the\u00a0Sioux City Journal\u00a0editorial board in January 2019, \"I just hope he is doing some serious reflection on what is best for the people of the 4th District.\" Scott Reed, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's chief political strategist, said they got involved in the race to avoid King from hurting Senator Ernst's re-election campaign and becoming a \"real albatross around her neck.\" \"It could jeopardize the U.S. Senate if King is the nominee in the fall, and Joni Ernst has to fight for every single vote in rural Iowa. We can't afford to have this problem,\" he told CBS News. But King isn't without loyalists in the Fourth District. Vander Plaats noted that King has worked tirelessly during his time in Congress to travel the district and meet constituents. Story County Republican Chair Brett Barker, who is staying neutral in the race, adds that King is \"very engaging with voters one on one\" and says \"that helps insulate him from some of the media controversies that he's had.\" In deeply Republican Sioux County, where King got 72% of the vote in 2018 and 80% in 2016, Republican county chair Tammy Kobza is backing King. \"He's the one that will best defend America, its greatness and Donald Trump's agenda,\" she said. \u00a0 Kobza hears from people who are upset King was stripped of his committee assignments \"because it was based on lies.\" And as for the outside money pouring into the primary, she says, \"Fourth District people don't like outside people trying to tell us who to vote for.\" \"It's one of many factors,\" Kobza said about whether that spending would motivate people to support King. \"Not only that, it's Steve King's record, Steve King's integrity, Steve King's leadership and his backbone.\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "It was April 2020, and Tesla founder Elon Musk was angry. The target of his ire: social distancing measures imposed by California state officials amid the coronavirus pandemic. \"If somebody wants to stay in their house, that's great,\" Musk said in an earnings call reviewed by CBS News. \"...But to say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.\" But is it? Before 2016, the word \"fascism\" popped up mostly in history lessons or political analysis of autocratic states or the occasional terror group. But President Donald Trump's years in office have seen a surge in \"fascism\" talk from both supporters and opponents\u00a0using the word to describe their political adversaries. Can all of them be right? Of course not. Before you think about using the term yourself, here's what you should know about what \"fascism\" really means\u2026 and what it doesn't. Fascism is generally defined as a political movement that embraces far-right nationalism and the forceful suppression of any opposition, all overseen by an authoritarian government. Fascists strongly oppose Marxism, liberalism and democracy, and believe the state takes precedence over individual interests. They favor centralized rule, often a single party or leader, and embrace the idea of a national rebirth, a new greatness for their country. Economic self-sufficiency is prized, often through state-controlled companies. Youth, masculinity and strength are highly fetishized. The first modern fascist parties emerged in the aftermath of World War I. The ideology swept through Italy \u2014 the birthplace of the term \u2014 then Germany and other parts of Europe. German intellectual Johann Plenge expected that class divisions would disappear in favor of \"racial comrades,\" and that the future of Germany lay in \"national socialism.\" That phrase is often shortened to \"Nazism,\" which is a form of fascism. The movement gave birth to infamous strongmen such as Adolph Hitler in Germany and Italy's Benito Mussolini, who, like many fascists, saw violence \u2014 violent revolution of governments, violent punishment of opponents \u2014 as key factors in fascism.\u00a0 Fascists also tend to embrace imperialism and the conquering of weaker nations. Mussolini was especially impressed with the ambitious expansion and militarism of ancient Rome. Hitler, an early admirer of Mussolini and his tactics, modeled his Nazi party on Italy's fascism in the 1920s. Fascist regimes often meddle directly in their national economies, casting a suspicious eye on the perceived decadence of a system that relies too heavily on capitalism. The result: nationalized companies and cartels in key areas, such as manufacturing.\u00a0 The end of World War II saw the downfall of several fascist regimes, but not all. In Spain, Francisco Franco, who incorporated fascist elements in his military dictatorship, hung around for several decades, while other governments, such as that of Juan Per\u00f3n in Argentina, enacted a kind of fascism-lite, modeling its economy somewhat after fascist Italy. Amid the horrors of World War II, the word \"fascist\" eroded from a neutral description to an insult.\u00a0 \"Except for the relatively small number of Fascist sympathizers,\" George Orwell wrote in 1944, \"almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist'. That is about as near to a definition as this much-abused word has come.\" More recently, people also started to use the word to \u2014 inaccurately \u2014 describe any kind of far-right or violent group, as well as a range of authoritarian socialist or communist regimes such as Cuba's.\u00a0 Then-Congressman Ron Paul, a libertarian-leaning Republican, did not intend any compliments in 2012 when he warned, correctly or not, that America was \"slipping into a fascist system.\"\u00a0 \"We've slipped away from a true republic,\" Paul said. \"Now we're slipping into a fascist system where it's a combination of government and big business and authoritarian rule and the suppression of the individual rights of each and every American citizen.\" In the 21st century, foreign policy experts have raised the alarm about a number of government shifting in the direction of fascism, or, at least, fascism-lite. Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has pointed to the emergence of increasingly authoritarian leaders in countries such as Hungary, Turkey, the Philippines, Poland and Venezuela. \"We should be awake to the assault on democratic values that has gathered strength in many countries abroad and that is dividing America at home,\" she writes in her 2018 book, \"Fascism: A Warning.\" President Trump's approach to campaigning and leadership has drawn comparisons to fascist-style authoritarianism. In a September 2020 interview, his Democratic rival Joe Biden pointed out some similarities. Trump is \"sort of like [Joseph] Goebbels,\" Biden told MSNBC, referring to the head of Nazi Germany's infamous propaganda machine. \"You say the lie long enough, keep repeating it, repeating it, repeating it, it becomes common knowledge.\" Political scientists see some troubling parallels, too. \"'Making the country great again' sounds exactly like the fascist movements. \u2026 That is a fascist stroke,\" Robert Paxton, a leading authority on fascism, told Slate. \"An aggressive foreign policy to arrest the supposed decline. That's another one. Then, there's a second level, which is a level of style and technique. He even looks like Mussolini in the way he sticks his lower jaw out, and also the bluster, the skill at sensing the mood of the crowd, the skillful use of media.\" Even some\u00a0Hollywood stars\u00a0have likened President Trump to fascist leaders. But is that comparison accurate? It's true Mr. Trump has signaled encouragement for some of his more violent supporters, and he's sent federal forces into cities where protests were simmering. That \"Make America great again\" slogan does sound a lot like a call for a national rebirth. He has publicly flirted with holding onto the presidency beyond the legal limit of two terms, and has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the 2020 election \u2014 prompting critics to warn those look like steps toward authoritarianism. But in at least a few key areas, the fascism label doesn't fit. President Trump has not embraced foreign military invasions as a way to make America great again \u2014 in fact, he campaigned on a promise to bring troops home. And he doesn't obsess over youth as particularly important in America's great rebirth. Even Albright doesn't think Trump quite falls into the fascism category, though she's disturbed by the similarities.\u00a0 \"I think Trump is the most undemocratic president I have ever seen in American history,\" she has said. \"I'm saying that there's certain elements of the kinds of behavior that he has that reminds me of a variety of issues that have taken place.\" Among them, she said, were Trump's attacks\u00a0on the press and acting \"as though he's above the law.\" Despite the differences, vocal opponents of fascism \u2014 such as the loosely affiliated activists who go by antifa (short for \"anti-fascist\") \u2014 generally see themselves as anti-Trump as well.",

Devermont discusses areas of instability on the continent and the areas where the U.S. has an opportunity to pursue national interests. He reviews areas of progress and setbacks in governance and security, and explains why he believes there has been a 'democratization of leadership' in Africa. Devermont also reviews Chinese and Russian investments and operations on the continent, and explains why they each have significant long-term implications for U.S. security.

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - JUDD DEVERMONT CORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELL PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON \tMICHAEL MORELL: Judd, welcome to the show. It's great to have you on Intelligence Matters. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Thank you for having me. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So maybe the place to start is a little bit about your career. And I'd be interested in a couple things. One is, your interest in Africa, where did that come from? And then, your interest in C.I.A. and where did that come from and how did you end up there? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: You mean why did someone who grew up in Southern California end up spending a career working in Africa? \tMICHAEL MORELL: (LAUGH) Exactly, exactly. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: I love history and in high school, all you can take is U.S. and European. And when I got to college, I just went all over the world: Latin America and Southeast Asia, East Asia. But I took a class on the Arab Revolt, actually, and this seminar class was so incredible, the way in which they talked about how Arab nationalism and agency mixed with geo politics. And so, I kind of knew that's what I wanted, but I still didn't know what the region was. I didn't really want to go in the Middle East. And one day, I didn't go to class, I never miss class, but one day I decided with a friend, we walked around campus and we got in front of a study abroad kiosk. And only two pamphlets jumped at me: Ghana and South Africa. And I don't know, Michael, it was this moment where I could see my entire future. I knew all of those things that I liked in that Arab Spring course or Arab Revolt course were going to be in Africa. I moved to South Africa, I did a year there and I never looked back. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And what was that year in South Africa like? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: It was incredible. I studied at the University of Cape Town. I traveled all over Southern Africa. I lived in the dorms and have great South African friends. And I just found on the continent, history, I had a professor who said, \"History lies heavy\" on the continent's present and future. And so, it was everything that I wanted and it's been incredibly fulfilling, 20 years now. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, for those listeners who haven't been to Cape Town, I've been there twice, you are just absolutely surrounded by history. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah, it's gorgeous. \tMICHAEL MORELL: It is amazing. And then the C.I.A., how did you end up at the C.I.A.? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: This is kind of a funny story. It actually has a lot to do with a Tom Clancy novel, but not because I related to Jack Ryan. I mean, yeah, he's an analyst, but the guy is on operation almost immediately, right? \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right, right. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: I mean, he's never at his desk. And so, I wanted, as I said, a job, I love history, I wanted a job that had a lot to do with history. And in this one Jack Ryan novel, he's not even in the agency anymore, he's like the national security advisor. And he calls up the Department of State to talk to their senior desk officer for Japan. And the way I remembered this passage, I tried to find it recently and I can't, the senior desk officer in Japan knows everything about history, politics, culture, economics. And I said, \"I'm going to be a desk officer. That's my goal.\" Applied for the State Department as an intern, I got in. I was going to be in the Bureau of West African Affairs and just before I left for Washington, my father grabs the intern guide book that I had and says, \"C.I.A. You should apply to C.I.A.\" I said, listen, Pops-- \tMICHAEL MORELL: Why did he say that? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: I think he loves the operation. He continues to tell me he could be a great operational officer. He's 77 years old. But he was really fascinated with the lifestyle and he encouraged me to apply. I said, \"I'm going to be a desk officer, I don't need this.\" He said, \"You should apply.\" So I did. I get to Washington. First day at the Department of State, it's like two hours of paperwork, they say, \"Come back tomorrow for your first full day.\" It's September 11th, 2011. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Wow. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: That was my first day working for the U.S. Government. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Wow. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: And I know where you were and I know you were briefing the President and I was just an intern in West Africa, but I felt a sense of privilege that I was there. It was a great experience. And a couple of weeks later the C.I.A. calls and said, \"We'd like to offer you a grad fellowship.\" So now I'm at a place where C.I.A. seems really interesting, my fantasy desk officer job seems really interesting, I'm very lucky to sort of go to Cote d'Ivoire, work in our embassy for a longer internship and I meet an analyst from INR, State Department's Analytic Wing. She's retired now, but she was phenomenal. I mean, she wasn't even the senior analyst for this country and she had everyone in the palm of her hands. And that was the moment that I said, \"I know exactly where I want to go. It's going to \u00a0 be an analyst.\" \tMICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So in laymen's terms, can you tell folks what it's like to be an analyst at C.I.A.? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. You know, there wasn't a day that I didn't have a smile on my face walking in that door. I came in on the weekends and not because I had a task there, but because I had a paper that I really wanted to write, research. But every day you are immersed in all this information about the country or issue that you work. You have these great colleagues that you are engaging with. Every morning, there's a 9:00 morning meeting and you sort of report up what's interesting, what's happened, what should we be writing about, what do senior policy makers need to know. And then, you spend your day writing those papers or going to briefings or spending time around a table and trying to figure out what's going to happen next and why does it matter. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So you become the National Intelligence Officer for Africa, what does that mean? What does a National Intelligence Officer do? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: It's the best job I've ever had, Michael. It really has three functions. You are the U.S. Government's senior analyst on a country or an issue. You represent all the 17 intelligence agencies, in all policy meetings. C.I.A. might have a seat at the table, but I represented the DNI. And I would do the briefing that usually kicked off these policy meetings. So that was sort of one of the responsibilities. The second is that I oversaw all of the strategic analysis that the intelligence community had, national intelligence estimates, et cetera. C.I.A. might have their view, DIA may have their view, but what was written under my auspices was a community view. And sometimes the community may disagree and we would represent that, as well. And then the third part of the job which I really loved which is I felt responsible for helping to develop our analytic cadre. I would host conferences, I would bring people together, I used to have a product of the month that I would send out, so people could see analytic excellence. \tMICHAEL MORELL: That's great. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: It was a fantastic job. Three years, great. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And you also served on the NSC staff on Africa. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yes. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Talk about that. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: I worked in the Obama Administration, I was the Director for Nigeria, Somalia, the Sahel and the African Union. These countries aren't next to each other, but my boss just said, \"All of your  experiences, we're just going to put them into one account.\" And my job was to coordinate U.S. policy. It was a pretty interesting time. We ended up recognizing the Government of Somalia for the first time since 1991. I contributed to the Obama strategy towards Africa. And my job was really to make sure that we were all marching in the same direction. I wrote all the papers for the deputy's committees and other senior meetings so that we could figure out where we're going to go. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So how many countries are in sub Saharan Africa? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: 49. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So how is it possible to keep up with what's going on in 49 countries? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: You know, when I was telling you the story about why I joined, what I wanted to be, it was to be an expert. And I think it's taken me to this point in my career to realize I may never be an expert on 49 countries. So you do a lot of triaging, you work with a lot of smart people. But I find each and every one of them fascinating. And I've had the fortune of working first in West African issues and then I moved to East African and Central African, so I've sort of moved around enough, and then my academic work was on southern. But you have to go into these meetings and present to policy makers real insights into these countries that they may have worked and traveled to together. So it's a lifelong challenge. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And this is a big place, right? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. \tMICHAEL MORELL: The continent is huge. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah, I have a map next to me right now. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, yeah. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Because I have to reference it. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And just the Congo itself is roughly the size of half the United States, right? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yes, right, yeah. \tMICHAEL MORELL: It's a massive continent. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Massive continent. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So this great job that you had in the intelligence community you left in 2018? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Why? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Well, I always think it's important to say it has nothing to do with politics. I spent 18 months as the National Intelligence Officer under President Obama and then 18 months under President Trump, and I actually really liked working and trying to support this administration. It forced me to challenge my assumptions. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So you were the National Intelligence Officer during the Trump [administration]? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yes, for 18 months. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Okay. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: And I had to meet them where they were, which they didn't have the kind of depth that President Obama and his team had on Africa and they had different views and I really enjoyed trying to find ways to communicate the continent's significance and why it matters. But the NIO job was the pinnacle for me. That's the best job you can have in my career of service. I thought maybe in 30 years I would be able to get to that point, and I was about halfway through in my career and I didn't see a job in the community that would sort of push me forward. I wanted a new challenge. And quite honestly, I wanted to do policy again. I really liked being at the NSC, and I wanted to think about what our policy should be. And you know, one of the things you can't do as an analyst is give policy prescriptive. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: So it just seemed like a time to leave at a high point at this incredible position to engage with new people and think about where we should go next. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And as CSIS, you are able to do both the analysis and policies, right? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. It's actually a lot like my old job. I read a lot, I write a lot, but then I have recommendations on what I think we should do. Plus, I get to do things, like I have a podcast, that's fun. I talk to journalists. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Podcasts are the best. (LAUGH) \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Podcasts are the best. You know, I travel a lot. I meet with African and European and other government officials and get to interact with them in a different way, speaking for myself, not for my government. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So Intelligence Matters has now been around for a couple of years, we have never had anybody on talking about Africa. So I think the key question is: How does Africa matter to our national security? And how much does it matter? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. \tMICHAEL MORELL: How do you answer that question? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: This is a difficult question because as we've just talked about, there are 49 countries in sub Saharan Africa, 54, if you include the North African countries. 55 if you're the African Union because you include Western Sahara. And as our interests evolved, the way we look at Africa changes. And if you would just allow me a quick tangent, because this is very nerdy, but if it's going to be successful, it's going to be successful on Intelligence Matters. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Well, you're talking to a nerd, so we're in good shape here. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yes. I teach a class at George Washington University on the History of U.S. Intelligence Analysis in Africa, and I found this piece, a National Intelligence Estimate from 1971 in East Africa, and there's a line in it, maybe you've seen this before, I've never seen it before, the analyst said, \"The significance for the United States of developments in East Africa depends on what the U.S. says is important.\" Right? It sounds circular, but it's true. And then, the analysts go further than that, right? They say if you're going to look at this in a narrow perspective, we don't have many interests, 1971 in East Africa. There's not a product that we get there, we don't have economic investment. But if you step back, and I'm paraphrasing here, if you step back, these are countries that could be models, open societies. These leaders have influence, both in Africa and globally. And if they should go south, if there should be instability, it would affect our interests. And I like to use that story because it tells me don't undersell and don't oversell. Look at all the angles and present all the arguments. So the way that I think about Africa right now is in three ways: First, the future is African, demographically. The continent will double in size. It will go from 1.2 billion people to 2.4 billion people by 2050. That means a quarter of the world's population will be Africa. Nigeria is going to be larger than the United States. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So fastest growth by any continent? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah, fastest growth, youngest continent. Nigeria is going to be the third-largest country in the world, it's going to surpass us. And so, every global problem is going to have an African dimension to it. What is going to be the norms around Internet privacy? How are we going to deal with climate change? There's going to be an African component to that and we need to be mindful of that. Two, and this has been something that I've learned in my career, Africa's problems and opportunities don't stop at the water's edge. What happens in Africa changes the way the world works. African migration crisis changed European politics. The Ebola crisis changes the way we think about global health security. You may remember the piracy off the coast of the Horn of Africa, it changed actually how maritime commerce worked in the shipping industry. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right, right. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: So I think that it's really important to be mindful of these events in these different countries because they do change the way people and systems work. And then finally, our allies and adversaries understand those first two points really well and I think they understand it probably better than we do. We are seeing this dramatic increase in engagement by allies and adversaries. Between 2010 and 2015, 150 foreign embassies were built in sub Saharan Africa. Trade is up for most countries, 65 countries have increased their trade. And military bases all across Africa. Indian Ocean, the Horn of Africa and Western Saharan, I'm sorry, Western Africa. So I think that we have to recognize that if we are not there to shape what is happening on the continent, to referee, to make sure that we are not blocked out by opportunities, it is going to affect our national interests. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So talk a little bit about kind of the state of Africa today. You know, what's going on there? What are the challenges these countries face? And what are some of the positive things that are happening? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Chinua Achebe, the author of Things Fall Apart, said when talking about Nigeria, \"The problem with Nigeria is leadership.\" And I think for many of these countries, leadership and governance and sort of the economic problems that flow from that are still probably the biggest challenges these countries face. There is instability. \tMICHAEL MORELL: It's true. It's true of a lot of countries. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: It's true of a lot of the countries, right? But you know, instability in the Sahel, challenges in Eastern Congo with Ebola, we have been talking for so many years about urbanization and greater connectivity and youth bulge and climate change. And I would argue right now, those things are really coming together. Governance has been hard in Africa, but it's become really complex. And I think some governments are failing in the way they respond to that. And I think it's making conflicts more protracted, more deadly, and I think it is denying people the ability to live their lives. And these all, as we have said, have all these effects for us. But there's some good news stories. And I always like the opportunity to talk about good news because the U.S. media on Africa, it's all negative. I mean, it's disproportionately negative. And  Africa is doing some things that are really interesting. They're going in a different direction than the rest of the world in some cases. So while there's this global recession in democracy, there are people who have less confidence in it. Africans really strongly believe in democracy. 68% of Africans support democratic principles. In some countries, it's like in the 80s. There's been 28 transfers of power since 2015, peaceful, more than half. That's historic. While the rest of the world has become protectionist and imposing tariffs, Africans have created a new continental trade arrangements. It's the largest trading block since the W2O was founded. And finally, while the rest of the world or at least the United States are thinking about pulling out, the Africans are stepping up and they're working together to deal with trans-national threats. So I think those are really good stories. And just the last thing that I think maybe your audience hasn't thought about that is really exciting to me is African soft power. Africa, Africans are changing our global entertainment and cultural trends in ways that I think are unprecedented. Our music, our films, our sports, Africans are shaping it at the lead. And I'd love to see African governments take advantage of their soft power and I'd like to think of ways that our government could be more effective in navigating it. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So find this, you know, cutting against the trend on democracy and trade to be fascinating. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Why is that happening? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Well, let me start with trade first. For the Africans, their economies are too fractured, fragmented. No one's going to invest in the small little Gambia, which just covers the river within Senegal. Inter trade within Africa has been historically low. And the Africans under the leadership of Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, realized that if they are going to increase inter-African trade, if they were going to become a better investment destination, they had to remove some of these barriers. So I think that's what explains the integration, economic integration. On the democracy side, I think it's a number of trend lines that are coming together. First, as I said, still strong support for democracy, but I think there are new ways in which people can organize and mobilize that has changed politics in Africa. As it's become more urban, you've been able to communicate with each other in new ways through telephones and mobile phones. We're seeing more protests on the streets. We're seeing more people push for change. And so, whether it's the uprising in Sudan that ended President Al Bashir's rule or it is the remarkable changes in Ethiopia or just increasingly cyclical transfers of power, I think a number of things are happening that really cut against the grain in both the global trends, as you've talked about, but even the way people think about sub Saharan Africa. Because you can always pull out the autocracy or the democracy that is in recession or is regressing. But if you step back and look at the picture, it's actually very exciting. And what I tell people is, let's not look at this about democracy as up or down, let's look at the forces that have sort of created a status quo around governance are changing. And I expect a lot of volatility. We'll come to you and have these really big surprises and we'll have these setbacks. But I think that people, the governed and the governing, are working on the new rules of the game. And so, it's a really interesting time right now. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Are there countries, and I'm thinking of South Africa, I'm thinking of Nigeria, I'm thinking of Kenya, are there countries that kind of lead the continent? Or is that not a right way of thinking about it? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: U.S. policy has always thought about sort of anchor states: Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Ethiopia. They have outsized military forces, they are loud and vocal globally and on the continent. I don't think that is as true as much anymore. Nigeria has been dealing with its own internal security problems. Their President isn't the most dynamic. Ethiopia is in the middle of a transition; South Africa is way down by economic problems. And so, what I think you've seen is a democratization of leadership in Africa. Different countries step up at different times. So there's not one single voice. You can't as you did under the Bush Administration or under the Obama Administration say, \"Well, Nigeria is going to carry our water in West Africa.\" It just doesn't happen anymore. You've got to, I think, build these coalitions with the Senegals and the Ghanas in some regions and still rely on South Africa and Kenya for other things. \tMICHAEL MORELL: You, Judd, you mentioned earlier that other countries are paying attention to what's going on in Africa. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And seeing some of the opportunities that you talked about. So can you talk a little about what third party actors, namely China and Russia, are doing on the continent? And if there are others, to, that are interesting, please mention those. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. Let me start with China. I think it's really important to say that China poses some threats to the U.S. in what it's doing. But I've been really disappointed with our policy, because we haven't been precise about what we're trying to counter when it comes to China. \tMICHAEL MORELL: With China? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: With China. We seem to want to focus on blocking them at every turn in sub Saharan Africa. And I don't know, it's like mad libs right now. It's we are worried about activity, fill in the blank, in country, fill in the blank, because of China. And I don't even think we have articulated at least publicly what is the end state that we are looking for. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And it's that \"because of China\" that is the driver, right? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah, it's the because of China. And I think that if we are going to be effective at managing what China is doing in sub Saharan Africa, we need to be specific about what the threats are. So I would say, first of all, it's Chinese investment in critical infrastructure. Ports. We just did a paper at CSIS, 46 ports the Chinese are invested in, operating or building in Africa. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And that's a risk because--? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: That's a risk because it can limit our mobility, our access to these countries, our ability for our military, our ability for our private sector to get involved. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And the Chinese port could eventually become a Chinese military base? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Absolutely. That's what we saw in Djibouti. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: So I worry about ports. I worry about cyber and telecoms. The Chinese have built about 70% of Africa's 4G, it will be 100% of their 5G. Even satellites, Africa is starting to launch more and more satellites and the Chinese are behind it. So we should focus on that. We should focus on the people-to-people investment that China is doing. They're actually focusing on winning hearts and minds. More African students study in China than they do in the United States. China has a program now where they're trying to provide satellite television to 10,000 villages. I think that's decadal, the impacts of that. But the thing about China that gets the most oxygen in Washington is economics. And here is where I think we need to be a lot more nuanced. China is addressing the needs of Africans. This is a region that has the lowest railroad density in the world. They need between $130 billion and $170 billion of infrastructure investments per year, according to the African Development Bank, and China is doing a lot of that stuff. So what we need to do with China in my view is we can't tell Africans not to take the money, because our private sector is not providing that. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: China does $200 billion a year and we do $40 billion. But we can help them to make sure the deals are better, that they don't discriminate against the U.S. private sector, that they have the environmental regulations. So that's how I think about China.  \tMICHAEL MORELL: So Russia. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah, Russia is an easier conversation that China, right? I don't need much nuance. There is very few upsides to what Russia is doing. Essentially, President Putin needs permissive environments for his companies to invest in after the sanctions were imposed on his government and he's looking to score points. Africa is a place where he can work asymmetrically. They don't do much that helps African economies. They sell arms. They're the largest exporter of arms to Africa in the world. They are involved in oil and gas industries, in energy. But often, that comes with a side of corruption. What they're really doing is being fairly disruptive to politics. If they have an opportunity to side with an autocrat to provide technical expertise to help Al Bashir stay in power, that's what they'll do. So they are looking to sell themselves as returning to the glory days of the Soviet Union in Africa. And I think one of the things that we need to be careful about is not call them a great power. They're not. And I think when we call them a great power in Africa, we do Putin's bidding. They're a minnow. At least compared to us, the Chinese and Europe. So I think that we need to do a better job at isolating and not elevating Russia. We need to close some of the loops that make it permissive for their companies to work in this area. And we need to be better about gauging Africans to inoculate them from these kinds of intrusions. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Are there big European players? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah, France is still very involved. And in fact, President Macron just recently had a summit where he talked about what his government is doing on the Sahel. The U.K., the week of this recording, just had its first U.K. Africa Investment Summit. Malta, I don't know why I'm sharing this, but Malta just came out with their own Africa strategy, just to give you a sense of the diversity here. The other region that I should spend just a second talking about is the Gulf. The Gulf is very active in Africa and Turkey is very active in Africa. In some cases, that's not bad, they're doing some of the investments. DP Ports is investing in lots of places all over the continent. But what they've done that has been really negative is they have exported their political riffs to the region and it's been problematic for Somalia and countries that don't want to choose between the UAE on one side and Qatar on the other side. Turkey has also been involved on the commerce commercial side. They are doing some security assistance. As I said, it's a crowded space. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So extremist, Jihadist extremism, seems to be to be a growing problem on the continent. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Is that right? And if so, why is it happening and how much of a threat is it to Europe, to us? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. We have to remember that Al-Qaeda's major attack was in Africa, right, against our embassies in Tanzania, in Kenya. But in the last couple decades, I think the problem has become more diverse, more geographically dispersed and more deadly. There are Al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliates in West and East Africa and Southern Africa. We are seeing unaligned extremist groups like Boko Haram. The number of attacks that they are doing are increasing and I think the lethality of them are increasing. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Primarily against local targets? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Primarily against local targets. So in Nigeria, for example, according to a Council on Foreign Relations Database, 35,000 have died from Boko Haram in ISIS West Africa attacks or in conflict between those groups and the Nigerian military. In the Sahel, there's been a fivefold increase in deaths since 2016, 4,000 people. So it's primarily African targets. But I just testified in front of the House, and what I said is that it's probably a low probability that they are going to attack the U.S. directly, but I think it has some significant impacts for us. First of all, it endangers our citizens that live in Africa and our economic investments. There was an attack by Al-Shabaab earlier this year, where they hit a Kenya military base, where the U.S. trains Kenyans and an American service person died and two contractors. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: They tried to attack our base in Somalia, as well. And Americans have been caught up in the hotel attacks and the mall attacks. There is a group affiliated with ISIS right near a huge L&G find in Mozambique. So it does threaten our interests about the people who live in Africa, our facilities and our economic investments. It also, as it continues to fester, entangles us in very expensive peace keeping and humanitarian operations. So I think we need to be proactive when we think about that there is the secondary effects. And the last one is the more that extremist deepens and we are seen as less responsive, I think we lose the trust of our partners. I mean, Macron made a very clear pitch that he felt like the U.S. wasn't there helping. Our African partners have said the same. And Russia, particularly, has rushed in to kind of find an opportunity here. So it's not a direct threat to the homeland, but a huge amount of sort of impacts downstream. \tMICHAEL MORELL: What's behind the expansion of extremism on the continent? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah, I think partly it's a matter of governance and poor governance. And I think the affiliates, Al-Qaeda and ISIS have been sort of shopping for partners. I try to be very careful about talking about ISIS and AQ as if they're drivers because we don't want to lose the local elements. It's just as helpful for the local extremist group to work with Al-Qaeda and ISIS as it is vice versa. \tMICHAEL MORELL: So in a lot of cases, these groups existed already with local grievances and then they took on the name? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yes, yes, yeah. They take on the name and there is a back and forth between the network and the local group and the network doesn't always get what it wants. But I think that those relationships have improved recruitment, have improved some of the tactical and strategic efforts maybe even to help them, like, IEDs and other things. So I think poor governance, the attraction of networking with these groups and then the most important part is government mistakes. There is a study by UNDP that looked at sort of extremists in Africa and 71% of militants, former militants, said they joined an extremist group because a family member or friend was abused, detained by the security forces. So many of these African militaries make the wrong moves that push people further into the arms of the extremists. So those are a couple of the things that I would highlight is why we keep seeing this proliferation of these groups. \tMICHAEL MORELL: You talked earlier about the expansion of democracy. You talked earlier about poor governance, extremism now being a consequence of that poor governance. Is there a correlation or causation between a state being more democratic and the quality of its governance in Africa? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. Oh, sorry, I thought you were going to go in a different direction. I thought you were going to as whether or not correlation between democracy and extremist activity, which there is actually some good evidence. On the democracy and the governance, I don't have the numbers. But my experience says that it depends, right? I mean, if you are a democratic state and you are being responsive to your citizens, then in theory, the governance will improve over time. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right, right, right. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: But in some cases, what happens is because the democracy, people are elected through (UNINTEL) networks, that you can actually use corruption to sort of focus on your own personal constituents, as opposed to the betterment of your total population. So you really have to go case by case to talk about, you know, where are all people benefiting versus people who are sort of in the circle of the President and the ruling party? \tMICHAEL MORELL: So Judd, I think this is a good place to switch to U.S. policy and maybe we'll finish up on this. U.S. policy toward the region. How would you characterize it? What's working? What's not? If  you could advise the President, what would you tell him? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Yeah. You know, I think that our policy makers on Africa are stuck with the challenge of being asked to do less with less. And it's taken them a while to I think figure out how they are going to push policy. And I want to give them some credit because it's taken a little while, but I've been happy with some of the results, but just to kind of go back a little bit. Like in many other parts of the world, we didn't have policy makers on Africa for a long time in Washington or in the field. And so, there was this period where it was really this unhappy marriage between Obama policies they weren't sure they were going to dismantle and Trump policies that hadn't been constructed yet. And so, you've got a lot of contractions. And then you had Tweets and other sorts of, you know, travel bans that made things worse. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Right, right, right. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: And then President Trump's national security advisor, John Bolton, unveils the strategy, and this doesn't go off very well either because it's almost entirely about Russia and China. The Africans felt like they were not part of the strategy. But in the last year, I've been pleased with the bureaucracy finding a way. They launched an economic initiative called Prosper Africa, it's a lot to go still, but it's a good step, right? It's addressing some of the challenges that the U.S. private sectors had in investing in Africa. They've kind of found their footing on democracy and governance, which isn't really in any of the strategy documents or speeches. But sanctions now on election spoilers in Nigeria, on corrupt officials in Kenya, on people who are stopping the peace process in South Sudan. So those are positive. The big question in year four is: Where is the DOD going? And you may know there is a proposal in front of Secretary of Defense Esper about withdrawing maybe even completely our troops in Africa, about 6,000 people. They already had reduced West African forces about 10%. I think this is a really dangerous policy. I think it's reckless. \tMICHAEL MORELL: And they are there supporting local forces who are fighting extremists? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Local forces, yeah. And it's not just sort of the CT side of the house, they're building capacity for Africans to deal with security challenges and they're there at the request of African governments. And we are there in partnership with our European friends. And this has caused great anxiety amongst the global community that we may walk away from the continent. We have done this before and it wasn't very good. So you may know, Michael, that in the '90s, we dramatically reduced our presence in Africa. And then after 9/11 and the growing CT threat, we realized, actually, we need to be back. So reset those relationships. Rebuild capacity. Reinvest in infrastructure. A lack of DOD presence is going to not only, you know, make us seem less committed to these challenges, but there are the other effects. Our  diplomats and our development officers depend on the military to get out to these hard-to-reach places. I think our analysts are going to have a harder time understanding dynamics in Africa if there is less U.S. presence in these places. So I'm really concerned. I'm elated that the Hill has stepped up. Senator Graham, Senator Coons, a number of people on the House side have said this is a bad idea. And hopefully, Secretary Esper will decide not to do this. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. And if we're not there, who fills the vacuum? \tJUDD DEVERMONT: Right, exactly. Our adversaries. \tMICHAEL MORELL: Judd, thank you so much for joining us. \tJUDD DEVERMONT: My pleasure. Thank you. \t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "After 34 candidates, 14 debates and $2.5 billion total spent by both presidential nominees, Election Day 2020 is finally here. Here are the places, themes, and potential voting issues we'll be watching tonight. And don't forget - CBSNews.com will be providing live updates throughout Election Night. To follow along, go to\u00a0cbsnews.com/election. -CBS News Political Unit After zig-zagging many of the nation's battleground states Monday, President Donald Trump closed out his re-election bid in the same fashion as 2016: a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan that bled into Election Day. \"We're gonna win the state of Michigan so easily. We want to do it just like last time, but let's give me a bit little more margin than that if you don't mind,\" the president quipped. Yet as the nation confronts an unprecedented pandemic, its economic fallout and a nation divided over issues of race and culture,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says President Trump spent the final moments of his campaign venting about the media, his impeachment and America's electoral process. If ballot counting in Pennsylvania extends several days, as predicted, Mr. Trump told supporters in Scranton, \"cheating can happen like you have never seen.\" The president kicked off his Election Day morning with an early appearance on \"Fox & Friends,\" where he reasoned his campaign has a \"very, very solid chance of winning.\" Mr. Trump also dropped by his campaign headquarters in Arlington, Virginia to thank staff members before retreating to the White House to watch returns. About 400 of his closest supporters will gather for an election night party in the East Room of the White House, tonight. The mood inside the Biden campaign is positive and optimistic about Joe Biden's chances for victory, several campaign sources tell\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. One sign of this optimism is Biden's recent travel schedule: in the past few weeks, he has campaigned in Georgia, Iowa, and Ohio, reliably red states in previous recent elections. But the campaign's number one priority is clearly Pennsylvania, as Biden spent his last two days with seven stops in the state. As polls opened Tuesday, Biden started his day in his native Scranton and will then head to Philadelphia, where the goal has been to turn out suburban and non-White voters. After polls close, Biden is expected to address the nation from Wilmington, Delaware \"probably late\" into the evening, according to his campaign manager. Throughout the day on Tuesday, Biden's campaign said in order to counter suggestions of electoral impropriety by the president and his campaign, they will be sharing data from early voting counts and their internal return figures. CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0says more than 100 million people have already cast their ballots. Nationally, voters have cast 72.3% of the total votes counted in the 2016 general election. On Monday, Montana (102.4%) and Washington (105.4%) became the third and fourth states to surpass their 2016 turnout following Hawaii and Texas. Other high performing states include Arizona(92.9%), Colorado (95.8%), Florida (93.7&), Georgia (93.9%), Nevada (96.7%), New Mexico (97.3%), North Carolina (95.4%) and Oregon (95.8%). Looking at early vote battleground totals there are 3 groups emerging: states that already have +90% of their 2016 turnout (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Texas); states that are hovering around mid-50-mid-60% (Iowa Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin); and two states well below those (New Hampshire and Pennsylvania). For decades a reliably red state, CBS News now rates Arizona's 11 electoral votes as a \"toss up\" going into Election Day. The overwhelming majority of Arizonans have for years cast their ballots by mail, though election officials are still bracing for record turnout Tuesday, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Flipping this state would be a historic victory for Democrats, banking here in large part on trends that are buoying Democrats in suburbs across the country. Republicans still outnumber Democrats and independents here by 3 points\u00a0among registered voters. But the Biden campaign and former astronaut Mark Kelly, who is challenging incumbent Republican Senator Martha McSally for her seat this year, have poured resources into everything from courting Republican and split-ticket voters to boosting Latino turnout among their base in this border state, key factors in a 2018 Senate win they hope to replicate this year. The Florida Division of Elections reported Tuesday morning that 9 million votes have been cast in the battleground state of Florida, where 14.4 million voters are registered to participate in the 2020 general election. With more than half of the ballots already cast, Democrats are outpacing Republicans with 673,838 more mail-in ballots. However, Republicans are edging out Democrats with 558,412 more in-person early votes cast. On this Election Day, we'll continue to monitor voter turnout to see if this state might break its 1992 general election voter turnout record of 83%. All other voters throughout the state have until 7 p.m. on Election Day to cast their ballots. Another thing we'll be watching is whether voters wait up to the minute to drop off ballots in drop boxes or try to vote in-person. Miami-Dade County has been tabulating votes since October 15. As one election official described it, the voting machines are calculators that have been counting votes since October 15, so on Election Day at 7 p.m., their office is able to hit the \"equal sign,\" adding them all up. As a result, we'll be looking at the timeline in which Florida counties begin releasing election results. In Miami-Dade, vote-by-mail results that were received prior to Election Day are scheduled to be released at 7 p.m. At 7:30 p.m. early voting totals in the county are slated to be released and every 30 minutes after this point, the precincts will report their totals. The last votes counted will be ballots that are dropped off on Election Day and while the hope is for results to be in by 10 p.m., one county board of elections spokesperson told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that during the state primary in August, 20,000 ballots were brought in on Election Day and their team didn't leave the building until 2:30 a.m., when all the ballots were counted. In Broward County, the second largest county in the state,\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0says we'll be keeping tabs on election management because as one Florida-based union organizer put it, \"if there are issues with the election in Florida, they'll happen in Broward.\" In 2018, the former Democratic Broward County supervisor of elections resigned after a controversial vote recount in the Senate race between Rick Scott and Bill Nelson highlighted issues within the county's board of elections office. GEORGIA In Georgia, 3.9 million votes have been cast as of 8 p.m. on October 31. In a state with 7.6 million registered voters, we'll be watching to see how the state's historic early voter turnout translates into Election Day in-person voter turnout. In Fulton County -- the largest county in the state by population --CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that a county election official told reporters Monday that if 150,000 Georgia voters turn out on Election Day, the county will be looking at 80% turnout for this election. Also in Fulton, we'll be monitoring long lines and whether technical difficulties arise with voting machines or the ability to process voter information during check-in. These are all issues that have come up in previous elections this year. A Fulton County election official told reporters Monday that in some cases, the team has re-allocated voting equipment and moved some devices from areas with lower turnout to polling places with higher voter turnout. In October there was a report that Fulton County election officials in one warehouse had tested positive for COVID-19. A county election official said Monday that in total there were 25 confirmed positive coronavirus cases in the warehouse, and October 23 is the last time anyone tested positive. In addition, Fulton County has announced that Atlanta police officers will be assigned to each polling site in the county to ensure safety amid potential security concerns. IOWA President Trump and former Vice President Biden both visited Iowa in the final days of the campaign. Some recent polls have suggested the presidential race in Iowa will be closer than 2016 when Trump won the state by more than 9 points, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. President Trump campaigned on the eastern edge of the state on Sunday while Biden campaigned in Des Moines on Friday. Mr. Trump won many of the eastern counties by double digits in 2016 but the area is traditionally blue collar with Democratic roots and could swing back to Biden. The Des Moines suburbs saw several state house seats flip red to blue in 2018. Keep an eye on Dallas County, which has long been Republican but also trending Democrat in recent elections. Marshall County is another area to keep in mind. While Iowa is overwhelmingly White, the largest minority population is Latino. Marshall County is 23% Latino and Obama won here by 9 points in 2012 but in 2016 President Trump won by 8.5 points. Many of the voters in this county work in agriculture and meatpacking plants, which were hit hard by coronavirus outbreaks this summer. Lastly, independent voters were part of the reason Mr. Trump won the state in 2016. In the fall, polling showed President Trump's support with independent voters was fading but in recent days, he's regained much of that support that will be critical to winning the state again this year. MICHIGAN President Trump is hoping to repeat his 2016 victory in Michigan, when he was the first Republican to win the state since former President George H.W. Bush in 1988. Mr. Trump narrowly won Michigan, and its 16 Electoral College votes, by 10,708 votes four years ago, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. He was fueled by significant support from White voters without college degrees throughout the state (62%-31%) and carrying independent voters by 16 points (52%-36%), according to exit polls. Democrats also saw a drop in turnout in some key strongholds, including Detroit. Mr. Trump closed out his campaign with a rally in Grand Rapids, just as he did four years ago. He held four rallies in the state between Friday and Election Day. Meanwhile, Democratic nominee Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama campaigned in Flint and Detroit on Saturday. Democrats are hoping to build off of their success in the 2018 midterm elections, when the party swept statewide elections, thanks in part to large support from suburban voters and women. One of the key places to watch as returns come in from Michigan is\u00a0Kent County, a longtime GOP stronghold that Governor Gretchen Whitmer won in 2018. The suburbs around Detroit in\u00a0Oakland and Macomb counties\u00a0will also play a pivotal role. Macomb County is a swing county home to many working-class voters that make up the president's base that he carried by 11.5 points in 2016. Oakland County is a wealthier county that's been safe territory for Democrats in recent presidential elections and Biden's team is hoping to build on Hillary Clinton's 8-point win in 2016. Another key piece to the puzzle is whether Democrats will be able to boost turnout with Black voters in cities like\u00a0Detroit, where turnout fell by about 40,000 votes from 2012 to 2016. Republicans have also made a significant push to increase their support with Black voters in Michigan. Finally, keep an eye on whether Mr. Trump can hang on to traditionally Democratic counties that have many White working-class voters, like Saginaw and Bay counties, and if he can hold or boost his margins in rural places like Michigan's Upper Peninsula. MINNESOTA Minnesota offers 10 electoral votes and has been a top target for President Trump and his campaign since narrowly losing the state to Hillary Clinton in 2016. A Republican candidate for president has not won the state since 1972. Since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Biden has made two stops to Minnesota, while Mr. Trump has made three trips to the state since September 1. The latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll rates this as \"Lean Dem.\" In 2016, the president made inroads in the Iron Range, where there is a historically strong Democratic coalition of blue-collar workers. Both Mr. Trump and Vice President Pence have made trips to the region pitching an economic message. CBS News polling shows that more White non-college educated voters in Minnesota believe that Mr. Trump will be better than Biden on manufacturing, agricultural and farming issues. But the poll also found that Biden has clear advantages over Mr. Trump with college-educated White women. Biden's margin among that demographic is 13 points better than how Mrs. Clinton performed among that demographic in 2016. The poll showed that Biden's margin is closer to what helped power Democrats to regain the House in 2018. Months after the killing of George Floyd, a majority of Minnesota registered voters agreed with the ideas of the Black Lives Matter movement, according to CBS News polling. In addition, the poll found that 62% of Minnesota registered voters believe that police reforms are the best way to address racial and systemic discrimination. The Iron Range region will be a place to watch to see if Mr. Trump can continue to build off his 2016 performance to make Minnesota a close race. In addition, turnout in the Twin Cities and its metro area will be interesting as a U.S. appeals court ruled five days before Election Day that absentee ballots received within seven days after Election Day will be segregated, so it's possible these ballots may not be counted. There was a consent decree order in place for months that allowed absentee ballots postmarked on or before Election Day to be received up to a week after Election Day. Following the ruling, Democrats, including Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, have pushed voters to drop off their mail-in ballot at a ballot drop box by 3 p.m. on Election Day or to vote in person to ensure that their vote counts. In a press call on Monday, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon urged voters to check the status of their ballot if they have mailed in their ballot. If their ballot is still in transit and has not been received by their county or their city, they can vote in person to override the ballot in transit. \"That's not considered voting twice and the reason it isn't, is because there's a barcode attached to every single ballot that connects that ballot and that intended voter with a ballot,\" Simon said on Monday. \"And so that will just be canceled. The in-transit ballot upon voting in person will be canceled.\" On Monday, Simon said his office does not know if there will be post-election litigation over the segregation of ballots, but he did note that his office does not plan to have separate vote tallies. He also mentioned that if any individual or entity wants to invalidate the segregated ballots, they need to \"ask the court to specifically invalidate certain ballots that are in that pile.\" Simon added, \"The physical ballots will be segregated and the vote counts, but we are not going to be weighing, you know, separate vote tallies. It will be a running total through Tuesday, November 10.\" As of November 2, there are 3,588,563 registered Minnesotans, according to data from the Minnesota Secretary of State's office. Minnesota has received 2,055,519 absentee and mail only requests and 1,716,575 of those ballots have been accepted, which amounts to 58% of 2016 turnout, according to Simon. There are 338,944 outstanding absentee ballots. NEVADA Capped by a push over the final weekend by a stream of high-profile surrogates - from Governor Gavin Newsom out of neighboring California to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who won Nevada's caucus earlier this year -- the Biden campaign has rushed to shore up support in a state where Democrats in recent years captured nearly every statewide office and both of Nevada's U.S. Senate seats. Nevada is among the states to mail ballots to all active registered voters this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, though in-person early voting has also drawn record lines as well, notes\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. In Southern Nevada, the majority-minority communities that had manned the state's now-crippled hospitality industry have been a key factor in recent Democratic successes in the state. The Trump campaign's longshot bid to retake the Silver State's six electoral votes will hang in large part on whether the Democrats' famed turnout machine here can overcome new GOTV obstacles posed by the pandemic. NEW HAMPSHIRE Home to the closest Trump-Clinton voter margin in 2016, Democrats won by approximately 3,000 votes here last presidential cycle. This time around, the Trump campaign hopes to put the state that gave President Trump his first 2016 primary win in their column. But no longer helped by a third-party vote, all signs point to the Granite State remaining blue.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says Democrats have out-registered Republicans in the Granite State and flipped both chambers of the state legislature in 2018. President Trump visited the Granite State earlier this month, but Joe Biden has not returned since his expedited swing ahead of New Hampshire's Democratic Primary in February. All five voters in the tiny New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch, which is the first town to vote in the country, cast their ballots for Joe Biden at the stroke of midnight on Election Day. NORTH CAROLINA North Carolina has also seen unprecedented early voting totals this cycle. To date, 4,578,596 votes have been cast in a state that has roughly 7.4 million registered voters in the 2020 general election. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that voter protection organizations like Democracy NC will be ensuring that voters can cast their ballots and get their questions answered at their polling place on Election Day. Thousands volunteered to serve as \"Vote Protectors,\" in part to provide turnout data updates to voters as they head into their polling place to vote. OHIO The historical battleground state of Ohio has 18 electoral votes up for grabs, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. President Trump won this state in 2016, after President Obama won the state twice. The Buckeye State has picked the winner of the presidential election since 1964 and a Republican president has never won the White House without winning Ohio. Since September 1, both Mr. Trump and Joe Biden have made three trips to the state, including for the first presidential debate in Cleveland. The latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll currently rates this race as a \"toss up.\" Similar to other states, the economy is a top issue in Ohio and likely Ohio voters believe Mr. Trump will do a better job on handling economic issues and protecting manufacturing jobs, according to the latest CBS News polling. At an event in Cleveland on Monday, Biden criticized Mr. Trump for diminishing the work of public health officials and for his handling of COVID-19. \"Trump said he was going to fire Dr. Fauci. Isn't that wonderful?\" Biden quipped in Cleveland. \"I got a better idea. Elect me and I am going to hire Dr. Fauci and we are going to fire Donald Trump.\" In 2016, the president performed well with rural voters, with White voters with a college degree and with White voters without a college degree. CBS News polling showed that the president still has a sizable margin with White voters without a college degree but has lost significant support among White voters with a college degree. According to 2016 exit polls, Mr. Trump won White voters with a college degree by 15 percentage points, but the latest CBS News poll showed that Biden has a 12-point margin over Mr. Trump with that demographic. Some of the battlegrounds within the state to keep an eye on include turnout in the metropolitan cities of Columbus, Cincinnati and Cleveland. In addition, Democrats are hoping to break into Mr. Trump's support in the suburbs of these cities. There are nine pivot counties -- counties that voted for Mr. Obama and flipped for Mr. Trump -- and one of those counties is Trumbull County, which was home to the General Motors Lordstown plant. The plant closed in 2019 resulting in job layoffs after Mr. Trump visited the county in 2017 and urged industrial workers to not sell their homes. According to Secretary of State's Frank LaRose's office, there are 8,073,829 registered Ohio voters as of November 1. PENNSYLVANIA President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden both consider Pennsylvania an essential state to winning the election, with Mr. Trump making 12 trips there this year and Biden making 18 since becoming the Democratic nominee. But if the results are close there, the country might not know the state's results until sometime after today, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. For the first time in a general election, Pennsylvanians can cast ballots by mail without an excuse for doing so. Fears of contracting COVID-19 at the polls drove mail voting numbers to multiples of what was expected in the state's June primary, causing some counties to take as long as two weeks to count all their ballots. And the state Supreme Court in September\u00a0extended\u00a0the deadline for counties to accept ballots returned by mail to three days after Election Day, so long as they don't show a postmark from after it. Mr. Trump's campaign has signaled it will continue attempts to convince the U.S. Supreme Court to overrule the extension. In Pennsylvania's primary, over 100,000 mail ballots\u00a0arrived\u00a0at county offices after the election. That number could double in the general election, and if the court decides to throw those ballots out, it could swing the election. Mr. Trump won the state by only about 44,000 votes in 2016. TEXAS Democrats are hoping that 2020 may finally be the year that they turn Texas blue, but Republicans are feeling confident that they'll be able to keep the state in the GOP's win column, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. There are 38 electoral college votes on the line in the Lone Star State. President Trump visited Texas several times over the past two years, including several White House official events, campaign fundraisers and a few rallies. Democratic nominee Joe Biden hasn't been to Texas since the Democratic primary, but his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, went to Texas Friday October 30, the final day of early voting in an effort to boost turnout. More people have already voted in Texas than during the 2016 election. Democrats hope that record turnout may put them over the edge to make Biden the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Texas since Jimmy Carter. A recent\u00a0New York Times/Siena College poll\u00a0showed the president leading the state by 4 points. One of the key areas to watch will be in the Dallas metroplex. While Dallas County has been reliably Democratic in recent presidential elections, the neighboring counties that make up the metroplex, Tarrant (Fort Worth), Collin and Denton, have been strong for Republicans. Former President Lyndon Johnson was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win any of those counties. The areas have experienced some demographic change, including people moving in from out of state as companies relocate. Beto O'Rourke won Tarrant by less than 1 point in 2018 and closed the gap in Collin and Denton counties compared to Mr. Trump's margins in 2016. Houston and its more traditionally Republican suburbs will also play a crucial role. Harris County, home to Houston, has seen record voting in this election. Texas' 5.6 million eligible Latino voters are second only to California's 7.9 million, according to\u00a0Pew. The New York Times poll showed Biden leading with Latino voters, 57%-34%. The Rio Grande Valley will be a key place to watch for Latino turnout. President Trump will also be looking to keep his solid margins in Texas' smaller cities and rural areas. WISCONSIN President Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to win Wisconsin since Ronald Reagan in 1984. He captured the Badger State's 10 Electoral College votes by 22,748 votes. According to exit polls, Mr. Trump's success in Wisconsin, as it was in other Rust Belt states that he flipped in 2016, was fueled by White voters without college degrees (62%-34%) and winning enough independent voters (50%-40%).\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says Democrats also saw turnout drop in critical cities like Milwaukee during that election and young voters, 18-29, backed Hillary Clinton by just 3 points, according to exit polls. Mr. Trump has made 10 campaign trips to Wisconsin since the start of 2019, including holding 5 rallies from October 17 - November 2. Biden has made three trips to Wisconsin since becoming the Democratic nominee. Democrats had a strong showing during the 2018 midterms. They won back the governor's mansion, and other statewide seats, and held on to a Democratic U.S. Senate seat. One of the key areas to watch in Wisconsin are the so-called\u00a0BOW counties(Brown, Outagmie and Winnebago) in northeast Wisconsin, which are home to many White working-class voters. This includes Green Bay and its surrounding areas. Former President Barack Obama won the counties by 10.8 points in 2008 and narrowly lost them by 0.2 points in 2012. In 2016 Mr. Trump carried the counties by 10.3 points, but Democrats narrowed margins in the elections since then. The other trio of counties to watch are the\u00a0WOW counties(Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington) in suburban Milwaukee. They've been the heart of the Republican Party in Wisconsin, but the counties were soft in their support for Mr. Trump four years ago, compared to other recent Republicans. The president won the WOW Counties by 28.3 points, down from Mitt Romney's 35-point win in 2012 and Scott Walker's 44+ point wins in 2010 and 2014. Walker saw his smallest margins in the WOW Counties in 2018 (+35.1 points), a sign Democrats have made some inroads.\u00a0Western Wisconsin\u00a0is home to many of the small cities, towns and villages where Mr. Trump cobbled together lots of votes en route to his statewide victory. There are more than a dozen counties along the Mississippi River and in the state's southwest corner that voted for Mr. Obama twice then Mr. Trump in 2016. Democrats won some of those areas back during the midterms and are hoping to cut into Mr. Trump's margins in the region this year. Of course, another major factor in determining the statewide winner will be turnout in Milwaukee. About 40,000 fewer people voted in the Democratic stronghold in 2016 compared to 2012. Today we will be watching to see if Democrats' record fundraising and spending on advertisements across the country can translate into flipping the Senate. Republicans currently hold the Senate with a 53-47 majority. Democrats would need to flip three seats if Joe Biden wins the White House and four seats if he doesn't, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Of the 35 seats up for reelection this cycle, 23 are held by Republicans and 12 are held by Democrats. The battlegrounds Democrats are hoping to flip include Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and North Carolina. Democrats have to defend Senator Doug Jones' seat in Alabama and Senator Gary Peters in Michigan. The record fundraising by Democratic candidates has expanded where Democrats are on the offense like in South Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Montana, and Texas. Election Day will show how far record-breaking fundraising numbers go towards winning an election. Another trend to watch is whether there is any ticket splitting between the Senate candidates and presidential candidates. The 2016 presidential election was the first presidential election in modern history where all of the states' Senate races went towards the same party as the presidential winner in that state. Can some of these strong recruits outperform the top of the ticket? It's worth looking at how GOP candidate John James fares in Michigan compared to President Trump and how Democratic Governor Steve Bullock does in his Senate race compared to Biden in Montana. Lastly, the control of the Senate could rest in the hands of Georgia where there are two Senate races this cycle. The rules in Georgia for both the regular Senate election and the Senate special election require a candidate to win a majority, and if none of the candidates clear the 50 percent threshold, the race goes to a runoff in January. Recent polling in the race between incumbent GOP Senator David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff has been tight, and the presence of a libertarian candidate on the ballot could prevent either Perdue or Ossoff from clearing the majority. In the special election, 21 candidates have qualified to be on the ballot including Democrat Raphael Warnock who has led in recent polls and GOP candidates Senator Kelly Loeffer who was appointed to the seat last year and Congressman Doug Collins. If no candidate clears the majority, that race will also go to a runoff in January. The expectation from strategists on both sides, campaigns and pundits is that Speaker Pelosi will retain her gavel and that the Democratic caucus will likely grow their majority by flipping anywhere between 5 to 15 Republican seats. Republicans need to see a net gain of 17 seats to flip the\u00a0House\u00a0and initially felt that impeachment (remember that?) would be their golden ticket to unseating so many of the moderate freshmen Democrats that ran on moderate profiles in 2018. But Democrat incumbent 'Frontliners' raised record amounts of money, as well as Democratic challengers, and the political environment for the GOP in the suburbs to Alaska seemed to worsen due to the President's handling of the pandemic. Republican outside groups and the NRCC are now having to play defense in just as many districts they were playing offense in, a big change from when they planned to funnel most of their resources into targeting 30 Democrats sitting in Trump-won districts.CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarrosays a high number of House races may not be called tonight. In 2018, 18 House races weren't called on election night and with the influx of mail/absentee ballots this year, some campaigns in tight races (i.e. New York's 11th) are expecting a long count. STATE-OF-PLAY Eleven states have gubernatorial elections today, though only a handful are expected to be competitive reportsCBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. For all states, the pandemic has elevated the responsibility and importance of the governor. This has resulted in some initially targeted Republicans, such as Phil Scott in Vermont and Chris Sununu in New Hampshire, being taken a bit off the table due to their high approval ratings. The pandemic has also made some races more competitive due to criticism over their governor's handling of the pandemic, such as Missouri's race between GOP incumbent Mike Parson and Democratic State Auditor Nicole Galloway. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper\u00a0has seen acclaim from Democrats\u00a0due to his shutdowns and attempts to mitigate the virus. But the economic impact of those shutdowns have also been a targeted issue for his Republican opponent, Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest. Montana's open seat race between Democrat Lieutenant Governor Mike Cooney and Republican Congressman Greg Gianforte is the only pure \"Toss Up\" gubernatorial race this cycle. The state has a history of ticket splitting, voting for the Republican presidential candidate since 1996 but having a Democratic senator or governor since 2005.",

            "article_content": "Voting for many is burdensome. Americans wait in line for hours to vote. Celebrities urge followers to make a voting plan in order to accommodate the inconveniences of voting. How can it be made easier? Some, mostly Democrats and voting rights advocates, believe Election Day should be a holiday. But when\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0looked into the topic, voting experts urged that declaring Election Day a federal holiday wouldn't solve any of the frustrating problems we're seeing today. In fact, it might lead to further congestion at polling places. \"I'm not a fan,\" said Eddie Perez, an election administration and election technology expert at the Open Source Election Technology (OSET) Institute. He said it's more important to spread voting out over a period of days and methods. Concentrating voters into a single day risks congesting polling places, even more so than some already are. Early and at-home voting \"helps prevent bottlenecks for election administrators because it 'flattens the curve' for when ballots are cast by large numbers of voters,\" Perez said. Executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation & Research David Becker argues that increasing turnout is a nuanced problem that can't be fixed by declaring a holiday. Like Perez, Becker thinks giving voters more time and opportunity to vote is the best approach. \"We already know how to make voting convenient to voters -- that's by offering them options, like making an election season rather than election day,\" he said. \"And we actually have more options than ever before.\" With those options -- early in-person voting and more voter awareness on how to vote by mail -- voter turnout appears to be trending upward. By Monday evening, more than 62 million had already voted early across the country, closing in on half of 2016's total voter turnout. Election officials in various states have predicted historic levels of turnout in 2020, with a chance to reach the highest ever. Experts told CBS News that it's no coincidence this is occurring in a year when Americans have more time and more ways to vote than ever before. Election Day is already a holiday for state employees in more than a dozen states including Kentucky, Michigan, and New York. But none of those states have considerably high turnout compared to those where it isn't a holiday. And even if it were a federal holiday, that wouldn't ensure that all voting-age Americans would have the day off. Consider the pandemic, which has not given essential workers more time off. \"Election Day as a national holiday would mean things like perhaps reduced schedules for public transportation, schools being closed, hourly workers perhaps being incentivized to work more with time and a half. And so while it's very understandable that people are trying to find ways to make it more convenient for people to vote, it's very likely that Election Day as a national holiday would actually hurt the voters who most need more options,\" Becker said. Modern life operates around the clock. Americans are working all the time. So, focusing voting efforts to one day doesn't do enough to accommodate everyone, Becker argues. He thinks the increased options afforded by early and mail-in voting could be undermined by making Election Day a holiday, creating \"a solution in search of a problem.\" President Trump barnstormed Pennsylvania on Monday on a three-pronged rally tour built around predominantly White, conservative areas of the state necessary to drive up his turnout margins in the battleground state, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. The trip comes as Democrats have outpaced Republicans in returning absentee ballots, with more than three times the number of Democrats voting by mail to date, according to the U.S. Elections Project. Republicans are hopeful the tides will turn on Election Day, as more of their voters cast an in-person ballot. That wish extends to the top of the ticket. \"You know, Pennsylvania is known as a very late voting state,\" Mr. Trump told crowds gathered at his rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania. \"Very late voting. Like Election Day.\" Supporters cheered. \"Very unusual actually, but I understand it.\" On Monday, Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told reporters, \"Voting is a habitual exercise.\" He added, \"If you vote absentee, you vote absentee. If you vote at the polls, you vote at the polls.\" Pennsylvania voters lining up at today's rallies told CBS News they plan to cast a ballot in person. \"I still believe in old school voting in person,\" said Doug Fisher of Lititz. \"With everything we've been hearing about mail in ballots, I just feel better with old school voting.\" The construction worker knows Election Night in America will look and feel a little different this year after he casts his in-person vote. And, he concedes he is a \"little worried\" about the system of counting ballots. \"I remember last year, my kids were up late watching on the TV,\" Fisher said. \"I've been telling them it might not be that way this year.\" Karen Essick from nearby Berks County told CBS News, \"It's something different.\" \"With the record number of votes prior to Election Day. It's a lot that they're going to have to deal with.\" And Anita Rank remarked, \"If I can show up to Walmart, or I can show up to anything and use my mask, I can show up to vote.\" Monday marks the president's 11th visit to Pennsylvania in 2020. For their part, the Trump campaign announced an additional $6 million ad blitz to hit Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan this week. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign has flooded the airwaves, investing nearly $10 million on television ads in Pennsylvania this past week alone. Trump supporters have taken note. \"I'm worried because all you see is Biden ads,\" salesman Dennis Ashcroft of Lititz told CBS News before taking his temperature test ahead of Monday's rally in his hometown. \"I think the media is promoting Biden. They're putting a lot of money behind Biden.\" Vice President Mike Pence said Monday that he would be in Washington D.C. in case he is needed to cast a tie-breaking vote for the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. As the president of the senate, Pence would get the chance to cast a tie-breaking vote, but he did not say if he would president over the senate, regardless. On Sunday, while campaigning in Florida, Pence said he will be there in person and wouldn't miss it for the world. Since then, five of his close aides have tested positive for coronavirus, including his chief of staff, who is deemed a close contact. On Monday morning, members of the Senate Democratic Leadership called on Pence to \"abandon plans to preside\" over the confirmation vote. Senate Democrats argued it \"would be a clear violation\" of CDC guidance. Pence's office said the vice president and second lady Karen Pence tested negative for COVID Monday morning. Pence campaigned in Minnesota on Monday, where he told supporters that having a Republican majority in the senate has made a big difference as the administration looks to confirm a third justice to the Supreme Court. Pence also offered his prayers and wished a speedy recover to Minnesota Congressman Jason Lewis, who is running for senate. Lewis underwent emergency hernia surgery on Monday, and is expected to recover. During a stop at a field office in Chester, Pennsylvania, on Monday, Joe Biden criticized Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows for saying on CNN Sunday that we're not going to control the pandemic.\" Biden said, \"No caveats, just a deadly admission.\" The former VP added, \"He waved the white flag all the way back then. He wasn't doing much at all. Some people said I was being harsh. That I was being unfair. The White House is coming right out now and admitting what I said months ago was absolutely true.\" Biden also took questions on his campaign stops and said he's not \"overconfident about anything\" and that he'll be traveling to Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Florida and Iowa soon. On Pennsylvania, Biden said \"it's a matter of great deal\" for him to win the state, \"personally, as well as politically.\" He drew contrasts with Mr. Trump's campaign rallies, and said the \"reason why it looks like we're not traveling [is] we're not putting on super spreaders. We are doing what we're doing here. Everyone's wearing a mask and doing their best we can to be socially distanced.\" Biden also scolded Mr. Trump for looking to hold another public event after the Senate's confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. \"I don't blame him for celebrating, there's a lot of things we could be doing having massive crowds, but the fact is it's just not appropriate now,\" he said. He added that it shouldn't be a huge crowd, attendees should be wearing masks, be tested prior to the event and be socially distanced. Biden preempted the questions by talking about his energy policy, a frequent attacking point used by Republicans since last week's debate. \"Let me make it clear, I'm not shutting down oil fields. I'm not eliminating fracking. I'm investing in clean energy and we're going to make sure that we don't continue to subsidize the oil companies,\" he said. Congressman Ruben Gallego of Arizona said Monday that Biden's campaign is \"ahead of schedule\" in turning out Latino voters in Arizona, a key demographic in the battleground state that Democrats hope will fuel a victory there come November 3rd, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. As a share of eligible voters, only Texas (30%) of the battleground states has a larger slice of Latino voters than Arizona (24%). And boosted turnout among the state's sweeping Hispanic electorate is often cited as a key factor for wins by Arizona Democrats in 2018. The Trump campaign\u00a0for months has touted\u00a0its own outreach to Latino supporters across the Grand Canyon state, with both campaigns buoyed by bilingual organizers and millions in ad spending on Spanish-language advertising. The Biden campaign has poured nearly $3.9 million into Arizona's Hispanic broadcast television airwaves, according to Kantar/CMAG ad tracking data, more than any other state except Florida. The Trump campaign has spent more than $2.8 million on the airwaves targeting these Arizonans. But an overwhelming majority of Hispanic voters in Arizona have for months told\u00a0our CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0that they plan to back the former vice president. As in 2018, the main goal for Democrats and their allies remains the same: Increasing turnout in majority-Hispanic communities like Arizona's 7th Congressional District, represented by Gallego. So far, more than 60% of requested Democratic ballots have been returned in the district, according to early voting data compiled by local data firm\u00a0OH Predictive Insights, above Democrats' countywide return rate of 41%. \"This district, when it turns out, turns the state,\"\u00a0said Gallego. Billed as Mr. Trump's return to Southern Nevada this week, which would have been the president's third visit to the battleground state of the general election, the president's supporters will actually rally just over the state's border in Bullhead City, Arizona, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Unlike in Nevada, \"constitutionally protected activities\" are explicitly exempted from Arizona's COVID-19 restrictions. The\u00a0Las Vegas Review-Journal reported\u00a0that plans to host Mr. Trump's rally near Las Vegas had\u00a0been stymied\u00a0by the rules, though\u00a0a similar event\u00a0has been announced for this week in Northern Nevada with Pence. The vice president's event in Washoe County will occur the same afternoon as an \"emergency meeting\" with the area's health officials over \"increasing COVID-19 trends in the county.\" Also in Arizona, election officials in Maricopa County are addressing concerns raised over the weekend by a local data firm, after they raised the potential for \"Election Day complications\" in Arizona's most populous county. Citing an analysis of voter turnout and voting sites in Maricopa County, Data Orbital President George Khalaf\u00a0warned of\u00a0\"hours of long lines at some of the most populated locations and very little foot traffic at others.\" But spokesperson Megan Gilbertson downplayed concerns, citing booming early vote turnout and several reforms to elections in Maricopa County. Past cycles in the Phoenix area drew frustration over long lines and sites\u00a0turning away voters. \"With historic turnout, voters can expect to see some lines on Election Day. But our larger locations are designed to serve 1,500 - 2,200 voters,\" Gilbertson said\u00a0in an email, asked for comment on Data Orbital's post. \"If turnout exceeds our projections, we will have a poll worker assigned to provide voters with wait times and address for other Vote Centers in the area.\" After having been dealt a setback in court Friday after a Nevada judge rejected\u00a0their request to\u00a0force the battleground state's most populous county to pause counting early ballots, the Trump campaign and Nevada Republicans have turned their pleas to Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports that in a letter released\u00a0over the weekend, the GOP urged Cegavske - the state's sole statewide elected Republican -to \"exercise your authority as Secretary of State to safeguard our election\" and block Clark County from \"any further signature verification of mail ballots unless and until\" their concerns are addressed. Democratic elected and party officials have repeatedly criticized recent GOP suits over rules governing poll observation and ballot counting as little more than efforts to undermine confidence in the elections, including over a filing\u00a0announced Monday\u00a0by Republicans in nearby New Mexico. \"We will always protect the right to vote, and we won't let it be suppressed,\" Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, said Friday\u00a0in a post\u00a0celebrating their court win. Clerks from northeast Wisconsin are asking the state Supreme Court to issue an order with instructions about how to handle an error on ballots that is causing them to not be read by tabulating machines, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The clerks in Outagamie and Calumet County said that about 13,500 ballots were sent to voters with a scratch in the timing mark, which is causing the problem. The error has been fixed on the rest of the ballots. The clerks said filling in ASthose scratch marks with black pen or marker would be the easiest solution. During a meeting last week, the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) endorsed that approach. Clerks need approval from the Wisconsin Supreme Court, though, in order to do that because state law requires defective ballots to be recreated by election officials. Clerks are worried that process may take too long and the WEC commissioners expressed concern last week that there could be errors in the duplicating process. NEW YORK A Siena College poll\u00a0released Sunday\u00a0found the race between Republican incumbent John Katko and Democrat Dana Balter in New York's 24th tied at 45% a piece, with Working Families Party candidate Steven Williams getting 5%.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports the two major party candidates had\u00a0their third and final debate Sunday night, as Balter tried to tie Katko to Mr. Trump in a district Hillary Clinton won by 4 points. \"As I've said, Donald Trump is the most dangerous and corrupt president of our lifetime and is making us less safe with every passing week... And it says a lot about the congressman's judgment that he chooses to endorse him,\" Balter said. Katko is one of only two Republican incumbents running for reelection in Clinton-won districts. He is portraying himself as the more moderate candidate and has often associated Balter with the \"far left.\" Katko said, \"I think I've earned the right for another term. For those who are undecided, keep in mind that I'll work with anybody, including President Biden if he makes it in.\" He added, \"We don't need someone from the far left in this district.\" When pressed about his January endorsement of Mr. Trump, Katko defended his support, saying he'd help prevent Medicare for All or a tax increase. \"It's not so much about President Trump and what he's done and hasn't done, and of course you factor that into the mix, it's about where we're going as a country,\" he said. Katko has\u00a0used Biden in past ads\u00a0to draw contrast with Balter. The same Siena College poll showed Biden leading Mr. Trump by 14 points, down from his 19-point lead in a September poll. POLLS Several polls released Monday showed incredibly tight margins for the most competitive House races this cycle, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.A poll by\u00a0NBC 4 New York/Marist\u00a0shows Republican State Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis up by 2 points with likely voters against freshman Democrat Max Rose. Rose holds a 1-point edge when it comes to registered voters. Both campaigns released statements about the poll, with Malliotakis' spokesperson Rob Ryan saying the gap \"confirms what our internal polling has been showing in recent weeks; this is an extremely tight race and Max Rose is in deep trouble.\" Meanwhile, Rose's campaign said the poll confirms the election is going to come down to turnout, and that internal data from the campaign shows high Democrat turnout and Malliotakis trailing Mr. Trump. \"Polls and pundits didn't think we could win in 2018 and we proved them all wrong. We look forward to doing so once again,\" said Rose spokesperson Jonas Edwards-Jenks. In Oklahoma's 5th, a poll by\u00a0Amber Integrated\u00a0shows Republican candidate Stephanie Bice up by 4 points against freshman Democrat Congresswoman Kendra Horn, 49% to 44%.\u00a0Previous\u00a0polls\u00a0have shown either Horn or Bice with a margin of error lead. Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans are optimistic after statewide polls in California and Texas. In California, where Republicans are looking to flip back several Orange County and Central Valley seats, a\u00a0poll by the Public Policy Institute of California\u00a0show Republicans with a two-point lead with likely voters in the state's competitive House districts. In Texas, a\u00a0New York Times/Siena College poll\u00a0showed Biden leading Mr. Trump by 5 points in 12 competitive and \"predominantly suburban\" House districts. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is specifically targeting ten seats in Texas, the most out of any state. Amid the state's spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths, Democrat Gubernatorial candidate Chris Peterson halted in-person campaigning on Monday. \"Politicians have failed to keep Utahans safe with their patchwork pandemic response, leading to overrun hospitals, uncertainty in our public schools, and shuttered businesses across the state,\" Peterson's campaign said. \"I hope that my opponent and other campaigns will join us in putting Utahans' health and safety first during this critical time.\" The Peterson campaign said they will still be campaigning online. A campaign spokesperson for Lieutenant Governor and Republican candidate Spencer Cox told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0they don't have any more in-person campaign events until election day, a decision made prior to Peterson. \"We have carefully followed state and local health guidelines, holding events outdoors and rigorously enforced mask requirements at our events. Given that the current cold weather makes outdoor events unpredictable, we will not be holding any additional in-person events,\" said campaign spokesperson Austin Cox. The race has been rated as \"Solid Republican\" by the Cook Political Report.",

Despite the record number of early voters, there will still be tens of millions voting on\u00a0Election\u00a0Day, and knowing the poll information in your state is crucial. Poll closing times vary by state. In some states with multiple time zones, polls can close first in the earlier time zones.

President Trump is planning to host an election night party inside the White House,\u00a0CBS News White House correspondent Ben Tracy\u00a0reports. Approximately 400 guests have been invited to the soiree, expected to take place on the State floor of the mansion, including the East Room. And while there will be other Trump-aligned parties around town - including at the Trump Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue - it remains to be seen if the president will drop in on election night.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports Mr. Trump will have\u00a0held 23 rallies in 10 states\u00a0during his last week on the campaign trail, a marathon schedule that hits on a slew of battleground states, offering what many campaign aides and advisors refer to as \"optionality\" in their path to secure 270 Electoral Votes. During his second of five rallies Monday, the president appeared upbeat and energized before a crowd of thousands in his Democratic opponent's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, but veered off message to sow doubts about the upcoming election results. \"Count the votes honestly, Governor. Count them honestly,\" Mr. Trump remarked, in an apparent warning to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf. At a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, the president bemoaned his impeachment, vented about his recent poll numbers, and railed against members of the media. \"You have the power to vote, so go out and vote unless you're going to vote for somebody other than me, in which case, sit it out,\" Mr. Trump remarked. The only mention of the coronavirus pandemic came in attacks on China and repeated calls for North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper to \"open up.\" According to Johns Hopkins University and Medicine, more than 9.2 million COVID-19 cases and 231,000 fatalities have been reported nationwide. At a late night rally at Miami's Opa-Locka Sunday, spanning into the wee hours of Monday morning, chants of \"Fire Fauci\" broke out after the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\u00a0volunteered a blunt assessment\u00a0of the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic. \"Don't tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election,\" Mr. Trump told jeering in an ominous forewarning to the nation's top doctor. But the president can only sideline or demote Fauci, a career government official who has served under six presidents. And while Trump campaign advisors boasted of a \"quiet confidence\" in previous days, GOP victories up and down the ticket will largely hinge on an influx of in-person voters, come Tuesday. Political operatives in Georgia and Arizona have expressed concerns to CBS News about changing tides in the traditionally red states, encumbered by tight Senate races and continued economic fallout amid a resurgence of coronavirus cases. Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence held two campaign events in Pennsylvania on Monday. In his last solo campaign event before Election Day, Pence gave the same speech he's been delivering for the last four months.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says Pence held at least 72 campaign events this year and 60 of those events took place between June 23, when the Trump campaign restarted rallies, and now. October was by far the busiest month of campaigning for Pence, who held 35 MAGA rallies. Monday afternoon's event in Erie, Pennsylvania, was the 11th campaign rally Pence has held in the Keystone State - the most of any battleground state he campaigned in this year. Outside of Pennsylvania, the vice president held nine events in Florida, eight in Wisconsin, seven in North Carolina, and six in Arizona. Pence also held five events in the states of Minnesota, Iowa and Ohio. He only held four campaign events in Michigan. While the vice president didn't hold any campaign events between late February and late June, he did travel extensively as the head of the Coronavirus Task Force during those months for official White House events. Many of those trips took him to important battleground states but the numbers included in this report only count campaign events. Pence's message has largely focused on the economy and under that umbrella he hits on manufacturing, tax cuts, and trade deals. Today, he said the choice for voters when it comes to the economy \"couldn't be more dramatic.\" In Erie, Pennsylvania, Pence said, \"Joe Biden spent eight years in the last administration trying to tax and spend and regulate and bail us back to a growing economy, presided over the slowest recovery in more than 80 years.\" He added, \"President Donald Trump, he created the greatest economy in American history, and he's doing it all over again.\" Pence claimed Biden will raise taxes and go back to a policy of \"economic surrender\" when it comes to trade negotiations with China. \"This is a choice between a Trump boom and a Biden depression,\" Pence said. He urged supporters to pose one question to friends, family, and co-workers that are still undecided. \"Look them right in the eye and say 'who do you really think can bring the American economy all the way back? Who do you really think can make 2021 a bigger year than ever in the history of this country?'\" Pence also touched on energy, saying that Biden will abolish fracking and cost Pennsylvania jobs. On COVID, Pence said Biden is going to shut down the country and force schools, places of worship, and small businesses to close their doors. \"Right at the moment that America is coming back, Joe Biden is talking about shutting it down. But we're not going to let it happen,\" Pence said. \"Under President Donald Trump we are going to defeat the virus and the best is yet to come.\" With one day to go until the election, Joe Biden began by barnstorming Ohio -- his third general election trip to the state -- and then made his 18th trip to Pennsylvania to campaign all day.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports Ohio is a late-breaking opportunity for the Biden campaign, a state not regularly seen within reach of Democratic candidates. Biden is ending his Monday evening where his campaign began last year: Pittsburgh, where he'll stump alongside Lady Gaga. Biden's campaign announced Monday that as polls open on Tuesday, Biden will continue campaigning in Scranton, and then Philadelphia, before finally heading to his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, where he is expected to address the nation late in the evening. Meanwhile, the top of the Biden campaign held a public briefing offering some of their behind-the-scenes thinking on early voting. This briefing was meant to pre-emptively combat any early claims of victory or fraud by Mr. Trump, according to campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon. She also made a notable prediction: \"We want to be fundamentally clear of what we believe to be true: under no scenario will Donald Trump be declared a victor on election night.\" Dillon added, \"When Donald Trump says ballots being counted after midnight should be invalidated - he's just making that up.\" Senator Kamala Harris spent Election Day eve making her final push to voters in Pennsylvania according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. \"This is Biden Country isn't it?\" Harris asked the crowd coming in 88 cars during a Latino Get Out The Vote drive in rally in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. \"In about 24 hours, Pennsylvania will determine who will be the next president of the United States.\" Other stops Harris stops included a canvass kick-off event at a local labor office in Pittston and stops at local businesses in North and West Philadelphia. Harris will end the day joined by her husband Doug Emhoff and musician John Legend for their election night eve drive-in rally outside of Citizens Bank Park. Earlier in the day, Harris was asked by\u00a0Perry\u00a0about any potential contingency plans the Biden-Harris campaign might have if the president challenges the results in Pennsylvania. \"The plan is, for the next I don't know how many hours we have left, to remind everyone of what's at stake and to make sure that everyone votes.\" Harris said. \"That's why I am here in Pennsylvania.\" As a share of eligible voters\u00a0in each of the battleground states, nowhere do Asian Americans make up a larger slice than in Nevada. And in the state, few places will these voters exercise greater influence over the Election Day outcome than in the state's 3rd congressional district, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Spanning an area encompassing much of Southern Nevada, from some of the Las Vegas Valley's priciest subdivisions on down to rural desert towns bordering California and Arizona, Nevada's 3rd Congressional District has played host to one of the state's fiercest House battles this year. Voters in Nevada's 3rd backed Mr. Trump in 2016 by only a single point even as they also narrowly sent a Democrat to represent them in the U.S. House. And the partisan makeup of this district\u00a0this year\u00a0remains nearly identical\u00a0to 2016: 36% of registered voters are Democrats as of the latest figures from Nevada's 3rd, 3 points ahead of the GOP. Now Democratic incumbent Congresswoman Susie Lee faces a stiff challenge from former wrestler Dan Rodimer, who has painted himself as a key ally of Mr. Trump and the election as a referendum on control of the House by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The outcome in this race could hinge in large part on Democrats shoring up turnout among a unique constituency in this slice of Southern Nevada: the Asian American community, which makes up\u00a014% of the district's population. State Democrats this year have touted everything from phone banking in Tagalog, spoken by the area's booming Filipino American population, to incorporating the language into their \"voter protection hotline\" as part of their efforts to court these voters. \"We know the power and the growth the AAPI community has here. Since 2000, the Nevada AAPI community has grown 167%,\" the Democrat said at a Biden campaign event\u00a0last month. More than 86 state chambers have elections on Tuesday, though results in just a handful states could be crucial for the next decade of Congressional and State Legislature district lines, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Republicans cleaned up shop in the 2010 elections ahead of redistricting in 2011, flipping 19 legislative chambers. In response, there's been an influx in Democrat groups getting involved with the down ballot races to avoid the same mistake. \"This moment is a decade in the making for us,\" Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee president Jessica Post said in an October press call. \"I witnessed firsthand how Republicans outworked Democrats in the fight for state legislatures.\" Democrats and Republicans are funneling money into the fight for control over the Texas State House, which Democrats are 9 seats away from flipping. The Republican State Leadership Committee say the Texas State House is a priority, putting $10 million into the state and raising close to $70 million overall. Democratic groups like the DLCC (which raised over $50 million this cycle) and Everytown for Gun Safety have also been active in the state, with the Democrat Forward Majority super PAC spending $12 million there. Due to its population increase in the past decade, Texas is expected to add congressional districts with redistricting in 2021. Democrat control of a state chamber would put them at the negotiating table for drawing district lines. Redistricting congressional seats is in the purview of state legislatures in 35 states. Like the top of the ticket, North Carolina and Florida are also battlegrounds for state legislatures. Democrats are six seats away from flipping the House in North Carolina, while their gap in Florida is a bit steeper, as they need to flip 14 seats to get the majority. In a memo released Tuesday, Forward Majority wrote that they've targeted 23 seats, including 15 Republican incumbents in districts where top-ticket Democrats won. Republicans are defending their majority in Pennsylvania's state chambers as well, with the House nine seats away from Democratic control and the Senate four seats away. Democrats controlling either chamber would be big for Democrat Governor Tom Wolf, who has often butted heads with the GOP led legislature in his first two years. The Cook Political Report has the Pennsylvania Statehouse and North Carolina's state Senate rated as a \"Toss Up.\" Other state legislative races to watch include Missouri's gubernatorial race, Michigan's Statehouse, Iowa's Statehouse, Minnesota's state Senate and Georgia's Statehouse. Committees from both parties are anticipating drawn out counts and potential recounts for tight state legislative races. The National Redistricting Foundation funded a-last minute federal lawsuit against Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, in which a\u00a0judge decided Sunday\u00a0that the postal service must continue following \"extraordinary measures\" to make sure mail ballots are delivered in time. During one of his final pitches to Florida voters, Mr. Trump held his 5th rally of the day in Opa Locka in Miami-Dade County at midnight Monday morning. Thousands gathered at the Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport and waited hours, jamming to tunes from a live band, before the president arrived. The president spoke for nearly an hour and even though Miami-Dade County has a\u00a0curfew\u00a0that goes into effect at midnight until 6 a.m. -- and despite Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez saying in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0earlier that the county confirmed the event would end before midnight -- the president didn't wrap his remarks until 12:48 a.m. Still, as the event continued into the night,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the energy from the throngs of supporters was matched only by the excitement of the supporters that started to gather as early as 5:30 p.m. -- hours before the program began. Demetrius Stroud, 39, said he's voting for Mr. Trump after supporting Barack Obama in 2008. Stroud said he doesn't feel like Obama fulfilled his promises to Black communities and was certain that Biden wouldn't either. \"Police brutality, Obama said he was going to handle it and he never did,\" said Stroud. \"He skipped around the subject and Biden say he's gonna handle it -- y'all were in office for eight years. It's still going on.\" Elsa Salvador, 67, lives in South Miami and was standing in line with family and friends when she spoke with CBS News. When asked whether she was concerned about the president's support among key voting blocs in the state, Salvador -- a self-described suburban Latina senior confidently said \"it's going to be a landslide.\" She continued, \"check back in with me on Tuesday night.\" In a press call, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon announced that 2,055,519 Minnesotans have requested an absentee or mail only ballot, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Of those ballots that have been requested, Simon said 1,716,575 ballots have been accepted, meaning that there are 338,944 outstanding absentee ballots. The secretary also weighed in the recent court ruling that required absentee ballots postmarked on or before Election Day and received within a week after Election Day to be segregated. For those segregated ballots to be invalidated, Simon said, \"For anyone to invalidate a ballot, they are going to be have to step up and pull the trigger. They are going to have to step up and ask the court to specifically invalidate certain ballots that are in that pile.\" Simon added that his office does not know if there will be post-election litigation, but he assumed that \"the wider the margin in the presidential race, either way, the less likelihood of litigation.\" In terms of reporting results, Simon said that his office does not plan to hold separate counts, but instead, have a \"rolling totally of validly cast votes.\" Simon added, \"The physical ballots will be segregated and the vote counts, but we are not going to be weighing, you know, separate vote tallies. It will be a running total through Tuesday, November 10.\" Nevada Republicans say\u00a0they are \"evaluating an expedited appeal\" to the battleground state's highest court after a lower court judge on Monday filed an opinion denying their joint plea with Mr. Trump's campaign to pause the counting of early ballots in Clark County, the state's most populous, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Democrats in the state have repeatedly decried the GOP's complaints around the county's handling of election observers and mail ballots, and Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford\u00a0in a statement\u00a0Monday denounced the case as part of \"the president's deliberate attempts to undermine Nevada's elections.\" In\u00a0his order\u00a0denying the Republicans' petition, Nevada District Judge James Wilson said \"the above-cited statutes created observers not counters, validators, or auditors. Allowing such access creates a host of problems.\" A federal judge in Houston ruled on Monday that nearly 127,000 votes cast at drive-thru voting sites in Harris County, home to Houston, remain valid. According to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News digital journalist Justin Hayter,\u00a0Judge Andrew Hanen threw out the case, saying the plaintiffs didn't have standing to bring the challenge. Judge Hanen also recommended people not cast votes at drive-thru voting facilities on Tuesday, saying the votes may not count because of Texas election laws regarding how polling places are set up. The Republican plaintiffs have filed an appeal to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and\u00a0Reuters reports\u00a0the GOP plans to appeal the Texas Supreme Court's decision on Sunday not to hear a challenge to the drive-thru votes. Republican activists and candidates have filed multiple challenges to Harris County's drive-thru voting in recent weeks. They argue that it's not explicitly allowed under Texas law and only certain people with accessibility issues can use curbside voting. The challengers said it's up to the Legislature to change the election code. The Harris County Clerk announced plans for drive-thru voting in the summer and it was used in a limited capacity during the July primary run-off elections. In a statement, Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said \"Texans who lawfully voted at drive through locations should have never had to fear that their votes wouldn't be counted and their voices wouldn't be heard. This lawsuit was shameful and it should have never seen the light of day.\" More than 1.4 million people have already voted in Harris County ahead of Election Day, which tops the county's total turnout from 2016. MINORITY VOTE More Latino and Asian American & Pacific Islander voters have already turned out in competitive House districts, according to data from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The Latino voting bloc is crucial in California's 21st, where freshman Democrat T.J. Cox beat Republican David Valadao by less than a thousand votes in 2018. More than 51.1% of the vote so far in the district is from the Latino community and 13,847 Latino voters there didn't vote in 2012, 2016 and 2018. In 2016, only 5,939 voted. Cox and Valadao had to wait weeks for a clear winner in 2018, with Valadao conceding on December 6 after all absentee and mail ballots were counted. California's 25th district (Los Angeles and Ventura County) has also seen a notable uptick in new Latino voters, as 11,485 of the committee's recorded voters there didn't vote in 2012, 2016 or 2018. In Georgia's 7th, which was decided by 433 votes in 2018, there are three-times more AAPI early voters than 2016 (over 30,000 compared to 9,500). Close to half of them, 43%, didn't vote in 2012, 2016 or 2018. In two Texas districts near Houston and Dallas, the AAPI early vote is already double the 2016 numbers. Like any other demographic, AAPI voters vary in their party affiliation. A\u00a0survey by Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote\u00a0found that 44% of respondents identify as Democrat, 28.5% as Republicans and 33% didn't know. Vietnamese respondents leaned the most Republican, with over 38% identifying with the GOP, 27% with Democrats and 34% as independent. This is a voting bloc to watch in California's Orange County seats in the 39th and the 48th district, which have heavy Vietnamese population centers such as Little Saigon. Those two districts are also seeing a huge influx of AAPI voters, with more than 57,000 combined early voters than 2016.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says the DCCC has been outpacing their Republican colleagues on non-English ads and outreach, spending seven-figures on direct mail and paid media in recent weeks. They've also been airing spots in Vietnamese, Korean, Hindi and multiple Chinese dialects this cycle, several firsts for the committee. APIA Vote director Christine Chen said while the uptick in new voters continues a trend of interest from the community in 2018, the pandemic has also shown a direct connection of politics to everyday life. \"In the past, we'd always have to put a lot of time and energy in convincing voters in our community that elected officials can impact their lives,\" she said. \"Everyone's tuning in every day to see, 'What is the COVID rate? Can my kids go to school? Can we open up our small businesses?' So they're making the connection that decisions being made, whether it's the federal level or local level, it impacts their lives.\" PUNDITS Political handicappers at the\u00a0Cook Political Report\u00a0are anticipating Democrats will not only retain their majority but could see a net gain of 10 to 15 seats.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that's a sentiment shared by House strategists with both parties, though the specific number of seats added is still up in the air. Republican groups involved with House races started the cycle on offense, but as the political environment has shifted to favor Democrats, they are left having to play defense on more districts than anticipated. \"Our goal is single-digit losses,\" said one Senior House Republican strategist. The Cook Political Report moved Republican held districts like Arkansas' 2nd and Texas' 10th to the \"Toss Up\" category, and overall have 18 Republican seats in the category (including Republican-turned-Libertarian Justin Amash's seat in Michigan's 3rd) compared to 9 Democrat seats. Republicans are still within striking distance for several incumbent freshmen Democrats, such as Kendra Horn in Oklahoma's 5th, Xochitl Torres Small in New Mexico 2nd, Max Rose in New York's 11th and Ben McAdams in Utah's 4th. Democrat Collin Peterson has represented Minnesota's 7th district since 1991, but is sitting in a district Mr. Trump won by more than 30 points and is among the likeliest Democrats to lose their seat. He is facing Republican Michelle Fischbach, the state's former Lieutenant Governor.",

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS \u2013 CHRISTOPHER KREBS MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, welcome back to Intelligence Matters, it is good to have you on the show again.\u00a0 CHRIS KREBS: Hey, Michael. Thanks for having me. Glad to be here. MICHAEL MORELL: So I'd love to start by having you remind our listeners, Chris, of the responsibilities of your agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA. Could you just give us a reminder on what you guys do? What are you responsible for? CHRIS KREBS: Yeah, so founded in November 2018, part of the Department of Homeland Security. Effectively, we're the nation's risk advisor. So we work with the private sector across a range of critical infrastructure sectors to address both cyber and physical risks and ultimately get the critical infrastructure of the United States in a much more resilient, hardened position. Of course, that includes a significant number of hot topics these days, including elections, but also helping secure the COVID response, the vaccine developers, the health care institutions, as well as working with any number of organizations as they move into the digital transformation, making sure that they've got the insight and guidance they need to do it in a secure way. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, a great transition, Chris, because, while I want to spend a good chunk of time talking about election security, I do want to ask a couple of questions about COVID. And maybe the first one is, how is your agency handling keeping your employees safe? They're obviously essential and they have to work. So are you on shift work or can they work from home or -- how are you guys handling that? CHRIS KREBS: So, I mean, that is the kind of the the question of the times, right? So we're actually 93% telework right now. About 2,500 employees, 93% telework. The majority of those folks that are working in an office environment are either in a SCIF, you know, a classified space or in an emergency operations center out across the 50 states. And yeah, we've had the kind of reduced footprint and have introduced social distancing measures for those that are in the office.\u00a0 But we've been actually pleasantly surprised with the productivity for those folks that are telework or adopting this kind of remote work approach. I know I myself get in the office about once a week or so and I've found honestly as productive, if not more productive than the pre-COVID, you know, the old normal. But for those folks that we do have in the office, again, social distancing or the PPE or at least cloth face coverings and disinfectants. But it's just, you know, being smart about the times and not rushing back into it, really enjoying the ability to free up the workforce a little bit, really try to understand what the post-COVID environment looks like and can we keep this sort of telework posture and maybe save the American taxpayer a few bucks in terms of real estate in leases for office space. MICHAEL MORELL: Have you been able to keep everybody safe so far? CHRIS KREBS: Yeah, we've of course had just the normal number of, I think COVID infections across the workforce. But I think across the board, we've been pretty fortunate in terms of a safe and healthy inhale team here at CISA. So, again, you know, looking to keep these best practices in place and following CDC guidance, of course, and following the lead of the various state and local health departments. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, you've issued guidance on how companies can help employees telework securely. Why did you take that step? Why did you do that? CHRIS KREBS: So it was pretty clear to me early on, you know, just even what we were doing as an organization, that a number of different -- whether it's a company or federal agency, was going through a pretty dramatic shift. There's a terrible joke that I tend to repeat, you know, \"Who was behind your digital transformation? Was it your CEO, your CTO or COVID?\" And what we're finding is a lot of organizations have tried to make this shift in the last couple of years, but competing business priorities and other organizational commitments had really hindered that tech transformation. But COVID, man, really snapped folks into action and they had to go to this remote operational environment.\u00a0 And that brings a whole lot of different security considerations, technology considerations. 'Do you have the appropriate tools in place, whether it's collaboration, how you patch your VPNs,' those things that we've been banging on for a number of years now. And so what we saw was a number of organizations, ourselves included, but also across the federal government, were issuing guidance. So we tried to pull everything together into a one stop shop. And the best place to go for that is CISA.gov/telework, where we pull together our own stuff. NSA, NIST and then private sector resources from the Global Cyber Alliance, Cyber Readiness Institute, even stuff from our international partners over in the UK, just really kind of pulls stuff together so that there's is one place to go to, whether it's, you know, the collaboration tools that folks are using, 'Here's how to deploy them in a secure way,' and providing not just the CIOs and the CISOs, but the executives, the C-suite, the boards, the general counsels things they need to keep in mind there, considering not just what today looks like, but, you know, the next year, two years. MICHAEL MORELL: So what are some of the key points that you think companies should think about as they work to secure all of this new telework and keep it keep it safe? CHRIS KREBS: Yeah, so it all goes back to what your vulnerability management approach looks like. How are you patching some of those critical appliances in virtual private network connections?That's -- we've seen the bad guys exploit it. We've issued some guidance over the last several months. Just VPNs are a target. What we're seeing in some cases is organizations are not only, you know, they're not patching, in fact, they're moving away from VPNs and just doing direct connections to the cloud.But also, how are you maintaining your your patch for your Windows machines, your Mac devices. And then multifactor authentication across the board. What can you do to really, truly harden the identity management posture of an organization? Again, best place to go get the CISA stuff is CISA.gov/telework. MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, you've also issued a joint advisory with the FBI that has formally accused Beijing of attempting to steal COVID-19 research and data. What can you tell us about that threat? Is it all about a vaccine or is it broader than that? How do you think about that? CHRIS KREBS: Well, you know, you come at it from the top and you're like, 'So China's conducting cyber espionage? Color me surprised.' These are things that I think we've all expected. In fact, we've been talking about it for months, it's the first real product we've put out. Predictably any foreign intelligence services would be get trying to get an understanding of what other countries are doing, what their response is, what their approach to therapeutics may be, and treatment going forward. You know, my concern here from a cyber security, resilience perspective is, these are sometimes organizations that are not Fortune 100, Fortune 500 with well-capitalized security teams and CIO and CISO shops. In some cases, they just don't have the same resources and therefore, any sort of intrusion could be disruptive to the overall effort. So this is much, much bigger than ransomware. This is destabilizing networks, and is focusing on, you know, from a confidentiality-integrity-availability triad perspective, the CIA triad, we're thinking -- I'm focused significantly on maintaining the availability and maintaining the integrity of the systems and the information that's running across those systems. MICHAEL MORELL: Is it just the Chinese or is it other governments as well? I don't know to what extent you can talk about it.\u00a0 CHRIS KREBS: Yeah. You know, if you're not doing it, you're not trying, kind of, at this point. We do expect every organ, every intelligence service to be in the mix here. The Chinese have obviously been one of the more brazen in terms of their approach. But others are in the game, too. This is a very active space, very active space. And that's kind of the thing about a pandemic, right? Is that it's not just one or two countries affected. It is truly a global event. So everybody is, every country is experiencing COVID in different ways, but they're all experiencing it. MICHAEL MORELL: And Chris, is it all about espionage? Is it all about stealing information or is there concern, is there any evidence that people are actually trying to do damage to the work that our research institutes are trying to do on the vaccine? CHRIS KREBS: So when you roll up all the different threat actors, both state and non-state actors, you get both the intelligence, the espionage piece, but you also get destructive attacks, absolutely. You know, the ransomware actors, you know, we kind of hoped against hope that there would be some honor among thieves. And what we found is even after some initial indications that crews like the Maze ransomware guys, said 'We're going to hold off.' What we found, after all, is that they did not. They were still exploiting the moment to go to get their ransoms. Those attacks are absolutely destructive. They absolutely take organizations offline. You know, when you think back to WannaCry when the National Health Service in the U.K. was disrupted, there were some significant impacts there. Now, this, again, is on a global scale. So you're seeing a situation where a hospital could be impacted and their network's offline, they can't conduct clinical operations. You can't -- it's not as easy as just transferring those patients to another hospital in this environment. You never know what you're transferring and indeed if you have anything you can transfer to. So we're absolutely seeing destructive attacks across the border right now. MICHAEL MORELL: So if anybody needs to any reason to be reminded of the importance of cyber security, it's the fact that somebody could actually, you know, hold us back in terms of getting a vaccine to deal with this pandemic. CHRIS KREBS: Yeah. And I think we've taken we've taken that approach previously for elections -- I'm sure we'll get into that. You know, sometimes when you talk to election officials or you talk to health care officials and you talk about Russia, you talk about China, we talk about North Korea and Iran, it doesn't always resonate with them. They may read about it. They may see it on the news, but they don't necessarily feel it. Ransomware, though, ransomware is something that they intimately feel, whether it's their community or their peer networks, They see ransomware attacks on a regular basis. And if you can address a number of the key ransomware vectors, then you can actually close out a lot of the threats from some of those state actors. So we've really put a lot of emphasis behind ransomware in a number of different sectors. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, maybe just one more question before we get to election security, and it's sort of a 50,000 foot question. So if you step back from COVID, where are we today in terms of the government's and the private sector's preparedness for dealing with cyber attacks? How do you think about how far we've come and how far we still need to go? How do you think about that question? CHRIS KREBS: So just today, we issued a series of products, a toolkit called Cyber Essentials Toolkit. It builds on a product we issued last fall. And really, the concept here is the CISO community has the IT security community has an overwhelming, you know, an abundance of guidance. They're good.\u00a0What we have to continue focusing in on are the people that make the decisions that enable the actions of the IT security community. And that's the C Suite, that's the boards of directors, that's the general counsels, the business side folks, underserved communities. So we're put a lot of focus on high-level executives of that community.\u00a0 Why is that important? Because it starts at the top. It's always about the leadership. The more leadership understands, the more they understand the business risk, which then leads to the investment community, the investment then leads to, you know, opening up the floodgates for the CISO community to make the right to get those investments in place for the capabilities. So I think back a couple of years ago to the RSA conference and the theme was \u2013 this was two years ago \u2013 the theme was 'Better.' And that was the kind of the feeling was like, 'Hey, things are better than they were a couple of years ago. Still a long way to go, but we're getting better.' It's the awareness that the leadership level is really opening up the investment channel so we can build out those capabilities. And I think across the board you see that. You see that there's more awareness of the need to take the right steps on cyber security. And I think COVID right now is just going to accelerate through the digital transformation, accelerate investment, cyber security capabilities. And, you know, there may be a market consolidation in the meantime, but so we're absolutely headed in the right direction on the defense side. MICHAEL MORELL: So election security. So how do you assess the threat landscape today as it pertains to foreign interference in the elections? How do you think about the threat that we are facing and are going to face as we get closer to November? CHRIS KREBS: Yeah. So I always like the framing of the Intelligence Community Assessment of 2017. They had three primary buckets. The first is the technical targeting of election infrastructure. The second is the hack and leak campaigns or activities focusing on the political organizations, trying to get sensitive information and some in some cases up oppo research. And the third is just the broader destabilising influence operations, trying to just undermine public confidence, create chaos. Those are absolutely three active areas, domains of activity by a range of actors \u2013 Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and others that are unattributed at this point. Everybody has their own different strategic objectives. I tend to think that we have put in place around that first area, that election infrastructure space, we put a number of security improvements in place, resilience improvements. We built these relationships across the country with the election officials, secretaries of state -- we work with pretty much every single one of them. We work with over 6,000 election jurisdictions. We have intrusion detection systems across all 50 states and their election systems right now. We have mechanisms to share threat intelligence. We do annual exercises. Everything is in place right now. Much, much better posture than we were in 2016. That's just because, you know, there was a Sputnik moment that we just woke up and said, 'Wow, you could destabilize a democracy through these sorts of efforts.' So I think we're in a much, much better position from a resilience perspective on the election infrastructure side.\u00a0Same goes, I think, with the hacking, the campaigns are more aware of it. There are ways on the private sector side where Microsoft, Google, a bunch of nonprofits got together, and they're offering and they've gotten from that Federal Election Commission some ability to provide services at low or no cost.\u00a0 And then on the disinfo aside, I think that's really the more complex aspect of this -- it's just psychological operations, psychological warfare. How are they getting in our heads, hacking our brains, we've said before, trying to get us to to lose confidence in our entire system, this American experiment. And we're not alone here. You know, you talk to our counterparts in Europe and throughout the throughout the world, this is the new normal. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, have we actually seen successful penetrations of campaigns or any related institutions or or just so far attempts? CHRIS KREBS: So in terms of that -- again breaking it up into the election infrastructure and then the campaigns, you know, this is one of those things where campaigns have always been on the radar for foreign intelligence services. This is just, you know, it's policy making, they want to be on the inside, they want to know what the campaigns are thinking, what the candidates are thinking, where they're going to go, so countries can start -- our adversaries in particular can understand what the next regime or administration might be thinking. That is active, active, active space. On the election side -- the infrastructure side, rather. Again, we've got a better understanding and visibility across the landscape. We see on a daily basis just normal automated scanning, bad guys trying to do bad things, taking advantage of, you know, being opportunistic, basically.\u00a0 But in terms of this sort of coordinated, orchestrated activity that we saw in '16 against, you know, the Illinois voter registration database, for instance, we haven't really seen, you know, something at scale. We have a better ability to see that. We put additional hardening in place. We've messaged very clearly over the last three and a half years about that sort of activity. So we think there's a good combination of deterrence by cost imposition and deterrence by denial in place that will continue to push off that sort of activity, but we're not taking that for granted. We are actively looking for it -- over there, our Intelligence Community partners are actively looking for it and we are actively monitoring systems here to stay ahead of it.\u00a0 But most importantly, we've got to make sure that resilience is in place, so even if something bad does happen, we got the paper backups, right. Voters know what to do, voters know that election night reporting is unofficial reporting. It takes time to get that final certified result. Again, it's just as much about building the resilience of the people that participate in the voting process as it is about hardening the election systems themselves. MICHAEL MORELL: So will all the states have permanent paper record for the 2020 vote? CHRIS KREBS: In the in the 2016 election, it was about 80 to 82 percent of votes cast in the country had a paper record associated with them. That's whether it's automatically generated or it's kind of a sidecar or it's a absentee ballot.\u00a0 By the time -- and I have not adjusted the numbers for some of the states that are shifting to absentee ballots or mail in voting because of COVID \u2013 but what we would expect is somewhere on the order of about 92 percent of votes cast will have that paper record associated with it. And that is a good chunk of the country. That's a good chunk of the competitive states as well from a policy or political side. There are absolutely some states that are going to be in a tough spot in terms of not having paper, and they have invested in additional security controls, monitoring and hardening their systems. New Jersey is the best example just yet -- they don't have the resources funding required right now to get there, but they have been investing in the cyber side. We work really closely with New Jersey on a number of things they're putting in place.\u00a0 So, again, significantly, dramatically better posture than we were. And, you know, on that note, one thing I'll add is that a lot of these systems that we're concerned about that, you know, that actual equipment you interface with on voting day, you might find in some states that they're out of the process, just because of COVID, because states are making shifts to vote by mail or absentee voting, so again, this COVID in some cases is actually cleaning up some of the lingering vulnerabilities in the system. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, did you all learn anything in particular from the Iowa caucus smartphone app incident? CHRIS KREBS: Oh, yeah. I mean, there are a bunch of things to take away here. I think first and foremost is just from a non-technical side, more of a kind of instant response side is, is, you know, whether you're a political party or a state organization, you've got to have an instant response plan. You have to know what you're going to tell the public, what you're going to tell the parties. You have to have a rapid response mechanism to get your arms around the problem and then clearly and confidently communicate to the public what's going on.\u00a0 The second piece is that unofficial voting or the unofficial results, rather -- We've got to reinforce that these official results, the certification of the vote, takes time. It's in many cases going to be weeks. It's not that night. So not jumping onto some of the issues that may pop up. But then also, you know, we've been kind of on board and we issued some guidance a couple of weeks ago that took a look at Internet-based voting, whether it's an app or whatever.\u00a0 We said, 'Look, there's a higher degree of risk here just because of the system you're using and the protocols that are supporting the process. We really would encourage you to have a physical ballot associated with the vote rather than, again, relying on the electrons. And I think that just is supported, again, by what we saw in Iowa. The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Mathematics had a report on this, a study a year and a half ago that just said 'Internet voting is not ready for prime time. Too many issues still remain in just the overarching security protocols.' MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, you talked earlier about the foreign focus from intelligence collection perspective on the campaigns. I'm sure the same is true of the RNC and DNC. How do they think about securing themselves? Is it a is it a top priority for them? Are they paying attention to it? Do they understand the vulnerabilities? Are you able to help them or not? How does all of that work? CHRIS KREBS: Yes. So we have been engaged with both the RNC and the DNC for a number of years now, predating, in fact, at least in my time here, predating the 2018 midterms. And, I found, really good uptake and partnership with us and transparency.\u00a0 We have seen them embrace cyber security and embrace protecting their systems. I think they again, like I said, with the some of the private sectors, technology solutions, provided we're given a break by the FEC that allows them to provide services. Because when you think about a campaign, if you've got a dollar to spend, anything spent on internal security is something that's gone away from from raising the campaign's profile. So the ability to provide those services at low or no cost is is it is a game changer. But again, RNC and DNC both have been all aboard. Campaigns have been all aboard. We've met with both the Trump and the Biden campaigns providing a range of offerings on our cyber services. MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, there's been a lot of discussion about the security of absentee and mai- in ballots. And I'm just wondering from the perspective of the kinds of things that CISA is paid to worry about, is there anything special with regard to mail in or absentee ballots? CHRIS KREBS: So I think what you've got to separate here is the systems from the process. The president's concerned about the process. From a systems perspective, we're looking at those infrastructure aspects that facilitate the execution of the process. And what I mean by that is what systems are are required to design a mail-in ballot to print it, to receive it, scan it. tabulate it. Those are things that we're focused on from a cyber security perspective.\u00a0 So, you know, early on in COVID \u2013 it's funny because, again, I come back to the RSA conference -- we were working with our state and local election officials back in early or mid to late February, thinking through, 'OK, how are we going to keep in-person voting safe and sanitized, and, you know, people that can come in and out?' And just things like, 'Do we have enough pencils, have disinfectant,' things like that.\u00a0 And then over time, we saw, as the pandemic grew, there was a shift om a number of states saying, 'You know what? Maybe we should not have people come in. We can use some of the other authorities that they have available to them.' And that's where we saw this move again towards mail-in ballots.\u00a0 But again, they didn't necessarily have the systems in place. And so they are rapidly acquiring the systems. We're providing guidance and recommendations on how to control that. But at the same time, we recognize that not everybody is going to be shifting to mail-in ballots, that, you know, that states still provide for in-person voting. So how do we provide them guidance on both these alternative approaches to voting -- which in many states are not the alternatives. You know, Oregon is 100 percent \u2013 almost 100 percent \u2013 mail-in. These are what we have to address, both the mail-in side as well as the the in-person side in this time of COVID. MICHAEL MORELL: Let me ask you kind of an unfair question here, but in terms of of everything that you're asked to do with regard to election security, do you have everything you need in terms of both the resources and the authorities to do your job? CHRIS KREBS: So, I mean, this is a good question on the authority side. One of the examples that I like to use is early in the administration, there was a conversation about shifting some of the Article one, Section Four requirements that the federal government takes a stronger hand in administering federal elections, in regulating certain aspects.\u00a0 Look, I'm a middle child, so I see compromise in coalition-building where I can. And I've always found that honey is going to get you the flies a little bit easier. And we spent a lot of time early on in the administration on building relationships. We had absolute missteps. We misfired right out of the gate. But I think we got feedback on this. We committed ourselves to election security and supporting our state and locals in and rather than taking an overly burdensome regulatory approach where we would have found ourselves in court like that, we said 'Let's work through this together. Tell us what the problems are. Tell us where we've screwed up. We haven't fixed this. We haven't provided the things you need.'\u00a0 And that's what got us to where we are today, where we're working with over 6,000 jurisdictions. We've got all 50 states as a member for that multi-state ISAC that shares threat intelligence that shares the best practices. We've got Albert sensors out there on all 50 states. Those are the things that I could point to as real significant progress and validation that we took the right approach.\u00a0 Now, resources. You know, I think Congress has always been pretty, pretty generous to us.But in some cases, there's just nothing better than good people out there putting their boots on the ground. I think in the run up to the 2018 election, I had over in the month of October running up I had about five hundred people across the organization that are engaged in election security. That's the same thing we're going to be doing in the run up to 2020. It's people, people, people. So really good people that understand how elections work in their state and how to talk to election officials and tailor solutions to their requirements. That's where I put a lot of the focus. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, you talked about that third bucket, right, that foreign disinformation bucket, via social media or different ways and how it relates to the election. Is that something that that you will play a role in or is that somebody else's responsibility? CHRIS KREBS: Michael, I'm disappointed in the question, because that means that you have not seen the War on Pineapple campaign that we launched last summer.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: I haven't! CHRIS KREBS: So. Yeah. So here's kind of how at least at CISA that we view the disinformation side of the problem. It's almost a supply and demand issue. So on the supply side, what we're seeing is other parts of the federal government, you know, between the intelligence community, law enforcement, some the Title 10 actors\u00a0 are actively out there trying to disrupt the supply of disinformation from our adversaries. But the companies are also involved in this. You've seen a number of inauthentic account activity disruption from the platforms.\u00a0 We're on the other side of that, we don't have those authorities, right. I'm the convener or I bring people together, we can help facilitate that by sharing information between state and locals, and the social medias when our state and local partners see disinfo activity they can share through us back to the platforms. We're focused on that -- on the other side, we're on the demand side. We're trying to to increase the awareness of this problem set. We have been working with state and local officials, election officials on the Trusted Info 2020 campaign, because that's what's going to happen when we run up to the 2020 election, voters need to know where they can go get authoritative information on how to vote in their state. What better place to go than the state senior election officials, secretary of state or the state election director. Trusted Info 20 20 is all about pointing people to those election officials to get info on where to vote, how to vote, and when to vote. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, you've been you've been great with your time. Let me just ask you one more question. We had Laurie Rosenberger from the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund on our show last week. I think you probably know her. She painted for us a picture of her nightmare scenario, which was, you know, many, many more mail-in ballots, absentee ballots, which could take us longer in getting to a winner, take us beyond election night to get a winner.\u00a0 And then you mix in with add some Russian tampering with election systems, not necessarily to do any damage or to change any counts, but just to sow confusion and distrust and then throw some Russian info ops on top of that in terms of, 'This is a failed election. Right. The Americans couldn't get this right. There was a high degree of fraud.' And, you know, all of that is a mix towards raising Americans' questions about how did the election go. And that has that has a kind of a feel of realism to me. And my question is not how do you prevent that from happening, my question is, how do we build resilience with American citizens not to fall for such a Russian kind of trap? How do you think about that? CHRIS KREBS: Yeah, I mean, look, the thing I think we we need to get our minds around is things have changed since '16. It's not just Russia. They've put the playbook out there. Any country that that doesn't quite like the way the American experience is going is going to get involved here or could get involved. But back to the, you know, increasing the resilience. I think\u00a0 there's two or three things we need to do .First is continue to point voters to that trusted information, as I just talked about, the Trusted Info 2020 campaign. You go to your state and local election officials, they're the ones that're going to tell you what the real deal is, when, where and how to vote. And then what the results are.\u00a0 The second piece is really reinforcing saying election night reporting is unofficial. And so it's on us to work with the media. And we did some some some tabletop exercises in the run up to 2018, we'll do it again for 2020. This is how things are going to work in the run-up to that November, that day in November.\u00a0 And then lastly, reinforcing that we take this seriously. We're protecting these networks. And this is an all of government -- this isn't just CISA out here all by ourselves, trying to protect these systems. You have the entirety of the federal government behind this effort here and working over there.\u00a0 So I've got great partners in the intelligence community with Anne Neuberger at NSA, General Nakasone and his team over at Cyber Command, the FBI. We've got the Election Assistance Commission that's helping get the funds out to our state and local partners. But this is something that that I've taken on as one of my top priorities, really, since day one, since I came into this job. And I'm not walking away from it. We're gonna be here and we're gonna we're going to fight through the end on this one. MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, thank you. Thank you so much for taking time out of your incredibly busy schedule. I really appreciate it. And so do my listeners. Thank you. CHRIS KREBS: Thanks. Great to be here.",

            "article_content": "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has delayed New Zealand's elections by four weeks due to the coronavirus outbreak in Auckland. The election had been scheduled for Sept. 19 but will now be held on Oct. 17. Opposition parties had sought a delay after the virus outbreak prompted the government last week to put Auckland under a two-week lockdown and halted election campaigning.   Before the latest outbreak, New Zealand had gone 102 days without any known community transmission of the virus, and life had returned to normal for most people, with restaurants and schools open and sports fans back in stadiums. The only known cases during that time were returning travelers who were quarantined at the border.  Officials believe the virus was reintroduced to New Zealand from abroad but haven't yet determined how. The outbreak in the nation's largest city has grown to 58 infections, all thought to be connected, giving health officials hope the virus isn't spreading beyond the cluster. Ardern had the option of delaying the election for up to about two months. She said she had called the leaders of all the political parties represented in the parliament to get their views before making her decision Monday.  \"Ultimately, I want to ensure we have a well-run election that gives all voters the best chance to receive all the information they need about parties and candidates, and delivers certainty for the future,\" Ardern said.   She said she wouldn't consider delaying the election again - no matter what was happening with any virus outbreaks.  \"COVID is continuing to disrupt life around the world,\" Ardern said. Other nations including South Korea and Singapore had nevertheless managed to hold elections during the pandemic, she added.  Ardern also announced that lawmakers would be called back to parliament, which had finished sitting ahead of the election. The parliament will now continue operating through early September.  Conservative opposition leader Judith Collins didn't offer much of an opinion on the delay, saying only that her National Party \"acknowledges the new date\" while also saying there had been testing failures at the border.   But the small opposition ACT party welcomed the delay. Leader David Seymour said the new outbreak had already forced him to cancel a dozen events, including debates and community meetings  \"In order to have a free and fair election, candidates need to be out in the community listening to voters, and that's not possible while Aucklanders are housebound,\" he said in a statement.  The delay will cause logistical problems, including rebooking voting venues and ensuring that the thousands of election workers needed for the poll are available on the new date. Ardern said she believed there was enough time to organize everything.  Opinion polling indicates Ardern's liberal Labour Party is favored to win a second term in office. The party's popularity has jumped significantly since the pandemic, with Ardern winning international praise for the way she's handled the crisis.",

Each week, users can listen to conversations between Morell and some of the world's leading intelligence and national security officials and experts. The podcast|, which launched in 2017, was previously produced in partnership with The Cipher Brief, a website dedicated to national security topics.  In this episode of Intelligence Matters, host Michael Morell speaks with Ursula Wilder, a clinical psychologist at the Central Intelligence Agency, about why intelligence agencies conduct psychological profiles of world leaders, and how past policymakers have used what they have learned to make strategic decisions. Wilder, who also worked in CIA's counterterrorism center and Medical and Psychological Assessments unit, explains the \"dark tetrad\" of personality -- narcissism, paranoia, Machiavellianism and sadism -- and how those traits can influence how leaders make decisions and engage in negotiations. She and Morell also discuss how policymakers respond to psychological profiles compiled by government agencies. 2023 Mar 29 |\u00a0CIA clinical psychologist Ursula Wilder on profiling world leaders

            "article_content": "New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern won a second term in office Saturday in an election landslide of historic proportions. With most votes counted, Ardern's liberal Labour Party was winning 49% of the vote compared to 27% for its main challenger, the conservative National Party.  Labour was on target to win an outright majority of the seats in Parliament, something that hasn't happened since New Zealand implemented a proportional voting system 24 years ago. Typically, parties must form alliances to govern, but this time Ardern and Labour can go it alone.  In a victory speech in front of hundreds of cheering supporters in Auckland, Ardern said her party had gotten more support from New Zealanders that at any time in at least 50 years.\u00a0 \"This has not been an ordinary election, and it's not an ordinary time,\" she said. \"It's been full of uncertainty and anxiety, and we set out to be an antidote to that.\"  Ardern promised not to take her new supporters for granted and to govern for all New Zealanders.   \"We are living in an increasingly polarized world, a place where, more and more, people have lost the ability to see one another's point of view,\" she said. \"I think in this election, New Zealanders have shown that this is not who we are.\"   A record number of voters cast early ballots in the two weeks leading up to the election.  On the campaign trail, Ardern was greeted like a rock star by people who crammed into malls and spilled onto streets to cheer her on and get selfies with her.  Her popularity soared earlier this year after she led a successful effort to stamp out the coronavirus. There is currently no community spread of the virus in the nation of 5 million and people are no longer required to wear masks or social distance.  Ardern, 40, won the top job after the 2017 election when Labour formed an alliance with two other parties. The following year, she became only the second world leader to give birth while in office.  She became a role model for working mothers around the world, many of whom saw her as a counterpoint to President Donald Trump. And she was praised for her handling of last year's attack on two Christchurch mosques, when a white supremacist gunned down 51 Muslim worshippers.  She moved quickly to pass new laws banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons.  In late March this year, when only about 100 people had tested positive for COVID-19, Ardern and her health officials put New Zealand into a strict lockdown with a motto of \"Go hard and go early.\" She shut the borders and outlined an ambitious goal of eliminating the virus entirely rather than just trying to control its spread.  With New Zealand having the advantage of being an isolated island nation, the strategy worked. The country eliminated community transmission for 102 days before a new cluster was discovered in August in Auckland. Ardern swiftly imposed a second lockdown in Auckland and the new outbreak faded away. The only new cases found recently have been among returning travelers, who are in quarantine.  The Auckland outbreak also prompted Ardern to postpone the election by a month and helped increase the early voter turnout.  The National Party's leader, Judith Collins, is a former lawyer. She served as a minister when National was in power and prides herself on a blunt, no-nonsense approach, a contrast to Ardern's empathetic style. Collins, 61, was promising sweeping tax cuts in response to the economic downturn caused by the virus.  In a speech to her supporters in Auckland, Collins said she'd called Ardern to congratulate her.   \"It is an outstanding result for the Labour Party,\" Collins said. \"It has been a tough campaign.\"   Collins promised that the party would be back to fight another day.  The election also saw Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters and his small New Zealand First party voted out. The libertarian ACT Party increased its support to 8% and the Green Party won 7.5% of the votes.  Labour Minister David Parker said it was a landslide win for his party. \"It's a tremendous accolade first and foremost to the prime minister, but also to the wider Labour team and the Labour movement,\" he said.   In the election, voters also had a say on two contentious social issues - whether to legalize marijuana and euthanasia. Polls taken before the election indicated the euthanasia referendum was likely to pass while the outcome of the marijuana vote remained uncertain. The results of both referendums will be announced Oct. 30. \u00a0",

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS: CLINT WATTS TRANSCRIPT PRODUCER: PAULINA SMOLINSKI MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0We wanted to focus on what foreign governments might be up to right now in terms of interfering with the election and what might be coming as we get closer to the election and then in the immediate aftermath of the election.\u00a0 Before we do that, I'd love to ask you two questions. The first is about your career. You've had an interesting career path.\u00a0 CLINT WATTS: I started off in the Army, and I was an infantry officer. I went to 1st Airborne Division, went over to Korea, and came back to Fort Lewis, Washington, where I was a company commander during 9/11. We all thought we were going to end up going to Afghanistan initially. Then bin Laden and Operation Anaconda went down. Bin Laden slipped across the border, and we all stood down. By a complete fluke in August 2001, I had dropped that three by five card into the mail to the FBI because I had a lot of friends that said, 'it takes three or four years to get into the FBI, you should do it.'\u00a0 A month after 9/11, October 2001, I got a call by a recruiter, and they wanted to know if I could take the test in two weeks. In less than a year, by the next summer, I was already at FBI Academy. In 2002, I switched out of command and went through Quantico. I ended up at the FBI in Portland, Oregon, where I was a new agent and worked on a case that was known as the Portland Seven. I was a brand-new agent and was very lucky and was very dissatisfied with the FBI. I really miss my colleagues back in the Army. I was watching Iraq go down. At the time, I was married to another Army officer, and I decided to leave the FBI in 2003 and went to grad school. In a complete weird twist and turn, I ended up at the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. Right across the river from where I am right now.\u00a0 I was at the Combating Terrorism Center, and we were doing a tracking of foreign fighters. At the time this was the start of the foreign fighter movement and we were watching foreign fighters on YouTube. A guy named Tom Harrington from the FBI walked in and was looking for trainers at the FBI Academy.\u00a0 I did an off the cuff briefing and he said, 'how did you know that?' I said, 'I was an FBI agent two years ago.' Rather than walk out, he was totally awesome to me. He was like, 'hey, would you work with us from here?' Over the next six to seven years, I worked for the FBI from the Combating Terrorism Center and U.S. Special Operations Command. By 2007, I was back working for Tom at FBI headquarters and worked on his staff there. He ultimately became the number three under Director Mueller and worked on intel reform. When I wasn't doing that, I ran projects in between there on short contracts tracking social media and terrorists. By 2012, it was the last time I was working in FBI headquarters on a contract. I came out and was doing cybersecurity research for a financial industry. On the side, we had this project which was tracking foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria on social media. That's how we found the Russians heading into the election in 2016 as they were posing as Americans in Syria around the Syria discussion. So it was a very weird route, but it's worked out somehow.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0My listeners should know that the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point is, I think, the leading think tank in the world on terrorism and counterterrorism. It is a really remarkable organization and group of people. People should go check out the website. It's a pretty special place.\u00a0 CLINT WATTS: It was such a great experience having come out of the FBI and grad school. We were doing declassification of all the stuff you were capturing overseas on these battlefields of al-Qaida documents. It was a great intersection between academia and the government, academia and the private sector or public sector. We were really able to do research both for the FBI and Special Operations Command. It was a great relationship, it was really one of the more remarkable times in my career, that three-year period when I was based there.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0The second thing I want to ask you about is about your book published two years ago, Messing with the Enemy: Surviving in a Social Media World of Hackers, Terrorists, Russians, and Fake News. Why did you write it, and what are its main themes?\u00a0 CLINT WATTS: I actually pitched that book in 2015 after doing social media influence for about 10 years, and I had done a lot of it at the think tank, the Foreign Policy Research Institute. I had been publishing about the al-Qaida and ISIS split during that time. It was interesting. I had also done a paper for the Center for the Study of Intelligence at the CIA and had gotten it published there. You could see this idea of social media influence really coming together from al-Qaida to ISIS, but also the Arab Spring on the other side. That's how we were tapping into the Russians over time. All of these social movements were clustering. And the rules of the wisdom of the crowd weren't holding anymore. I felt as if crowds were getting dumber almost by the day as they conglomerated. They became these conglomerations in different countries. We were doing a lot of survey work in different places, trying to assess al-Qaida and ISIS.\u00a0 I wanted to write a book that showed how the Internet was changing and how it was affecting us in the United States. I was lucky enough after I testified that I got a publisher who was interested in it. I wanted to show how the phenomenon of terrorists like al-Qaida and ISIS related to disinformation with Russia and then how it plays into our politics. I actually wrote a fiction chapter for that book, which is on Medium because my publishers informed me you can't write a fiction chapter in the middle of a non-fiction book. But it was basically about election 2020, which was what happens when everybody is pursuing disinformation, is pursuing some sort of duping of people, trying to herd people in weird ways that they don't understand. It feels like the Qanon moment is a great example of that at this point.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0The book was ahead of its time.\u00a0 On the 2020 election and foreign interference. The best place to start is with a quick review of 2016. What did the Russians do in 2016 and for what purpose? \u00a0 CLINT WATTS: 2016 is a great case study to see what lots of people are doing today. What the Russians do, which is brilliant, is called active measures, which is to win through the force of politics rather than the politics of force. This is to find people inside your adversary that are sympathetic to your view or unwittingly supporting your view, by that I mean the Russian view, and elevate them in political standing such that it creates chaos between the national security establishment governance system internally. You get people fighting each other and when they fight each other, they can't essentially face off against Russia. The other thing it does in the near term is it breaks up alliances. So as a way to break up the NATO alliance, the EU, if you can break these unions into smaller pieces, Russia one to one is much more capable and can overpower a lot of these entities. So how do you do that? You go after candidates and influencers with what's known as agents of influence. It's a confusing term oftentimes in the media. They are people with an outside voice in the target audience you're trying to influence who can sway people's perspectives on Russia.\u00a0 The way they went about it was unique. They tried to do this during the Cold War when they were the Soviet Union, but it didn't work. Because if you wanted to write a communist newspaper inside the United States, it would be very costly, very difficult to do, and really hard to build distribution for that. And you probably have an FBI agent chasing down those agents trying to facilitate this.\u00a0 But social media totally opens the door to this where Russia could set up in Russia and do influence inside the United States, not only at extremely low cost, but with almost no consequences. They could appear to look like and talk like Americans about American issues. There's really three layers to what the Russians did. First, they did the overt stuff, which we hear a lot about,\u00a0Russia Today, Sputnik News, this is state sponsored propaganda asserting their view. It's always interesting to hear people kick back 'well the U.S. does, too.' I was like, 'No, let's think about this.' This is a Russian news outlet about why America sucks that broadcasts into America. It doesn't talk to you about Russia. It's very, very different in its construct. The second part is to advance narratives into specific audience spaces. They created social media. They created websites that we call fringe websites. They created personas on Twitter and Facebook, primarily. On other platforms as well, but primarily those two. They were communicating, trying to look like and talk like Americans to try and convince them that this was a plausible position to have in the audience base. The third thing they did, which is really what separates them from everybody else, it was very devastating in 2016. They hacked specific targets with the intention of grabbing undisclosed information, dumping it into the media cycle, and powering it through the entire media ecosystem.\u00a0 This was the hacking of the DNC, the hacking of the DCCC, and the hacking of John Podesta, Colin Powell, General Breedlove, and several other key figures. There're four key themes in there. In the near term, it was to turn down Hillary Clinton. That was very clear by quarter 4 of 2015 that they were pursuing that. The next was to elevate Donald Trump. You could see that pick-up steam as he grew in his political power. The third thing was to assert that Bernie Sanders got a raw deal from the DNC and that was really the nuclear pay load of information that got dumped in the media system. The fourth part was to say, you still got to show up for Jill Stein. That was a very limited one. When you look at a very close election, every vote counts, and it was trying to turn down Democratic support. The last thing to think about is very important for 2020. In the 2016 campaign, the last thing they pushed for was election rigged voter fraud. By October, this time four years ago, they were really advancing the narrative that 'democracy was bankrupt. It couldn't be trusted. You can't trust elected officials.' That's what we're seeing even today and hearing echoed today with the long run goal of destroying American democracy or at least subverting it to such a degree that it's not a challenge to Russia.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0I want to talk about what we've seen so far in 2020. Last month, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence publicly called out Russia, China, and Iran as possible threats to the election. Just last week, in a joint press conference, the DNI and the director of the FBI called out Iran and Russia for specifically getting their hands on voter registration data and for Iran using that data to send emails to Democratic voters. Making those emails look like they came from a far-right wing group here in the U.S. Then there's been recent media reports saying that the Russians have been even more aggressive than the DNI implied in the press conference in terms of trying to get access to voting systems. Walk us through what you see foreign countries doing at this point. Who's doing what and for what purpose? \u00a0 CLINT WATTS: I'll use the same framework from 2016. If I was ranking on a scale of zero to 10. Russia is 10. Iran is 3. China is 2. In terms of election interference from our tracking in the last two years. So Russia is doing the overt trolling just like they did in 2016. They've been harsh and very negative on Biden going all the way back to the spring of 2019. Its very clear they don't want former Vice President Biden or Kamala Harris. She's a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee that was on the investigation of Russia. So they're not excited about that. On the social media and influence level, they have been pushing very hard in 2019 and 2020. Again, they are using troll farms, and this time even trying to set up a cutout in Ghana, which was to go after the African-American and minority communities in the United States. The good news on that front is social media companies have done way better this time around. The U.S. government has done much better. There's a lot of coordination and synchronization there, so a lot of that social media influence is still being attempted by Russia, but has also been repelled to a degree. \u00a0 The third part, which is still the question mark, is hacking and targeting. We know the alleged hack or attempted hack of Burisma related to the Ukrainian conspiracy that was coming out back in January. And then what we've seen over the summer, which is several different times Russia has been noted as trying to influence against former Vice President Biden through the Hunter Biden conspiracy with Burisma. That's everything from several different so-called leaks coming out of Ukraine by a guy named Derkach who was designated at the same point by the Treasury this time, which I thought was remarkable and significant, as a agent of Russia. The last part, which I think is super important, and we've heard reports this week that you mentioned that Russia is hacking at state and local databases, voter registrations, and possibly infrastructure. That's the last thing we're looking for that is an unknown. Would Russia try to interfere with the actual conduct of the election on Election Day? It's a remaining question. There are some troubling signs. But at the same point, I have to say the U.S. government feels like, at least on the NSA Cyber Command part, they seemed poised to do something. DHS and FBI have been working really well together. So let's hope that stays that way. \u00a0 Iran does the same thing. They follow the same playbook. But there's one huge difference. They have no bridge into the U.S. audience base. By that I mean, Russia is engaging at three levels. State to state, which is what we traditionally think of, but is really minor. Instead, they are engaging at the party and people level. They are trying to engage on a one to one level with people on the political polls that challenge the establishment of the Democratic Party. When you watch how they engage, if they wanted to send people to a rally, what Russia did in 2016, is they actually sent people to a rally. We had a pro and anti-Islam protest arranged from Russia by Russians occur in Texas. We had a man and a woman go to a Cheesecake Factory. The woman dressed up as Hillary Clinton and climbed in the cage there. That was all arranged by Russians. They have their tentacles into America. They have envoys they can lever.\u00a0 If you watch Iran, they're doing the same thing. They're hyper negative towards President Trump. They've been putting out social media accounts that often times get caught. At the hacking and influence level, we've seen they've tried to hack into the Trump organization. They've done sporadic attacks. It seems like somehow they acquired voting registration, which brings us to that incident this week. What Iran does different is they play to race and religious issues. It is the principle divide by which they try to engage Americans. Russia does that, too. But Russia also plays to socio-economic status, and they play on both sides of the aisle. When you watch Iran's content, that's why you could tell this was an Iranian operation this week, they play to racial issues. They want to stoke divides. They want to put President Trump in a very negative position by playing as if they were the Proud Boys sending that email. That's a way to provoke conflict in America that would naturally look like this is something empowered by President Trump in his comments going back a couple of weeks to that debate.\u00a0 The other thing that was very obvious right away is some of the servers that were used traced back to the Middle East, particularly Saudi. That's a classic cyber technique used by the Iranians that you could see. When we look at what the Iranians do, they actually have a weaker position, but they're more aggressive. They'll take chances that the Russians probably wouldn't do. 'Why pull off that incitement two weeks before the election?' 'Well it gets a rise in the public.' But Iran also has its own processes internally where they're trying to report up their chain saying, 'hey, look, boss, I've done something.' There's some internal pressures there as to try and go toe to toe with the Trump administration. The last part is China.\u00a0 China is really interesting to me because we could see in 2018 that the administration is basically saying 'China does it, too. They do it worse. They're trying to keep President Trump from being re-elected.' We really started tracking it significantly.\u00a0 Russia is the threat from now to Election Day for influence. But in 2021 and beyond, it's China. It doesn't matter who wins the election. In terms of election interference, we've been tracking China's overt propaganda. They speak remarkably little about the election. They are very negative towards President Trump. Not only do they talk a lot about foreign policy and less about elections, but it doesn't travel in the U.S. audience space. The whole idea of election interference is you've got to change votes. They're not putting out any content that Americans are grabbing that would change their perspective. However, around the world right now, China is really beating up on U.S. and advancing their vision of meritocracy over democracy, their vision of human rights versus the American vision of human rights, and maligning the U.S. about covid-19 response.\u00a0 We have been tied up in our own politics. We've kind of missed how China has really advanced abroad. They did a very Russian style election interference in Taiwan recently. They're also doing some of that in Australia. In the Pacific Rim, they look more like Russia, but vis-a -vis the U.S., they do not. Their social media accounts have been out there. They mentioned the election a little bit, but it's pretty spammy, and they get caught quite often. We have not seen them do hacking to influence. There have been reports from Microsoft that they tried to hack both the Biden campaign and the Trump organization to a degree. I took that to be cyber espionage. China over the horizon is really just waiting to see what the outcome is. They're making a very long-term plan to substitute out America globally with Chinese influence. It'll look a lot like Russia the closer you get to Beijing.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0You said the Russians are trying to push some themes out at African-Americans. What are those themes? What are they trying to tell them?\u00a0 CLINT WATTS: It's really double messaging. In one sense, they were quicker in 2020 to move towards election rigging and voter fraud claims around mail in ballots. They were very quick to that. Separately, they will push towards the U.S. and try to emphasize, 'hey the U.S. is not a good place for minorities.' Your rights are not respected. The political left, one of their outlets that is not well known but gets a lot of traction, is called Redfish. It is a social media influence platform based in Berlin, run by a lot of former RT employees. That pushes videos about the George Floyd protest. Native Americans inside the United States. We see them get millions of reposts and shares inside the U.S. audience space. That's really to malign the U.S. and pit Americans against each other. A key issue being blue lives matter versus black lives matter. It is used to polarize in a way that is on the political left, something that is very important to the political left, and pits them against the president. This is really interesting how this plays out, because it gives them a strategic lever over time if they can grow their audience base. That's where it has been remarkable to watch. We hear a lot about the Republican supporters of President Trump being duped going into 2016. This time around, we've seen them do really heavy targeting of the political left inside the United States. That's something I worry about over time that the younger audience doesn't have quite the understanding of how this comes through the social media influence space.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0You said you found it interesting and significant that Treasury was the one to designate a Ukrainian official involved in the Burisma information operation. Why is that?\u00a0 CLINT WATTS: It was interesting because we tend to see that out of the State Department with sanctions or designations. You will see them put forth those sanctions and this time it didn't. It came out of Treasury, which I took to mean that there's some sort of financial connection behind the scenes or some sort of influence of Russia in Ukraine with regards to that individual. The other part that I thought was remarkable is it shows that the whole government is engaged to a degree. I hadn't heard anything about election defense with respect to the Department of Treasury up until that point. What's been fascinating is without a grand NSC led plan for election defense, you've seen all the pieces sort of the institution sub-surface executing things to help defend the election.\u00a0 I don't know who would order those. I doubt from the White House level, somebody went to Secretary Mnuchin and said, 'hey, you need to make sure these designations come out.' I thought it was a very positive sign. It really shows that we're looking at lots of different ways to deal with malign influence around the world. That could be something going into next year. It's a really positive sign that the government institutions still perform their mission, are still moving no matter what the politics are at the upper levels.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0What are you most worried about between now and the election and then in the immediate aftermath of the election in terms of foreign interference? CLINT WATTS: For foreign interference, it's really the collision with domestic disinformation. Russia is the principal component. They've gone all in to support President Trump and would like to see a second term. They don't hide this. Vladimir Putin says this very overtly. He will express this. My concern is that we have such polarization at the moment, and we have such issues with domestic extremism, that if Russia were to choose to be very aggressive, they would help amplify calls for domestic mobilizations to polling place. Potentially showing up to challenge the authenticity of the vote. We've seen Russia do this in Montenegro, for example, with a trial that was conducted there and connected to the GRU on Election Day where they tried to seize a ballot box, basically. That's what I worry about, if Russia wants to go all the way, would they do something like that? The second part is on the digital side. Would they still try to hammer at an election or polling place or divulge voter registrations in order to confuse the public and sow doubt about the results and amplify, based on what we've seen, what is a morass of domestic disinformation that's already out there about whether or not the vote is going to be authentic. Then even beyond, I'm still concerned about Russia or Iran, to a degree, fomenting divides, continuing the election beyond if it's contested. Meaning if it's not an overwhelming victory for one candidate or the other, or if President Trump were to lose and he really contested and refuses to leave the White House, you'll see foreign manipulators move in very heavy. Russia will definitely be there instantaneously. They've probably already prepped their playbooks. But I think you would see the political left mobilization. You'd see Iran try and piggyback there. Although their reach is much less. It still adds to the pile of angst and polarization in the country.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0How do you think about how we best defend ourselves from foreign interference in our elections and in our democracy? What should we be doing about this or is this just something we're going to have to learn to live with?\u00a0 CLINT WATTS: That's a great point. It's something we'll have to learn to live with as long as political leaders who are elected officials don't unite behind the idea of stopping it. What's remarkable this time, the only node in the system that isn't really working well in terms of election defense is Capitol Hill and the White House this time. Despite all of our concerns, and I've been very harsh at times, social media companies have done pretty well. When they've gotten notifications, they've done takedowns.\u00a0 Now there's a debate about maybe with the New York Post story and Giuliani, that two weeks ago they took it down too quick without having sufficient evidence, even though they're trying to do election defense. That just shows that part of the system has gotten much better. Not perfect, but it's better. Also on the government side, it's remarkable to watch Director Wray, who is President Trump's appointee, going out with Chris Krebs of CISA at DHS that protects the election infrastructure, and General Nakasone. They are working essentially together. That's a positive sign for the public. One weakness is the legislation across the board. I testified four or five times now since 2017. Nothing has changed from the regulatory legislative angle.\u00a0 And legislation is still not there, which is why you get this confusion between Zuckerberg and Jack at Twitter and Facebook like, 'do we do political ads or not?' Because they will probably police whatever they're told to police and no one's told them what they should police. Separately, election integrity really comes down to will our elected officials and the candidates and campaigns take foreign interference and help. This time we've got several examples of where a Russian designated agent by Treasury is sending stuff straight to Capitol Hill. We see them tagging U.S. elected officials on Twitter. We see their social media content being amplified from the White House. That is troubling. We can't stop election interference unless the elected officials are on board with saying 'anything that we're doing is going to be American made and we're not going to take foreign assistance.' MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0On domestic terrorism, how serious a threat is it? Does it come from both the far-right and far-left or just one of those?\u00a0 CLINT WATTS: I was lucky enough when I was in Portland as brand-new agent, that we had domestic terrorism and international terrorism squads in the same office in a town that had flavors of both. In Portland this being the idea of Antifa. When I look at how it's shaken out, you could see this pendulum swing from international to domestic terrorism coming back to the states by about 2010 to 2012. By 2014 and 2015 I was already at terrorism conferences inside the U.S. working with law enforcement, and we were all more worried about domestic than international at that point. Sure, a lot of jurisdictions, particularly large cities, worried about the one or two ISIS recruits recruited remotely. But you could see this trend towards white supremacy picking up very, very heatedly. That was under the term of Barack Obama, an African-American man. You could see this picking up, this rhetoric. When that comes in and piles on with ideas of election rigging and voter fraud, for example. Or that you can't trust elected leaders and institutions, that really starts to overlap and blend in the anti-government space as well. Beyond that, we had a huge uptick in misogynist extremism with Incel, which is many of these cases over the last few years. And when you go to the social media space, they all overlap. It's very hard to parse them. When we worked on al-Qaida and ISIS, it was a network, they were recruiting, they were trying to grow and build. It was a command, both top down and bottom up. It has been fascinating to watch this grassroots connection of extremism that is not that different from the way ISIS formed. Meaning that if you were in the white supremacist extremist space now, a shooting in New Zealand that we saw at a mosque, one of the most tragic incidents out there, was amplified on to a white supremacist and other extremist groups platforms around the world almost instantaneously.\u00a0 The social media companies are trying to police it. You could see them go from ones and twos to forming into groups like Atomwaffen or the Base. When we talk about the Base now, it's remarkable that The Guardian reports that the leader of the base, while he's from New Jersey, resides in St. Petersburg, Russia. By and large, I would say right to left. Yes, there is some extremism on the left, but it's pretty isolated and it tends to not be the mass shooting or organized violence that we saw surfaced two weeks ago with the Wolverine Militia guys who were talking about kidnapping Governor Whitmer. Domestic extremism tends to peak in election years because tensions are high and hopes are up. This will be the big threat. If I had to put it on a scale, just like I did on Russia and on China. If it was international terrorism to domestic, I would say it's 3 to 10.\u00a0 10 for domestic right now. I've never seen it so high in my time working in this field. I would also say from political right to political left, it's a 9 or 10 on the political right and it's a 3 on the political left and isolated to certain extremes. The other part we should think about is how all these groups are coming together over time. They don't physically know each other. They are almost colliding from the political left to political right at different times.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0Does the FBI have the resources it needs to deal with this problem?\u00a0 CLINT WATTS: It is confusing to tell, partly because I feel like Director Wray can't be too open about the threat without colliding with the White House to a degree. I testified last year to the Senate. It was interesting. It was very hard to convince certain senators that the extremism on the political right was at the scale that it was and that we needed to start thinking about terrorist organization designation the way we did with ISIS and Al Qaida so that we can explore these leads on social media. Right now, domestic terrorism is still in the construct of one case at a time, and it's kind of up to agents to connect it together. Now, I know they've done some better organization. You can tell from the disruptions they've had in the last two years, they're doing way better on domestic terrorism. But I do worry that the resources aren't there to the same degree. Because we don't define it by groups very well, it really becomes this sort of 'does everybody know what's going on?' We don't have that situational awareness that, Michael, you and I would have had during the global war on terror. Where we were always trying to integrate and network with each other. It really comes down to personal relationships, I imagine, inside the FBI on how to handle this stuff. \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0International terrorism, this is obviously something you followed for much of your career. How do you assess the threat to U.S. interests today from groups like ISIS, al-Qaida, and other like-minded groups?\u00a0 CLINT WATTS: I'm worried I'm not paying enough attention to it. You're starting to see what we thought would happen as we withdraw from these battlefields. Syria and Iraq, are very similar to the 2010, 2011 period where organized militant groups are there. My question is, are they focused on the U.S. anymore? As we move back from these battlefields, are they still engaged to the same degree about provoking an attack? And that's where I don't know the answer and I'm unsure. I'm worried that we're trying to fight so many things on so many fronts simultaneously without a clear plan. Russia and election interference, China and a global state competition, domestic extremist at home. Cyber is its own battle space. We have switched. In 2016, if it was now, I still would have been on television talking about ISIS and we don't even mention it now. I am worried that we're slipping a little bit out of that space, but that could be as well just because I'm not paying enough attention personally. But I do have some concerns that I remember in the past two decades that when we take the pressure off these terrorist networks, they do regenerate. My question is, are they still focused on America as much as they were 10 years ago? That question I don't have a good answer to.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0What do you think is the greatest national security threat facing the United States?\u00a0 CLINT WATTS: The lack of unity inside America about what we believe, what we stand for, and what we'll fight for. It's remarkable. I've been approached a lot over the last few years about the question of 'how does America represent itself and fight in the information space?' And the question that I always arrive at is, 'what do we want to say to the world?' And that is not clear. I don't really know. It was clear to me during the war on terror, we're going to protect people, keep them safe, but we're also going to advance democracy and the principles of a free world, open Internet, those sorts of things. I can't say that's the case right now. I don't really know what the message is. I feel like America vis-a-vis China right now or in Europe with our partners. If we're battling Russia or if we're going up against international extremists, what will we say to them? What would we offer as a replacement? That's my biggest concern. In 2021, will we know who we are so that we can defend ourselves both at home and abroad?\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0I have exactly the same sense that the biggest threat to us at this moment is us. I worry a lot about that. Clint, thank you so much for joining us today. This has been a fascinating discussion. I've learned a lot, and I'm sure my listeners have learned a lot as well.\u00a0 CLINT WATTS: Thanks for having me. I am honored to be with my one of my heroes from the counterterrorism days. For everybody who is listening out there, everybody wanted to be Michael when we were young counterterrorism workers. I'm ecstatic to be on here today. And thanks for this opportunity.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: You're welcome. It's great to have you.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Bamako, Mali\u00a0\u2014 The Malian soldiers who forced President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita to resign in a coup promised early Wednesday to organize new elections after their takeover was swiftly condemned by the international community. In a statement carried overnight on state broadcaster ORTM, the mutinous soldiers who staged Tuesday's military coup identified themselves as the National Committee for the Salvation of the People led by Colonel Major Ismael Wagu\u00e9. \"With you, standing as one, we can restore this country to its former greatness,\" Wagu\u00e9 said, announcing that borders were closed and that a curfew was going into effect from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m The news of Keita's departure was met with jubilation by anti-government demonstrators in the capital, Bamako, and alarm by former colonial ruler France and other allies and foreign nations. The U.N. Security Council scheduled a closed meeting Wednesday afternoon to discuss the unfolding situation in Mali, where the U.N. has a 15,600-strong peacekeeping mission. Keita, who was democratically elected in a 2013 landslide and re-elected five years later, still had three years left in his term. But his popularity had plummeted, and demonstrators began taking to the streets calling for his ouster in June. West African regional bloc ECOWAS had sent mediators to try and negotiate a unity government but those talks fell apart when it became clear that the protesters would not accept less than Keita's resignation. On Tuesday, mutinous soldiers forced his hand by surrounding his residence and firing shots into the air. Keita and the prime minister were soon detained and hours later he appeared on state broadcaster ORTM. A banner across the bottom of the television screen referred to him as the \"outgoing president.\" \"I wish no blood to be shed to keep me in power,\" Keita said. \"I have decided to step down from office.\" He also announced that his government and the National Assembly would be dissolved, certain to further the country's turmoil amid an eight-year Islamic insurgency and the growing coronavirus pandemic. Keita, who tried to meet protesters' demands through a series of concessions, has enjoyed broad support from France and other Western allies. He also was believed to have widespread backing among high-ranking military officials, underscoring a divide between army leadership and unpredictable rank-and-file soldiers. Tuesday marked a repeat of the events leading up to the 2012 coup, which unleashed years of chaos in Mali when the ensuing power vacuum allowed Islamic extremists to seize control of northern towns. Ultimately a French-led military operation ousted the jihadists, but they merely regrouped and expanded their reach during Keita's presidency into central Mali. Keita's political downfall closely mirrors that of his predecessor: Amadou Toumani Toure was forced out of the presidency in 2012 after a series of punishing military defeats. That time, the attacks were carried out by ethnic Tuareg separatist rebels. This time, Mali's military has sometimes seemed powerless to stop extremists linked to al Qaeda and ISIS.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania in 2016 by less than 1%. To win in the upcoming election, he or the 2020 Democrat will need support from a crucial group of voters in the swing state: suburban women. Eight women across the political spectrum from suburbs outside of Philadelphia told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Anthony Mason what they thought about Mr. Trump, the Democratic candidates and issues like the economy and foreign policy. Here's what they had to say: Four of the women said they could not vote for Mr. Trump. One of them, Melinda Wolff, said she doesn't like to be labeled as either a Democrat or a Republican, but describing a candidate she would vote for, said, \"I want somebody I can look up to, somebody that has dignity, somebody that's not bullying.\" MaryEllen Digregorio, who flipped from voting Democrat to voting for Mr. Trump in 2016, said she doesn't \"see Trump as bullying.\" \"I see him challenging because the ridiculous that goes on sometimes,\" she said. \"I thought it was refreshing to find a businessman who made himself a millionaire want to work for me.\" \"I do have to ask, don't you think he's very thin-skinned?\" Cynthia Sabatini, an Independent who is registered as a Republican, asked Digregorio about Mr. Trump. \"Listen, my husband's thin-skinned and a whackadoodle, and I'm still with him 26 years,\" she said. Sabatini said she thinks a politician \"needs to be thicker skinned and not excoriate those who disagree with him.\" Julia Bohnenberger, a registered Republican who said she voted for Mr. Trump \"because he was the most qualified candidate,\" said part of Mr. Trump's appeal is that he \"punches back\" at people.  Past Republicans, she said, have \"failed because they've taken the high road and they've been buried by it.\" \"I'm not saying that this necessarily appeals to me, but I think Trump appeals to a lot of people because he punches back,\" she said.  Mary Lou Doyle, who plans to vote for Mr. Trump in the 2020 election, said the president \"isn't everyone's cup of tea, without a doubt.\" \"I don't like everything he says,\" she said. \"I don't need him to be like me. I need to be safe, and I need to be able to know that my economy for my friends, my family is solid.\" Charrele Robinson-Brown, a Democrat with \"some conservative ideals,\" was the only Democrat in the group who had chosen who she will vote for. She said she has picked former Vice President Joe Biden. Asked why, she said, \"Honestly, the lesser of the evils.\" \"He's got past experience,\" Digregorio pointed out. Wolff said she will vote for \"who can best beat Trump.\" Debbie Morse, a Democrat, agreed with Wolff. \"And I do think Biden's probably at the top of the list, but I'm still looking at the other candidates also.\" Nelly Jimenez, an Independent who said she will not vote for Mr. Trump, said she is concerned she'll have to vote \"for the less evil of the Democratic party or whoever else shows up.\" \u00a0 \"I am disappointed. I don't have choices. I don't feel that I have someone who's going to move me,\" she said. Sabatini argued Jimenez could write in a candidate instead. \"I did a write-in in 2016,\" she said. \"My family took issue with me that I was complicit in Trump's election \u2026 But it was a matter of conscience.\" Mr. Trump's \"international policy has been bold and effective in ways that we never anticipated. Getting rid of ISIS, getting rid of Soleimani, getting rid of al-Baghdadi,\" Bohnenberger said. \"I will tell you personally, I'm a Zionist,\" she added. \"For a president to so boldly stand for Israel is very important to me, and I'm a Christian, by the way.\" Bohnenberger also said strong borders were important to her.  Jimenez said she was concerned about the way people and children have been treated at the U.S.-Mexico border.  \"There is a lot of issues for me there about racial profiling,\" she said. \"The issue of the border is one that I can't forget or forgive.\" Robinson-Brown agreed. \"I think that Donald Trump is allowing people to make the decision to mistreat people at the border, to have racially charged marches,\" she said.  Robinson-Brown said she likes that Mr. Trump takes hard stances on some things, but, she said, \"he's not taking the hard stance on the racial issues, which are very close to me because I'm a black female.\" \"We need for him to take a hard line \u2026 and say, 'Hey listen, we don't act like that here,'\" she added. \"I like the fact that my portfolio looks pretty nice right now. I can make my taxes next year 'cause as time goes by cost of living does not match the cost of really living,\" Digregorio said. Sabatini questioned the tax cuts under Mr. Trump. \"Economic fairness is very important to me,\" she said. \"I'm not a Bernie Sanders supporter, I'm not an Elizabeth Warren supporter, but I believe that the Tax Act of 2017 was skewed in favor of the half of the 1%.\" \"And the corporations as well,\" added Doyle.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, halfway through this year's unconventional political conventions, the spotlight turns to the Republicans to make their case that President Trump deserves a second term. With the Democratic convention now a wrap, its message was loud and clear and far more negative than in years past. But in 2020, there is no business as usual.\u00a0JOE BIDEN: The current President has cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division.\u00a0PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that's what it takes for them to win.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The contrast will be stark. A new CBS News poll shows very different views from Republicans.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Make sure your vote gets counted. Make sure because the only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That kind of talk from Mister Trump has fueled a furious political battle over the Postal Service. We'll have the latest on efforts to ensure your vote gets counted. Plus, we'll hear what the GOP has planned this week from the head of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel. Biden national campaign co-chair and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti will also join us. And will the convention be overshadowed by the stunning arrest of former Trump White House aide in 2016 campaign strategist Steve Bannon. He's been charged with fraud in a fundraising scheme to build the President's border wall. This, as the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Russia pose a \"\u2026grave counterintelligence threat\" during the 2016 campaign. We'll talk with the former head of the FBI James Comey. We'll get the latest on the coronavirus from former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, then talk with the president of the University of Arizona Robert Robbins as some schools are forced to make dramatic changes in their COVID-era learning plans as students head back to school.\u00a0It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. With just ten weeks to go until Election Day, former Vice President Joe Biden has maintained his ten-point lead over President Trump following the Democratic convention. That's according to our CBS News Battleground Tracker. And there is yet another scandal facing the President on the eve of his convention, new audio recordings have surfaced of President Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry sharing some candid thoughts about her brother. CBS News has obtained those tapes and as of, yet, we have not independently verified their authenticity. White House correspondent Weijia Jiang reports.\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG (CBS News White House Correspondent/@weijia): Margaret, the recordings paint President Trump as a liar who does not read and even paid someone to take his SATs. This morning White House chief of staff Mark Meadows brushed off the statements on ABC saying just another day, and another attack.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MARY TRUMP: That existed--\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG: President Trump's niece, Mary Trump, who recently released a book criticizing her uncle, allegedly recorded conversation she had with her aunt in 2018 and 2019. Maryanne Trump Barry was a federal judge at the time and said her brother is, quote, \"cruel.\"\u00a0MARYANNE TRUMP BARRY: All he wants to do is appeal to his base, he has no principles, none, none. And his base, I mean, my God, if you are a religious person you want to help people, not do this.\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG: President Trump spent the week waging a personal war on mail-in voting.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This will be the greatest catastrophe, one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of our country. That's how serious it is. And they also think I'm trying to steal an election. Just the opposite: I want the fair results of an election.\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG: But Democrats are convinced the President is trying to control the outcome of the election by slashing resources to the U.S. Postal Service, which could cause balance to be delivered too late to count.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Don't pay any attention to what the President is saying, because it is all designed to suppress the vote.\u00a0MAN: The bill is passed.\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG: In a rare summer Saturday session, House lawmakers passed an emergency measure to send the Postal Service twenty-five billion dollars to help process ballots. Republican lawmakers agreed with President Trump.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE DREW FERGUSON (R-Georgia): This bill is a sham. We are piling up money we might as well put it on the national ball-- National Mall and have a bonfire.\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG: The bill would also reverse recent operational changes that resulted in nationwide mail delays, forcing the return of machines and mailboxes that were already removed. A new CBS News Battleground Tracker finds three-fourths of Republicans believe they are better off now than they were four years ago. Republicans also agree with Mister Trump's handling of the economy with sixty-seven percent saying it's in good condition.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0WEIJIA JIANG: President Trump plans to participate every night of the Republican National Convention, which kicks off tomorrow. Campaign officials say he will present a contrast the, quote, \"dim and dark view\" of the country that Democrats offered. And the President's chief of staff promises Americans will see a new side of the President. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Weijia, thank you.\u00a0We turn now to Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel. She joins us from Charlotte. Good morning to you.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL (Republican National Committee Chair/@GOPChairwoman): Good morning. Great to be with you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you're quite busy. The RNC nomination, formally, of President Trump is scheduled for tomorrow. Will he be in Charlotte at all? Can you tell us anything about what to expect?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, he will be in North Carolina, unlike Joe Biden, who didn't go to Wisconsin, the state where he held his convention. The President has an event planned in Asheville. He hasn't confirmed if he's going to come by Charlotte yet, but we have the delegates here.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The AP is reporting that the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, will be addressing the forum from Israel where he's on official business. This lineup, when you start hearing about cabinet members being involved-- I mean, first of all, it's very unusual for a diplomat to get involved in domestic politics. But this starts to look like using taxpayer-funded federal resources for a campaign. Will taxpayers be reimbursed?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: I can only tell you, Margaret, that the events that we've put forward from the RNC and the campaign are going to be paid for by the convention from-- from-- of the RNC and the campaign. You know, everything that we've put together has changed because of COVID. The President rightly said we're going to leave Jacksonville because we don't want to have resources taken away from a city that's dealing with a pandemic. And he brought it back to the White House, which is his residence.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: And it's being paid for by the Republican National Committee and the campaign, not the taxpayers.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you are confirming that Pompeo's trip will be reimbursed by the campaign?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: I-- I am not confirming anything having to do with Secretary Pompeo's trip. I am just saying the programming, the staging, everything that we're doing will be paid for by the Republican National Committee and the campaign.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You will have, as you said, some in-person activity there in Charlotte. I heard you have something like three hundred people gathering there for official business. How are you going to protect them all from COVID? This is a mass gathering.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: You know, Margaret, I think it's really important to understand that the Democrats and Joe Biden just said we're going to shut this country down again. And that is a really elite view of America right now. Now from a safety perspective, we tested everybody before they came to Charlotte. We have been testing people on site. We are doing the things that are allowing people to live their lives, have a convention and do it in a healthy and safe way--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: --which most Americans are doing going back to work because they're going to the grocery store, as they're going to hospitals. This is a realistic way of opening up our country and doing it in a health-- healthy and safe way. And the Democrats are saying, shut it all down. Well, that's easy for Hollywood celebrities and privileged politicians but that's not good for average Americans.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the election itself. The President has said he expects this to be one of the most fraudulent, if not the most fraudulent in history. He's against mail-in ballots, but the Republican Party in Iowa has mailed absentee ballots to voters. Politico is reporting Pennsylvania, the GOP website is promoting vote-by-mail, similar situation in Ohio. Why is the Republican Party promoting something that the President says he's against?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: I'm so glad you asked me this question because there is a very real difference between states that have tried and true absentee processes that have been in place and have been tested and work versus states like Nevada that ninety days out from an election have completely upended their entire election protocol and put chaos into their process because they haven't tested it and it isn't certain.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But the post office said this week--\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: And why are they doing that?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --that they can handle the mail volume-- volume. They don't have a problem.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: It's not about just the post office, Margaret. It's that they're sending ballots to unverified voter rolls. I just talked to a voter this week who said she's received three ballots for a different woman at her address, a person that's never lived there. These are the type of things--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: A ballot or an application for a ballot?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: An actual ballot. An actual ballot. She was in California. In Nevada and California, they aren't sending absentee request forms. They're sending live ballots, which I think is a huge problem. Getting an absentee request form--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be-- to be clear the Republican Party in these states is promoting mail-in voting. Is the Republican Party--\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: No. We are-- we are--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --supportive of that?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: --promoting people embracing the absentee processes that have been put in place, that are tried and true. And we are suing states that are trying to change their process ninety days out from an election, which is adding chaos to an election where we should have certainty.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of our data that we just got. CBS News has a Battleground Tracker out, and it's showing a big divide between how Republicans view the U.S. response to the coronavirus and how the majority of voters see it. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say it's going well. Thirty-eight percent of all voters say it's going well by comparison. Then fifty-seven percent of Republicans say the number of dead is acceptable at a hundred and seventy thousand people. Thirty-three percent of independents say it's acceptable, just ten percent of Democrats. How could that number be acceptable? And why is there such a big divide between how Republicans see it and how the majority of people do?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, I think that is a really unfair poll and-- and, of course, there is nobody in this country, there is nobody starting with the President of the United States who wants to see people pass away from this global pandemic that came here from China not being honest, from the WHO failing in their one duty, their one duty, to identify a pandemic. And they failed the global community. But let's be honest, Republicans do want-- do not want to see people suffering from this pandemic. We have all been affected by this. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. When you see Democrats continue--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you say that number is acceptable? You--\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: No, of course, not, Margaret. This is a global pandemic. Nobody wants to see somebody die from this. I have-- have had friends die from this. This is not something people want. But the President's response has saved lives by shutting down travel early, which Joe Biden called xenophobic, by doing the decisive actions he did earlier--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: From China, but not Europe.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: He did it from Europe as well, but Joe Biden didn't--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Not until March.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: But Joe Biden didn't support that. You didn't hear him come out and say we should shut down travel from Europe. You didn't hear Democrats saying that. They have opposed this President every step of the way. In a time of crisis when we should be coming together as Americans, this should not be politicized.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: One area where Republicans also differ from voters overall is on the Black Lives Matter movement. Most voters nationwide agree with the ideas of it, while most Republicans, two-thirds of them, strongly disagree. Eight in ten Republicans think there has been too much attention on the issue of discrimination. Doesn't this type of thinking hurt Republicans' chances of making gains with black voters?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, I think that there's a big distinction between the words Black Lives Matter and the movement, which has been led by people who embrace Marxism, who have said on networks, we want to burn this country down. And I think you have to separate that, because as we are seeing in the name of Black Lives Matter, these riots and these looters who really aren't affiliated with any type of peaceful protest, we all condemn what happened to George Floyd. Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think there has been too much attention on the issue of discrimination? That was eight in ten Republicans said too much attention on that issue. Not the movement, but the issue.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: You know who's given more attention to discrimination than anybody? This President. He's the one who passed the First Steps Act to get rid of the injustices in our criminal justice reform. This is our President who's pardoned people who were unjustly charged with crimes and sentenced to lengthy sentences disproportionately affecting the black community. This is the President who gave more loans to HBCUs. This is the President that created economic opportunity zones. This is the President who has tackled discrimination. And he's going to continue to do so. And you're going to hear more about that next week in our convention as he talks about the policies he's put forward and how they have improved the lives of everyday Americans.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Ronna McDaniel, thank you for your time.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: Thanks, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to national co-chair for the Biden campaign, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Good morning to you.\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI (Mayor of Los Angeles/@MayorOfLA/ National Co-Chair, Biden-Harris Campaign): Great to be with you, Margaret, thank you for having me.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on the issue of voting, because your state was specifically mentioned there by Ronna McDaniel as having increased mail-in ballots during the pandemic. During the March presidential primary more than a hundred thousand mail-in ballots were rejected by election officials, according to data that had been gathered by the AP. Given that experience doesn't that indicate that there are some significant gaps in terms of your state's election integrity?\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: A democracy is not an easy thing, Margaret, of course, but I have a very deep confidence in our secretary of state, Alex Padilla, in our counties, to be able to run elections and to run them well. And the difference is that we're trying to run elections that expand democracy, that give the vote to everybody where we see a war on voters in other states run by Republicans who literally want to take people off the ballot, take them off the election rolls, you know, a period here, a different-- a middle initial. We saw it happen with Stacey Abrams in Georgia. She would be governor today--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And Ronna McDaniel is saying you're adding people.\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: And it's kind of ironic that Republicans-- no, we are making sure that every American in California who can vote will vote. That is, I think, what a democracy is about. Why we make it so difficult for Americans to vote--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: --seems to be anti-democratic with a small D. And so we're going to make sure that we have not only safe and secure elections, but a paper trail as well, something I think all folks from both the right and left have called for, for years.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: I simply don't understand why this President fears this. It's probably because he knows he's going to lose.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: On the issue of the economy, that is one area where President Trump still seems to poll-- have better poll results than candidate Biden does in terms of perception of who would be better for it. Joe Biden said a lot of things in his address this week, but he gave virtually no detail on his economic plans and no detailed criticism of President Trump's either. Isn't that a mistake?\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: Mm-Hm. Well, I-- I know here's the-- the facts, Margaret, Democratic Presidents have added sixty million jobs to America, Republican ones, twenty-three million in the last few decades. You want to see the stock market do better, the GDP over-perform, that's always been under a Democratic President and not a Republican one. And we're very proud of the plans that we have to not only bring back jobs, manufacturing--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But isn't the slogan \"Build Back Better\"? Wouldn't you need to, if that's your slogan, explain how you're going to do it? Joe Biden mentioned the economy four times. Economic was a phrase used four times, mentions five million jobs, but didn't say how he was going to do it. Why not emphasize that?\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: We-- we have been talking until we're blue in the face about the most progressive and most expansive economic plan that we will see in our, I think in our lifetimes in America. Build Back Better has four different planks to it. One is to invest in infrastructure, in a new green energy economy and careers throughout America. Two is manufacturing back in America, unlike this President who said he'd bring jobs back but has been offshoring federal contracts to foreign companies since he has been President. We'll build back everywhere in America. And, third, the care economy. So many Americans-- and it's such a contrast in these campaigns, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris are about what we can do to care for one another, whether it's our kids right now in child care--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: --or whether it's our seniors in the end of their lifetime. And then something that's usually a peripheral issue, racial justice is a core part, the fourth pillar of that plan. So we have detailed that you go to President Trump's website, just like when he ran last time, there's two or three things on the economy and that's it. It was build a wall.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: It was get rid of immigrants. He has no plan. And he's killing Americans right now and killing our economy. I think it's such a contrast between two people who have a heart and experience--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: --what this country needs, and a man who has neither.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Killing Americans is-- is a strong phrase there. I'm going to ask you about what's happening with Covid-19 in your own city. You told CNN last month that it is becoming much more of a Latino disease. Why is it still such an issue that people of color in your city are disproportionately affected?\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: Well, a couple of statistics, what our lowest hospitalization rate since this has been recorded, we're at a positivity rate now that's about six percent. So we're really, I think, making huge progress and proud of that. But we're being left on our own. We're the first city in America to cut, I think, the African-American deaths, which were double throughout the country to under the population here. But for the Latino population, which I'm a part of and I come from, I think there's a couple of things. One is you had federal assistance that didn't go to many immigrants and to their families who could be married to or the child of an immigrant. And you didn't get the same money your fellow American citizens did. So they're being pushed to work more. They don't have access to the unemployment. They don't have as much of the kind of social network right now that we need. But we're making huge inroads, including in the Latino community right now. But this is something where you saw this President plant a seed when he ran for President, demonizing folks who are Latino, saying Mexican Americans were murderers and rapists and maybe there was a few good ones. This stuff has ramifications because it washes through a government--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: --that thinks it doesn't have to serve cities, doesn't have to serve Latinos. And we're seeing those numbers rise.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I want to talk about your management, though, in your city. You made an interesting choice this week. You actually shut off the power at a Hollywood home after they were hosting large parties there because it wasn't abiding by your regulations regarding the pandemic. How many other houses are you going to shut off the utilities at? Why aren't people listening to you?\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: People are listening, they're far and few between our numbers are coming down, but where people don't listen, we're going to shut them down. That's critically important. This is not a time to be spreading this disease, especially younger people. And, by the way, I want to thank all the young people who said shut it down because they saw their peers acting irresponsibly. At super spreader events ten percent of people, Margaret, usually are responsible for about eighty percent of the cases. And we're just not playing here.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0ERIC GARCETTI: We are not going to let people take our lives into their hands so they're shut down.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Garcetti, thank you for your time.\u00a0And FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute with former FBI Director James Comey. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back with former FBI Director James Comey. He used to be a registered Republican, but this week he will speak at the Convention on Founding Principles, which is a gathering of Republicans who are not happy with President Trump. Good morning to you.\u00a0JAMES COMEY (Former FBI Director/@Comey): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get your reaction and insight into what we learned this week, which was that the Southern District of New York indicted former Trump White House official and campaign strategist Steve Bannon for alleged fraud. He's now the sixth close Trump associate to be criminally charged by the DOJ. You used to run the SDNY. What do you make of this case?\u00a0JAMES COMEY: Well, it's another reminder of the kind of people this President surrounds himself with. At this point, they could almost start their own crime family. It's a very serious case. The Southern District of New York has laid it out in a very detailed indictment called a speaking indictment. And he's in a world of trouble.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: A world of trouble. What do you mean by that?\u00a0JAMES COMEY: Well, it's a very serious fraud case with a huge amount of money stolen from innocent victims, Americans who thought they were giving money to support the President's wall on the Mexican border and, instead, it was stolen. That will drive up the potential punishments for Mister Bannon and his co-conspirators. And, you know, he's in trouble because the indictment lays it out in such detail, including excerpts from texts. If you're Steve Bannon, you're his lawyers, you're reading this saying, I'm going down here. And I don't know what the next steps are for him and his co-defendants, but that's what I meant by world of trouble.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate Intelligence Committee, we know, also sent a letter to the Southern District asking them to investigate Bannon for lying to Congress. Is there more that the public leads-- needs to know about Steve Bannon and any links to election interference?\u00a0JAMES COMEY: I don't know. I don't know what the Southern District of New York is doing. I think this indictment surprised a lot of people because they did it like the pros they are. They didn't talk about it until they were ready to bring the case. But people can learn an awful lot about Russia and the Trump campaign just by reading the thousand pages that the Senate Intelligence Committee put out this week. It tells a story that blows up the President's nonsense about it being a hoax, that blows up Bill Barr's nonsense about there being nothing to investigate. There's a story there that the American people, if they're interested, can read and learn a whole lot about the kind of characters who were working with Russia during the 2016 campaign.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you more about that in a moment. We will have to take a break. But, very quickly, what do you see as the biggest threat to the rule of law right now?\u00a0JAMES COMEY: That even-handed law enforcement has disappeared from the Justice Department under Bill Barr and Donald Trump. It shouldn't matter whether Trump likes you or not. Everybody should get a fair shake. And that the truth is under attack--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0JAMES COMEY: --both by the attorney general and the President. Those things matter. That's why I'm speaking for the first time--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0JAMES COMEY: --ever at a political event this week.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We're going to take a break and come back and continue our conversation with former Director Comey in just a few minutes.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And this programming note, starting tomorrow night and running through Thursday, CBS will bring you coverage of the Republican National Convention led by CBS EVENING NEWS anchor Norah O'Donnell, along with our political team. Tune in. Beginning at 10 PM Eastern.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more from former FBI director James Comey and later the latest on the coronavirus from Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\u00a0We're continuing our conversation with former FBI Director James Comey. I want to pick up where we left off, which was that Senate Intelligence report. This is a bipartisan report, meaning Republicans signed off on it. This was three years long. And the conclusion here was that Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort represented a, quote, \"grave counterintelligence threat\" to the U.S. because of his close work with Russian intelligence officer Konstantin Kilimnik. This goes farther than what Mueller concluded and made public. Why? Why is the public just now hearing about it?\u00a0JAMES COMEY: Because the Senate Intelligence Committee was looking at all information they could gather. Mueller was approaching it as a prosecutor, trying to see what evidence he could bring into court to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt. And so the Senate Intelligence Committee could look much more broadly and, as you said, came to this conclusion that the head of Trump's campaign was funneling information to a Russian intelligence officer, someone he likely knew was a Russian intelligence officer. Let that sink in and then ask yourself, so there was nothing to investigate here, as Bill Barr says, it was a hoax? The Republicans have exploded that nonsense.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The report, though, also was critical of your old agency, the FBI. It said your bureau should have done more to alert DNC officials that Russian hackers had accessed their servers. Why didn't the FBI do this? This was a national security threat happening under the nose of the FBI.\u00a0JAMES COMEY: Yeah. That's-- I understand that. That's fair criticism. I think at the time, our folks thought that just telling an institution that the Russians are inside your house was enough. But I think part of what may have led to a lack of urgency at the DNC and at the FBI is that nobody anticipated this wasn't normal intelligence gathering by the Russians, this was an effort to weaponize. And if anybody had seen that, I think they would have yelled a little bit more loudly.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that a mistake on your part? I mean, how did the FBI miss that this was an active measures campaign by a foreign intelligence service?\u00a0JAMES COMEY: That's a great question. I think the simple answer is because it had never happened before, but if I were still director of the FBI, that wouldn't be a good enough answer. I hope they're taking a look back across the intelligence community and asking, so why didn't we imagine that the Russians might do this? But the truth is that we didn't. Nobody in the intelligence community did.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were FBI director, you never imagined this scenario. I mean don't you think this was a mistake on your part?\u00a0JAMES COMEY: I sure think it was a miss-- a-- a mistake, I'm not going to quibble on words. Yeah, it was a miss. I don't know why it didn't occur to us that the Russians were doing something that they had never done before, which is to weaponize and actually fire stolen material at our Democratic process. And, look, looking back in hindsight, it seems obvious. I don't know the answer as to why nobody in the intelligence community, none of the analysts, saw this coming. And it ought to be something that we're asking ourselves.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we still this vulnerable?\u00a0JAMES COMEY: Yes, in a different way. I'm sure the Russians will use different tactics because we figured out what they were last time. They achieved their objectives in the last election. They've done incredibly well under President Trump. They want him to stay in office. They'll be coming again. And the problem for us as Americans is you can't effectively stop a threat that the President won't even acknowledge exists. And so, sure, they're going to be in our house again, messing with us. The only way we're going to kick Putin out of our elections is to elect Joe Biden President so someone finally puts real pain on the Russians.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What does real pain look like? I mean we've been warned by the U.S. intelligence community that interference is happening again. President Trump is talking about election interference in very different terms. I actually want to play for you something that he said this week. He said that this will be the most fraudulent election in U.S. history. And he told this to Fox News.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (on phone): We're going to have everything. We're going to have sheriffs, and we're going to have law enforcement, and we're going to have, hopefully, U.S. attorneys, and we're going to have everybody and attorney generals.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: He's talking about fraud at the ballot box. He's talking about fraud in the mail. He's talking about fraud by receiving a ballot in the first place. What the President just described in that soundbite is, frankly, illegal in many states. It's up to local authorities when it comes to sending out local law enforcement, but he's making clear what he wants to see happen. What do you make of what he's laying out?\u00a0JAMES COMEY: Well, I'm sure the next question Fox News asked was, what are the facts that support your allegations of fraud? And there were crickets. I trust state, local and federal law enforcement to honor their oath to the rule of law and to not be part of suppressing votes. There's a legitimate role for law enforcement to play in connection with elections. And I'm confident that the men and women in law enforcement at all levels will abide by their oath.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: In other words, not do this. In terms of--\u00a0JAMES COMEY: Yeah. We-- this is-- this is America. We don't-- we don't-- at least we don't anymore, we did it a whole lot to African-Americans when I was a child, we don't anymore use cops to scare people away from polling places. We just don't do it. And I'm confident that police officers around this country are not interested in being part of an illegitimate effort like that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you the Justice Department is investigating the investigation into 2016. Do you know if you are a witness or a target or have you sat for an interview with John Durham as part of the investigation?\u00a0JAMES COMEY: Yeah, I have no idea. I've had no contact with him and haven't talked to him.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that that means you are a target?\u00a0JAMES COMEY: I can't imagine that I'm a target. I saw the news report that John Brennan-- Brennan was a witness. I-- given that I know what happened during 2016, which was a bunch of people trying to do the right thing consistent with the law, I'm not worried at all about that investigation of the investigation. Next, I'm sure will be an investigation of the investigation of the investigation. They just want to have an investigation to talk about.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a tweet you sent this week. You sent out a picture of yourself wearing a T-shirt that said, you know, more women should be elected, more votes for women. Of course, it is the-- the week honoring ratification of the 19th Amendment. But it drew this response that we just put up for our viewers from Hillary Clinton, who is just sort of making a smirk. I know she's said in the past that she thought she was on the verge of winning in 2016 until you reopened that e-mail investigation. Do you see this as contradictory? Do you regret what happened then? Because she, clearly, sees this as a contradiction for you to say now.\u00a0JAMES COMEY: Yeah. Look, I think it's pretty funny. And I get why she would send something like that. She's better at Twitter than I am. But I-- I regret only being involved in the 2016 election. We were stuck, and I think we made the right decisions choosing between terrible options. And so I wasn't trying, nor was anybody else in the FBI trying to elect or not elect anyone. And I hope more women get elected to office. I'm proud of that shirt that my daughters and my wife gave me. And I think it's time for more women to be leaders in this country. We'll all be better off.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we agree with you on that point. Thank you very much, Jim Comey, for your time.\u00a0We will be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus with CBS News national correspondent Mark Strassmann, who reports from Atlanta, Georgia.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News National Correspondent): At COVID University partying students have inflamed viral outbreaks, fuming administrators and campus anxiety.\u00a0BRIAN SALVATORE (Professor, LSU Shreveport): We also have a lot of older faculty and staff. And we're all vulnerable.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Dozens of schools already have reversed plans. They've switched undergraduates to all virtual classrooms, and offered a course in consequences. Syracuse suspended twenty-three partiers; Purdue, thirty-six; St. Olaf in Minnesota, seventeen; North Carolina State University has had multiple COVID clusters.\u00a0DR. RANDY WOODSON (Chancellor, NC State University): We've seen behaviors off-campus that, frankly, are inconsistent with our community standards and have-- have had an impact on our ability to go forward.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: But human nature's always the X factor, and fingers crossed is a poor COVID defense. Students have blamed administrators for poor planning. At Notre Dame, three hundred seventy-two people have tested positive. The student paper's front-page editorial \"Don't make us write obituaries.\" Across America, fewer people are dying from COVID. Death rates are down or flat in thirty-eight states and up in twelve. A month ago deaths were up in twenty-six states. But America's Heartland has more COVID troubles. Rising cases in twelve states, including North Dakota, Wyoming, Kansas, and Missouri. South Dakota's average daily case loads are up fifty-eight percent. Just one week ago, the state hosted a biker rally with a quarter million attendees.\u00a0CROWD (in unison): Let us play. Let us pray.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Feeling normal again is behind the push to play fall sports. In Division One college football's most competitive tier, there are one hundred thirty schools. Fifty-four programs so far have shut down this fall. But some schools required testing of all arriving students. COVID stampeded on campus anyway. And with this virus, getting it wrong in the first few weeks fuels a crisis.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Georgia's COVID case is improving. Like other southern states, it's been a hot spot for months. But now the Southeast faces another danger: A pair of tropical storms named Marco and Laura. They're both expected to strengthen into hurricanes, potentially complicating the region's efforts to bring the virus under control. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann in Atlanta, thank you.\u00a0We turn now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: New cases have dropped below fifty thousand for about the eighth day. That seems, according to Johns Hopkins, a positive development. But the CDC director says it's really middle America that's getting stuck. Where do you think we are?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, we're seeing some signs of good news here. We're seeing cases fall across the country, across the Sun Belt, where the epidemic was. We're seeing deaths start to fall, and I think we're going to see deaths fall below a thousand a day. They've been persistently at above a thousand a day now for almost four weeks. And we're seeing hospitalizations fall, which is probably the most important indicator to watch. They fell below forty thousand for the first time in a very long time. And this is being driven by declines in the Sun Belt where the coronavirus really was epidemic, the sort of second wave, if you will, of the epidemic, the first being located in the New York Tri-State region. But we're seeing more cases build in the Midwest and the West. And the concern is that if there is sort of a third wave, a third iteration of the national epidemic, it could be more diffuse spread across a broader section of the Midwest and the West, because cases are building in those parts of the country. And that's what's concerning people right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the things that the President has said regarding your old agency, the FDA. Yesterday, he posted a tweet that I want to show our viewers. He said \"The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. They're hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Most-- must focus on speed.\" It sounds like the President is directly accusing the FDA of political motivations. What is he talking about?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I'm not sure exactly what he's talking about, but I can tell you about my direct experience at the agency. I served in that agency three times, twice under President Bush and once as the commissioner for two years under President Trump. And when it comes to regulatory decision-making in that agency, it's a foundational truth that guides that agency as science and a deeply seated sense of public health mission that permeates that agency. It's a part of the esprit de corps of the staff of that agency. And I know that they know the urgency of the moment. They put out sixty guidance documents to find new ways to bring products to the market more quickly. There are seven hundred and fifty drugs under mid or late stages of clinical development, clinical trials right now. So I firmly reject the idea that they would slow walk anything or accelerate anything for that matter, based on any kind of political consideration and any consideration other than what's best for the public health and a real sense of mission to patients.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: As for the clinical trials they-- please.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the-- the chief of staff to the President doubled down on that today. He says sometimes you have to make them feel the heat if they do not see the light. He said a number of bureaucrats don't see the urgency. What urgency? What-- what-- what is the FDA being pressured to do?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I-- I think a lot of that was about plasma, that tweet, I think the President scoped into that tweet a comment on vaccines. But I will tell you and I sit on the board of Pfizer, one of the two U.S. companies furthest along and developing a vaccine, the vaccine trials have-- have enrolled very fast. Moderna and Pfizer, the two U.S. manufacturers who are the furthest ahead, enrolled twenty-five thousand patients into those trials in the four weeks that those trials have been stood up and they've really only been enrolling in earnest for three weeks. That's extraordinary. So to say that these products aren't moving at really historic pace I think is wrong. The-- there were delays or perceived delays in bringing plasma, authorizing plasma under an emergency use authorization, was reported this week that NIH had misgivings about FDA going forward with that authorization. But there's reasons people have some questions about that. The trial that that's going to be based on, seventy thousand patients, wasn't a very rigorously done trial. It was an open-label study where everyone got treated. So it's hard to draw conclusions. I believe plasma is probably beneficial. It's probably weakly beneficial in the setting of this treatment. But I think some people wanted to see more rigorous data to ground that decision. And I think that's part of what is going on here with respect to that tweet and questions about the FDA decision making.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: But I think the FDA is on firm ground taking their time to try to closely evaluate that information.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The Pre-- the White House has said there will be a major therapeutic breakthrough on the virus announced today. Do you know what that is?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I would guess it's the emergency use authorization for plasma. You know, the-- the issue here, though, is that patients are getting it. More than seventy thousand patients, again, have been dosed with that. So it's available. What the emergency use authorization will allow is probably more commercial distribution, and it will allow manufacturers of plasma products to more easily recoup the costs. Now, what plasma is is basically taking the antibodies from people who've recovered, so it's a blood product, and infusing them in people who are sick. And if you use it early enough in the course of the disease, there is some precedent for it being beneficial in the treatment of viruses. And so it is a good therapeutic to have in the overall armamentarium. But the bottom line is it's widely available right now, patients are getting it.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: The EUA, the emergency use authorization, will enable probably easier access in certain settings, but it's incremental, and you know, incremental gains--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --are important here, but we need to view it for what it is.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, before we let you go, I want to understand this study that came out this week showing from the Journal of Pediatrics that children have a more significant role in community spread than-- than believed initially. Does this mean kids are more contagious than we thought?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think this study was consistent with other studies. What it showed-- it was nasopharyngeal swabs, so it was swabs from children comparing them to swabs from adults. There was some problems with this study in that they were swabbing the kids early in the course of the disease, comparing them to adults who were swabbed late in the course of the disease, albeit adults who are very sick, who were hospitalized. And they found that the kids had very high viral levels, in many cases higher than the adults. I think it confirms what other-- other studies have shown, which is that children do shed virus and they can transmit the virus. If they can't transmit the virus, we wouldn't be seeing these outbreaks in day camps in Missouri and Georgia. We saw the situation in Ohio where there was an outbreak in a church service and children were in the chain of transmission. So children can transmit the virus. The presumption is that when they're asymptomatic, they're less likely to transmit it. And that's true of adults too. The CDC says that when adults are asymptomatic, they're also less likely to transmit the infection.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. Doctor Scott Gottlieb, always good to talk to you. Thank you for your time.\u00a0We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Tucson, where classes at the University of Arizona start tomorrow with four instructional options, including in-person learning. Joining us is university president and doctor, Robert Robbins. Good morning to you.\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS (University of Arizona President/@UArizonaPres): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. How many students are coming back for in-person, in-class instruction, and will all of them be tested?\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: So all of the students that are living in our dormitories are being tested, that's mandatory. We've tested over five thousand students with twenty-six positives, so it's about 0.3 percent. The other students that are living off-campus are being strongly encouraged to be tested. And in total, there'll be about five thousand students that will be taking essential courses face to face, in person. Those would be things like organic chemistry lab, physics lab, gross anatomy lab, those kind of things. And we think we're going to have about thirty thousand, twenty-eight to thirty thousand students coming back to the Tucson area. Normally, we would have forty-five thousand.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And your office told us that the only mandate for testing is for those living on campus. You just mentioned dorms there.\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Right. Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It looks like five thousand of your students live in dorms. That-- that means the majority don't live on campus. So-- so isn't this exposing everyone if you can't mandate testing for those who don't live in a dorm?\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Well, I think-- I think that what we're going to do is we will try to test everyone that comes on campus. What I would like, and, of course, what we would all like is a ten second-- ten-cent test that we could test everyone every day. We-- we think that we can test everybody who comes back to campus in person, but we can't test them every day using an antigen test, which is what we're using to look at our students that are coming into-- to the dorms. We-- we think that we've got a random testing protocol that we've got in place, but I would like to see us test at least once a week everybody who comes on campus face to face.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So Notre Dame mandated testing for students on campus. And I'm sure you know that they have had an outbreak\u2013\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --that has caused them to put things on hold for at least a few weeks. If they tried and failed, why do you think your university will be different?\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Well, I think that we've got extensive testing policies. I think they did the same thing that we did, which is test students when they came into the dorms, but I'm not sure if they were tested-- because they'd only been in class, just like at UNC Chapel Hill, they'd only been in class for a week or so. I think the big issue is off-campus activity.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: I think we all know that we can control things in the classroom and on campus and in the student union and not having large gatherings of people on campus in official venues. The problem is, what I've seen is that others such as Kansas, even Arizona State, other universities, Purdue, have gone aggressively off campus to try to break up large gatherings and parties. And that's where most of the transmission has occurred.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you expel a student if they violated one of your requests? I mean, how do you force people to behave in their own best interest--\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --when they're--\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Yeah. I--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --teenagers and in their early twenties?\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: Sure. No, I understand, and I think we're-- we're so to answer your question first, we've-- we've got a face-covering policy. We're anticipating there'll be some people who refuse to cover their face because of their expression of their individuality and freedom. But that is going to be-- that'll go through the dean of students and code of conduct. And, yes, they can be expelled. What-- what I think we're moving into is we-- we've done a very good job of testing, contact tracing. We've got COVID-19 Watch, which is a Google Apple app that uses Bluetooth. And we're the first university to use that. So, we feel good about our education. And we've been on with a weekly briefing every week and over social media. I think we're-- we're going to continue that preventative therapy and education.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: But we've got to switch quickly into the treatment mode.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When--\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: We know they're going to be spikes in cases, so we've got to be able to handle them.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, when do you hit the brakes? What's your threshold?\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: When we can't mitigate and handle, if we get overwhelmed with cases where we can't-- don't have enough room for isolation, our hospitals are starting to get capacity-- overcapacity where we can't surge into ICUs--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DR. ROBERT ROBBINS: --and if someone were to get really sick. So, we're going to be watching the numbers every day. And if we run out of isolation beds and we can't handle it and people are getting really ill, then-- then we'll pull the plug.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Robbins, thank you for your time.\u00a0We will be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to leave you today on an uplifting note. There is a new arrival here in Washington. Giant panda, Mei Xiang, gave birth to a new cub at the National Zoo on Friday. And the yet-to-be-named cub has been called a miracle, given how rare a panda pregnancy is, plus, the mother's advanced age. Proof that some of 2020 surprises can actually be good ones. And we need more of them.\u00a0That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Maine, Colorado, North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan Alabama: These are the biggest battleground states that Democrats and Republicans are targeting in the battle for control of the Senate in 2020. There are 35 seats up for election in 2020, and Democrats are hoping to crack the GOP's slim 53-47 majority in November.\u00a0 Republicans have to hold onto 23 to keep their 53-47 majority. Democrats need to pick up three seats to win control if a Democrat wins the White House, enabling a Democratic vice president to preside over the Senate. If President Trump wins reelection, then Democrats will need to pick up four seats to overcome a tie. Both parties are defending incumbents in two states the opposing party won in 2016, but Democrats, with just 12 seats to defend, have more bandwidth to go on offense in states that voted for Mr. Trump and have seen Democratic successes since 2016. Republicans came into this cycle already on defense but strong recruits and fundraising have expanded Democrats' potential beyond the initial two to three states on the front lines of the battle for control. Maine GOP Senator Susan Collins is facing a competitive reelection race for the first time as she battles for her fifth Senate term in a state Hillary Clinton won by almost three points in 2016. Collins' votes have been closely watched nationwide, especially after her crucial vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2018. And Democrats have an increased focus on the state because of the successes their party's candidates achieved during the 2018 midterms.\u00a0 Newcomer Jared Golden won the 2nd Congressional District, and Democrats won the state legislature for the first time since 2009. Collins' likely opponent in November will be state House Speaker Sara Gideon. Gideon will compete in the primary on July 14, which was postponed from June 9 due to the coronavirus. Collins' race is shaping up to be one of the most expensive elections on the map, even though Maine is one of the smaller states up for grabs and is not considered a top presidential battleground. During the first quarter of the year, Collins and Gideon spent around $9 million total, and each raised millions. Gideon raised more than $7 million in the first quarter, outraising Collins by almost $5 million. Collins has raised less money than Gideon since June 2019, but she finished the first three months of 2020 with her best haul this cycle so far and has $5.6 million cash on hand.\u00a0 In advertising, the race is one of the most expensive \u2014 along with North Carolina, Arizona and Iowa, according to data from CMAG/Kantar. The campaigns and outside groups have spent about $50 million combined in ad reservations this year. Collins' campaign has launched a series of ads highlighting her role in the passage of the coronavirus relief package, and Gideon's ads have focused on health care and what's missing in the relief package. Colorado Colorado and Maine are the only states with Republican senators up for reelection where Clinton won in 2016. Clinton won Colorado by almost five percentage points. Cory Gardner ran as a moderate candidate in 2014 and narrowly beat incumbent Democrat Mark Udall by about two percentage points.\u00a0 Since 2016, he has aligned himself more with Mr. Trump, even voting for the national emergency declaration on the southern border. That vote led to the Denver Post's editorial board withdrawal of its endorsement. Former Governor John Hickenlooper and former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff have qualified to be on the ballot for the Democratic primary on June 30. The Democratic field has gradually winnowed from at least 11 candidates to just two after Hickenlooper decided to jump in the race in August following his failed presidential bid. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee endorsed Hickenlooper the week he announced his Senate campaign, and Hickenlooper has raised more as a candidate for Senate than he did as a presidential candidate. In the first three months of 2020, Hickenlooper raised more than $4 million, and Gardner raised around $2.5 million. Gardner has the cash on hand advantage with a $9.6 million war chest. Romanoff has trailed the other two candidates in fundraising, bringing in under $500,000 in the first quarter.\u00a0Arizona In Arizona, Senator Martha McSally is competing in a special election against Democrat Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and the husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Kelly has outraised McSally significantly in every quarter since he jumped into the race in February 2019. In the most recent fundraising quarter, McSally raised over $6 million but still trailed Kelly's $11 million. Kelly now has nearly double the cash McSally has on hand at the end of the quarter with $19.7 million. McSally is fighting to win the seat Republican Governor Doug Ducey appointed her to in 2018 after John McCain's chosen successor, Jon Kyl, decided to step down. McSally lost the race for Arizona's other Senate seat in 2018 to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema by less than three points. This cycle, McSally will have more time to build support for the general election. In 2018, she faced an August primary fight against Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Kelli Ward then had to face Sinema in November. McSally has aligned herself closely with Mr. Trump and received his\u00a0Twitter endorsement early on in June 2019. She has raised her media presence during the coronavirus pandemic as an early critic of the World Health Organization over its monitoring of the virus' spread and her call for WHO director Dr. Tedros Adhanomto's resignation. McSally recently traveled with Mr. Trump aboard Air Force One to tour a mask-making operation in Phoenix. Democrats are eyeing Arizona in the presidential election, too. Mr. Trump won Arizona in 2016 by just 3.5 points, underperforming the 2012 Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, who won Arizona by almost 10 points against President Obama.\u00a0North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis is trying for his second term in a state Mr. Trump won by less than four points against Clinton in 2016. In November, he'll face veteran Cal Cunningham, who won the Democratic primary. Tillis' Republican challenger, Garland Tucker, withdrew from the race ahead of the filing deadline.\u00a0 With the general election set, because there is so much time between the March 3rd primary and the general election in November, this race is sure to be one of the most expensive Senate races in 2020. The race Tillis won against incumbent Democrat Kay Hagan in 2014 was the most expensive race in the country that cycle. This year, the two candidates and outside groups have already placed more than $87 million in ad reservations since the primary on Super Tuesday. The potential primary challenge against Tillis attracted attention because Trump supporters and moderates recalled his flip-flop on the national emergency declaration on the border wall in 2019. Tillis wrote a Washington Post op-ed criticizing the declaration and then ended up voting for it. At the president's rallies in the state last year, the crowd booed Tillis when he gave remarks ahead of the president in Greenville and Fayetteville. The heckling was less prominent at the president's March rally in Charlotte.\u00a0 During the pandemic, Tillis has supported the president's actions but\u00a0has also stood by the measures Democratic Governor Roy Cooper has taken in response to the virus. Tillis recently released a five figure digital ad campaign called \"Together We'll Win This\" highlighting the Senate's passage of the CARES Act, and his campaign this week put up an ad highlighting Tillis' working-class roots. Alabama Senator Doug Jones is the most vulnerable Democratic senator this cycle because he is running for reelection in a state Mr. Trump won by almost 30 points in 2016. Jones won the seat in a special election in 2017 against Republican candidate Roy Moore, who faced several accusations of inappropriate conduct with women. Despite the accusations against Moore and the flood of Democratic money supporting him, Jones beat Moore by less than 2 points. Moore put a campaign together for this cycle but did not garner enough support in the primary in March to advance to a runoff.\u00a0 Former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville and former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will compete in a runoff in July to take on Jones in November. The runoff was postponed from March 31 to July 14 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Trump has resoundingly rejected Sessions' candidacy and instead\u00a0endorsed Tuberville. The Trump campaign has sent a letter to the Sessions' campaign ordering it to stop claiming the support of the president.\u00a0 Over Memorial Day weekend, Mr. Trump and Sessions traded barbs on Twitter, with Mr. Trump posting that Sessions \"let our country down.\" Sessions responded with a rare rebuke, posting \"Your personal feelings don't dictate who Alabama picks as their senator, the people of Alabama do.\" Mr. Trump responded that Sessions \"had your chance and you blew it\" for recusing himself in the Russia investigation, to which Sessions responded he will \"never apologize for following the law and serving faithfully and with honor.\"\u00a0 Jones eked out a victory in 2017 in large part because of the support of African-Americans. At 28%, the percentage of blacks voting in Alabama equaled the percentage who turned out to vote in Mr. Obama's bid for re-election in 2012, and more than nine in 10 black voters chose Jones. In 2020, Jones has allied himself with his friend Joe Biden. Jones endorsed Biden the day Biden announced his campaign and told the Washington Post he expects Biden to campaign with him, as he did in 2017. Outside groups haven't made any investments in the race yet, but Jones himself has over $8 million cash on hand, significantly more than either of his two challengers, who combined have a $1.2 million war chest at the end of the first quarter. Michigan Democratic Senator Gary Peters is facing reelection in the coveted presidential battleground of Michigan. In 2016, Mr. Trump beat Clinton by under 0.3 percentage points, marking the first time since 1988 the state has voted for a Republican presidential candidate. In 2014, Peters won the seat over Terri Lynn Land by 13 points.\u00a0 In November, Peters will likely face army veteran and businessman John James, who ran against Senator Debbie Stabenow in 2018 and lost by 7 points. In his 2018 run, James said he supported President Trump 2,000%, and this cycle he has publicly supported the president, even though Politico reports\u00a0that at private events, he has voiced disagreement with Mr. Trump. James has outraised Peters since announcing in June last year.\u00a0 Peters has help from Democratic outside groups who have placed thousands of dollars in ad reservations in the state. Senate Majority Forward has placed almost $3 million in ad reservations through the end of the year, according to CMAG/Kantar data. The ads from the PAC focus on health care and tie James to the GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Peters' ads also focus on health care. The results of the presidential contest could determine who walks away with this seat. Senate seats in presidential election years tend to go to the party who wins at the top of ticket, and that trend escalated in 2016 when for the first time, every Senate seat went to the party that won the presidential spot in that state. Peters went into this cycle with low name recognition, and he'll either fight for or lap up attention because of Michigan's battleground status and the focus on the state during the coronavirus in part because of Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Other races Democrats have their eyes on are Iowa, Montana, South Carolina, Kansas and Georgia. In Montana and South Carolina, the Democrats have strong recruits in Governor Steve Bullock   and associate Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison who both have shown strong fundraising. In Iowa, Senator Joni Ernst has been declining in popularity as a result of the economic damage the state has suffered from the Trump administration's trade war and now, the coronavirus.\u00a0 In Kansas' open seat, Republicans are still picking a candidate out of a large field, while Democratic state Senator Barbara Bollier has emerged as the Democratic frontrunner and has posted solid fundraising.\u00a0 In Georgia, Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are facing elections. Perdue's race has received less attention than Loeffler's. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp ignored the will of many Trump allies when he appointed Loeffler to retiring Senator Johnny Isakson's seat in December instead of Representative Doug Collins, a Trump favorite. Loeffler faces Collins and several other candidates in a special election in November. There is no primary in this race. Another race worth watching is the Democratic primary on September 1 in Massachusetts,\u00a0between Senator Ed Markey and his challenger, Representative Joe Kennedy, a grandson of Robert F. Kennedy. \u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is up for reelection himself said in an interview on Fox News Radio that who wins the Senate majority this cycle is not a certainty. \"Look, I think it's, it's a tough fight,\" McConnell said. \"We don't have a lock on it, nor do they. It's going to be a fight to the finish or like a knife fight in an alley.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the Pentagon.",

            "article_content": "A week after\u00a0Iowa's caucus debacle, the nation\u00a0casts its first votes of the 2020 primary cycle Tuesday\u00a0in New Hampshire. After months of\u00a0shopping for the right candidate\u00a0at town halls and house parties, voters here will weigh in on the crowded Democratic field. New Hampshire is celebrating 100 years of holding the \"first in the nation\" primary this year, but it's not entirely clear how long the state will be able to hold on to that designation. In recent years, some in the Democratic Party have begun to complain that the state's lack of racial diversity makes it ill-suited to be the first vetters of the presidential candidates. The state has already taken some measures to protect its \"first in the nation\" status, passing legislation before the 1976 election that would prevent other states from preempting the state's primary election. \"The presidential primary election shall be held on the second Tuesday in March or on a date selected by the secretary of state which is seven days or more immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election,\" the law reads. The candidate next door\u00a0 Candidates from next door have historically over-performed in the New Hampshire primary compared with national outcomes, a point Joe Biden brought up on Friday as he tried to downplay expectations for a better performance here after the \"gut punch\" he acknowledged getting from his fourth-place finish in Iowa. With former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick's late entry into the race, there are three candidates from neighboring states campaigning in New Hampshire for the Democratic nomination. The others are front-runner Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. This year, they may have a slight advantage, with neighboring volunteer reinforcements, New England commonalities and a familiar media market. But that hasn't stopped Pete Buttigieg, of Indiana, and Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota from surging in polls over the past few days. Since 1952, when New Hampshire's modern primary began, there have been 17 Democratic races. Seven of those included candidates from the Granite State's three neighbors \u2014 Massachusetts, Maine or Vermont. In those races, New Hampshire's neighbors have won six times. Additionally, two other times candidates from neighboring states finished in second place. The Electorate New Hampshire's longtime secretary of state, Bill Gardner, has set his quadrennial 2020 primary turnout prediction at\u00a0420,000 voters\u00a0(292,000 Democratic ballots and 128,000 Republican ballots.) If realized, that would be the most votes cast in a presidential primary featuring an incumbent president.\u00a0 However, on a phone call with reporters Monday, New Hampshire Democratic Chair Ray Buckley said, \"I don't think anyone is predicting anywhere near the 2008 turnout. I think we will have a terrific turnout. It will certainly be higher than any other state in the entire nominating process. But there's no indication we'll match or be near 2008.\" In New Hampshire, undeclared or independent voters, who make up 42% of the current electorate, may pick up either a Democratic or Republican ballot on primary day. There are more independents this cycle compared to 2016 (38%), the majority coming from the Republican Party. In 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire primary by over 22 points (56,838 votes). Hillary Clinton went on to win New Hampshire against Donald Trump by just 0.3% (less than 2,700 votes.) In New Hampshire alone, over 4,400 wrote in Senator Bernie Sanders' name during the general election. The Candidates Bernie Sanders:\u00a0While a double-digit victory seems nearly impossible this time around, the Sanders campaign hopes to drive turnout in all corners of the state \u2013 particularly on college campuses and in counties bordering Vermont. State director Shannon Jackson says the campaign has made a point of interacting with voters across the state, even the less populated North Country. \"We've been proud to have knocked on a ton of doors, going as high up as Pittsfield and as far left as Lancaster, really targeting areas for door-knocking, and bringing people into the process that have not ever had their doors knocked on before.\" The Sanders campaign, which won every town except three in 2016, says its approach is more \"comprehensive\" than \"targeted,\" placing nearly $6 million in advertisements in all three broadcast markets bordering New Hampshire. The Vermont senator has made multiple tours of college campuses here, a \"huge priority\" for the campaign that calls its candidate the \"oldest millennial.\" Joe Biden\u00a0has predicted he'll likely \"take a hit\" in New Hampshire. Biden has been dampening expectations for himself, and his campaign has been largely dark on the New Hampshire air waves, though the super PAC supporting him has been advertising on TV this week.\u00a0 Biden boasts one of the strongest groups of surrogates here, including former New Hampshire Governor John Lynch, Former New Hampshire Congresswoman Carol Shea Porter and longtime Granite State political adviser, Billy Shaheen. Biden senior adviser Terry Shumaker says he feels Biden can appeal to \"all three\" kinds of independent voters: independents that tend to vote Democrats, independents that tend to vote Republican and true independents. \"I don't see our market as just being independents,\" he said conceding that \"obviously, other candidates like Klobuchar and Buttigieg will have some appeal with independents, as well.\" Biden is the the only top-tier candidate who has not held public events in all 10 counties in New Hampshire, skipping Carroll County. Since\u00a0Pete Buttigieg\u00a0came out on top of the field in Iowa with Sanders, he's seen a rapid rise in the polls here and an influx of new volunteers this past weekend. His campaign in New Hampshire has 16 statewide office locations, placing some outposts in post-industrial New Hampshire that may feel forgotten: Berlin, Claremont, Conway. \"Relational organizing\" is an oft-heard phrase from the campaign, which has hosted dozens of house parties over the past few weeks to foster \"neighbor-to-neighbor\" persuasion. In his closing argument, Buttigieg rallied mayors and local leaders around his experience as mayor, to counter a\u00a0recent attack ad from the Biden campaign. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0began door knocking early last summer in rural areas of the state, including Coos and Carroll County. The strategy attracted large crowds at rallies in more remote towns.\u00a0 Warren's campaign has the built-in advantage of a headquarters in Boston, just 45 minutes away from the New Hampshire state line. It has an active presence on college campuses, and across the southern part of the state. \"There are certain areas of the state, college campuses for instance \u2013 Durham, Plymouth, Keene \u2013 that are important because Senator Sanders really rocked in those four years ago,\" Warren supporter and DNC Councilwoman Kathy Sullivan told CBS News. \"In the southern tier, those towns are heavy Republican but there are still a lot of Democratic voters and independents critical to any campaign.\" Warren's team is widely recognized by lawmakers and local officials across the state as having one of the most well-organized, well-run operations in New Hampshire \u2014 complete with her famous selfie lines. Amy Klobuchar\u00a0has received the endorsement of the Union Leader, the Keene Sentinel and the Portsmouth Herald \u2013 a full sweep of New Hampshire local papers. Riding a post-debate bump, Klobuchar's campaign picked up a whopping $3 million in fundraising since this weekend's New Hampshire debate. Since her strong debate performance, tracking polls by\u00a0CBS Boston/Boston Globe/Suffolk\u00a0University and\u00a0Emerson polling\u00a0show a last-minute surge for Klobuchar, who has vaulted into third place. Klobuchar's campaign has been catering to the roughly half of undecided voters still making up their minds. The Minnesota lawmaker has earned the support of a plethora of local leaders including Councilor Deborah Pignatelli, former Attorney General Joe Foster and Laconia Mayor Andrew Hosmer. That surrogate surge helped Klobuchar \"level the playing field\" during her time away in Washington during the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump.\u00a0 Andrew Yang\u00a0began campaigning in New Hampshire two years ago, a move New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley says allowed the lesser-known candidate to gain traction on the national stage. Yang has recruited volunteer help from outside the state, attracting grassroots support from podcasters, youtube celebrities and self-funded full-time campaign volunteers who frequently travel with him across New Hampshire. The campaign utilized successful Q3 and Q4 fundraising hauls to invest in digital and TV advertising, spending more than any other candidate in the Boston media market except Tom Steyer and Bernie Sanders. While struggling to fill open campaign positions in the fall, the upstart team now has 50 staffers and 10 offices. Senior New Hampshire adviser Steve Marchand says Yang hopes earn the support of disaffected voters. Last year Yang said his campaign was over if he didn't perform well here: \"If this does not come out of New Hampshire, it dies.\"\u00a0 Tom Steyer has visited the state fewer times than any top-tier presidential candidate, spending a sum total of 16 days in the Granite State. Notably, the businessman has invested more than any candidate in New Hampshire's airwaves, nearly $20 million overall. But he'll skip primary night here to launch a bus tour in the nation's next early contest state: Nevada. In late 2019, Michael Bennet\u00a0abandoned all other state operations to double down on New Hampshire, announcing he would host 50 town halls in the final 10 weeks leading up the New Hampshire Primary. Joined by supporter James Carville, the Colorado senator met that goal this past weekend. His focus on retail politicking mirrors the style of another Colorado senator and eventual winner of the New Hampshire primary, Gary Hart. Deval Patrick buoys support and organizing manpower from the Bay State.\u00a0\u00a0Despite a slow start, Patrick's campaign turned out 800 attendees at the annual Shaheen-McIntyre dinner. \"I don't think you have to hate Republicans to be a good Democrat,\" Patrick said, in a departure from his rivals' condemnation of Mitch McConnell and the present administration. Patrick hosted the\u00a0longest bus tour\u00a0in this cycle's primary \u2014 six days spanning all 10 counties during Iowa's caucuses. Tulsi Gabbard\u00a0has all but moved to New Hampshire, renting a house on the outskirts of Manchester for several months leading up to the primary. Roughly half of the New Hampshire towns Gabbard has visited in New Hampshire backed Mr. Trump in 2016. Her anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and former Democratic Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. But she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream Democratic voters who pick their party's nominee. Her campaign opened up its very first field office last month in downtown Manchester, operated by 50 full-time volunteers in New Hampshire. The Republicans President Trump hosts a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire on the eve of the primaries at SNHU Arena. His last New Hampshire rally took place just months ago on\u00a0August 15, 2019 at the same venue. President Donald Trump is on the ballot. And while it is all but certain the incumbent will win the Republican primary, the Trump campaign field team has been knocking on doors in New Hampshire for months, encouraging registered Republicans to cast a ballot in support of the president, who faces 16 challengers including Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld.\u00a0 The final weekend polling Recent battleground tracker polls from\u00a0CBS Boston/Boston Globe/Suffolk\u00a0University and\u00a0Emerson polling\u00a0show a post-debate surge for Amy Klobuchar, vaulting into third. Bernie Sanders maintains his lead, followed by Pete Buttigieg. Our latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll has Sanders at 29% support among likely voters (up two points from\u00a0January) while Buttigieg is at 25% \u2014 having gained 12 points since then. Many of Buttigieg's recent gains come at the expense of Joe Biden, who is now at 12%. Elizabeth Warren is in front of Biden with 17%, and Amy Klobuchar just behind him at 10%. The rules There's no early voting in New Hampshire, but residents may register on Election Day at their polling location. There are over 300 polling sites in New Hampshire. Polls must open by 11 a.m. ET, but some open as early as 6 a.m.\u00a0A full list can be found here. In three tiny unincorporated places \u2014 Hart's Location, Dixville Notch and Millsfield \u2014 voters open their polls at midnight and close them just moments later, once everyone has voted. Six-thousand election officials, plus 50 investigators and lawyers from the New Hampshire office of the attorney general will run and oversee polling sites. By law, town moderators must announce and post results before departing each poll location. New Hampshire's constitution requires that each precinct moderator publicly announce and post the election results before departing polling locations. Election tabulations publicly announced by the moderator are delivered by town clerks to one of 36 locations across the state in a special envelope. At 5 a.m. Wednesday morning, police across the state pick up those envelopes and deliver them to the State House by 7 a.m. Those results will be made available by the state at noon. The results New Hampshire officials anticipate a late night for election results Tuesday. Candidates amassing over 15% of the total share of votes are rewarded delegates. New Hampshire has 33 delegates \u2013 16 are split up among New Hampshire's two congressional districts, and were picked January 25, 2020. Another eight are selected by those 16 delegates to join them at the Milwaukee convention. This leaves nine other delegates, who are \"automatic delegates,\" meaning they will be composed of the state's congressional delegation, plus current and former state officials. These nine will only serve as tiebreakers, and will not count towards the initial delegate count. The\u00a0DNC\u00a0requires that these delegates are split evenly by gender (12 total males, 12 total females). CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

            "article_content": "Top GOP lawmakers dismissed President Trump's\u00a0refusal to commit\u00a0to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the election to Joe Biden, although many congressional Republicans have so far remained silent on the subject,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0and\u00a0digital politics reporter Grace Segers\u00a0report.\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted Thursday: \"The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th. There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.\" Although McConnell did not single out Mr. Trump by name, his statement proved a clear response to the president, who was asked at a White House news conference Wednesday evening if he would commit to a peaceful transfer following the election. \"Well, we're going to have to see what happens,\" the president remarked before railing against the use of mail-in ballots as he has done for months. The president's comments come days before he is expected to announce his nominee to the Supreme Court to\u00a0fill the vacancy\u00a0left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. If Mr. Trump's nominee is confirmed, conservatives will have a solid 6 to 3 majority on the court, which may help to tilt any election-related cases in the president's favor. The president also stated he does not believe he will lose, adding there would not be a transfer of power but instead a \"continuation.\" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Thursday that the president would accept the results of the election if he loses: \"The president will accept the results of a free and fair election.\" But just 40 days always from Election Day, GOP lawmakers bristled at Mr. Trump's open questioning of the U.S. electoral process. Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, a frequent critic of the president, quickly rebuked Mr. Trump, calling his comments \"unthinkable and unacceptable.\" Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida also responded to Mr. Trump's comments on Thursday morning,\u00a0tweeting, \"as we have done for over two centuries we will have a legitimate & fair election.\" Senator Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an interview with Fox News on Thursday morning that the transfer of power would be \"peaceful.\" Graham added, \"Now, we may have litigation about who won the election, but the court will decide if the Republicans lose we will accept that result.\" He continued, \"No matter who challenges the results of the election, eventually the Supreme Court is likely to hear that challenge. And when they rule that is that is the end of it.\" If the Republican-controlled Senate confirms a justice to the Supreme Court ahead of the election, that means that three of the nine justices would have been nominated by Mr. Trump. Congressman Steve Stivers, the former chair for the National Republican Congressional Committee, was one of the first House Republicans to address the topic on Thursday morning,\u00a0tweeting, \"I've taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and I will uphold that oath.\"\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that members in competitive seats such as John Katko in New York's 24th or\u00a0Michael McCaul\u00a0in Texas' 10th agreed the transition will be peaceful. Other House Republicans like Jim Banks of Indiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio have pushed back, saying that Democrats have still refused to accept the 2016 results. \"Not sure why R's get so many questions about honoring election results. It is D's that have refused to accept election results for 4 years, using a special counsel & impeachment to overturn 2016. They're even talking about changing the rules & getting rid of electoral college!\" Banks\u00a0tweeted. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a freshman House Democrat running in a district Mr. Trump won by 7 points, said in a statement, \"He has laid the groundwork to refuse the peaceful transition of power. And if he loses, it will be up to those around him to either support his claims, or step back.\" Slotkin is a former CIA analyst who has previously challenged Mr. Trump before on matters of national security, such as the Ukraine transcript, and added in her statement that she's pressed DHS and senior military officials before about a peaceful transition of power. Almost 500 national security officials, including former senior military leaders, endorsed Joe Biden for president and cited in a\u00a0letter\u00a0Biden's responsibility and moral clarity for reason enough to vote for the Democratic presidential ticket. The Biden campaign on Thursday also criticized Mr. Trump for proactively suggesting the November election results may not be valid. \"Donald Trump is trying to distract from his catastrophic failures as president of the United States in order to - to talk about something that, frankly, you know is - spins up the press corps so that you guys are focused on this and not focused on how he has not put forward a meaningful healthcare plan and how he has spent the entirety of this administration in court trying to tear down the Affordable Care Act,\" deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said on a healthcare conference call with reporters. \"Joe Biden has obviously participated in peaceful transition of power before, he certainly will this time around as well,\" she added. With 40 days to go until the election, Democratic nominee had no public events today. Asked by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0about Biden's debate preparation, the campaign was mum on details but they did lay down some expectations for next week's debate moderator, Chris Wallace. \"In terms of how the moderator chooses to referee the debate, obviously you know our hope is that he will hold Donald Trump accountable for things that he says that are simply lies and mistruths,\" Bedingfield said. \"But that will be up to the moderator and we'll see what he chooses to do.\" Mr. Trump is holding a rally Thursday night in Jacksonville, Florida, located in Duval County, an area he won by little more than a point in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. The county went to Republicans in the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections as well, but turned blue for the gubernatorial and Senate races in the 2018 midterms. The president is now focusing in with Florida being one of the biggest battlegrounds of 2020. Trump supporters in their MAGA gear had been lining up all day. Some supporters carried \"Florida loves Judge Amy Barrett!\" signs signaling their support for one of the names floated at a potential Trump pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. They also chanted \"fill the seat\" as they waited to enter the hanger at Cecil Airport. Supporters claimed Democrats would try to do the same if the shoe were on the other foot, and they wanted a vote on a nominee before the election. For multiple people, this was not their first Trump event. And while the pandemic continues, few practiced social distancing or wore masks. Multiple people praised the president's handling of the coronavirus, claiming he shut down the border to China and was trying to keep the calm, a claim the president has made amid recent revelations he played down the virus early on despite knowing how dangerous it is. Florida has in-person, absentee voting by mail and early in-person voting, which begins October 19 and ends November 1. While the President has continually claimed vote by mail is fraudulent, he\u00a0tweeted\u00a0in August that Florida's vote by mail is \"Safe and Secure,\" a call echoed by some of his top surrogates in the state and Florida Republicans, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell. Some of his supporters in Jacksonville indicated they would be voting by mail or early in-person for the November election. All supporters CBS News spoke with expressed confidence the president would win re-election when every vote was counted. Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Wisconsin and Minnesota today for White House and campaign events. At a \"Made in America\" event in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Pence toured Midwest Manufacturing and highlighted the Trump Administration's work to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. Pence credited the United States, Mexico and Canada (USMCA) trade deal for helping make that happen. The vice president attacked Democratic VP nominee Kamala Harris for her vote against the USMCA. \"Dairy farmers in this state, you all deserve to know that Joe Biden's running mate, Senator Kamala Harris actually put her own environmental agenda ahead of Wisconsin dairy and ahead of Wisconsin manufacturing,\" Pence said. The crowd cheered loudly when Pence said the president will nominate a \"principled, conservative woman\" on Saturday. The vice president also commented on the two police officers who were shot during protests last night in Louisville, Kentucky. Pence said the two officers are expected to recover and added that \"violence against law enforcement must stop, and it must stop now.\" After Wisconsin, Pence held a \"Cops for Trump\" campaign event in Minneapolis. The listening session also included the president's daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump. Prior to the event, several voters told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0they are concerned about violence at protests and worry about the safety of police officers. Gwen Arsoneli is retired and lives in the Twin Cities suburbs. She said she is \"disgusted\" by some of the violence she's seen at recent protests and added that \"you can raise yourself up\" from poverty through hard work, not protests. Arsonelli said she believes those protesting police injustice are seeking a government handout. \"I think they are taking it too far. There are other ways to going about solving the problems instead of looting,\" she said. According to pool reports, Pence also made a last-minute unscheduled stop at a beauty salon in the area. Flora Westbrooks' salon was burned to the ground during protests in Minneapolis at the end of May. According to a GoFundMe page that was set up to help Westbrooks rebuild, she said police \"never showed\" and didn't patrol her area that night her business was destroyed. The salon was burned down just as it was getting ready to reopen after being closed because of the coronavirus. For decades, Kent County in the western part of Michigan has been a Republican stronghold, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. It's where Gerald Ford was raised and where the DeVos family earned its fortune. According to the Daily Kos' presidential tracker, just one Democrat has carried the county since 1964: Barack Obama in 2008. While Mr. Obama won Michigan by 16.5 points, he carried Kent County by just half a point, or 1,573 votes. But in the past decade or so, the county's biggest city, Grand Rapids, and its surrounding suburbs have seen major growth. It's the fourth most populated county in the state with over 600,000 residents and the most populated county outside of southeast Michigan. The growth has come from more younger people moving to the area and the population has become more diverse, two trends that have opened the door to Democratic gains. In 2014, former Republican Governor Rick Snyder beat Democratic candidate Mark Schauer by 26 points. Two years later, Republicans in the county softened on President Trump. He kept the county red, but won it by about 3 points. He beat Hillary Clinton by 9,497 votes, nearly the same margin as his 10,704 vote win in Michigan in 2016. Michigan's Democratic Governor managed to turn the county blue in 2018, winning by 4.1 points, fueled partly by gains in the suburbs that helped Democrats around the country during the midterms. Democrats have tried to seize on the changing demographics. They've moved their county party office into a more visible area and Kent County Democratic Chair Gary Start says there has been a \"crush of volunteers\" largely motivated by beating President Trump. \"I think the overriding issue with Democratic voters here is that we have to get rid of Donald Trump,\" Stark said. \"It's a referendum on Trump.\" Stark and local Democrats also hear a lot about health care and the environment. Party volunteers haven't been knocking doors due to the pandemic but have been dropping off packets of information at doors, urging voters to support Democrats up and down the ticket. While Whitmer won by 4 points, Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow beat Republican challenger John James by just 0.3 points. Republicans in the county credit that performance partly to more enthusiasm for James than Whitmer's opponent. There's no lack of enthusiasm for the president, Kent County Republican Chair Joel Freeman said, and with Trump back on the ticket, people who may have sat out the race in 2018 will be back casting ballots. \"I think for Democrats, they still saw the president as being on the ticket,\" Freeman said, referring to 2018. \"A lot of those new voters that came out for Trump didn't necessarily see him on the ballot.\" The President's supporters in the county are focused on the economy and some are feeling motivated by Whitmer's response to the pandemic, Freeman said. Jill Biden visited Grand Rapids last week and Freeman hopes the president will make a stop in the area before the election. In 2016, Trump's final campaign stop was in Grand Rapids to shore up the vote in Kent County and strongly Republican surrounding areas. \"He closed out that campaign in 2016 here and that was, you know, the west side of the state, we brought it home for him,\" Freeman said. CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0spoke\u00a0with business owners from Colorado's tourism industry, all of whom shared thoughtful insights into the pandemic and how the country/their state is responding. Each said that while the pandemic and shutdown was the worst situation imaginable, business-wise they're doing better than they first anticipated at the start of the pandemic. They've had to make creative alterations to their business models - like an amusement park owner who is short staffed is hoping to hire retirees who travel the country in RVs looking for seasonal work. And to accommodate his latest hires, they are building RV outposts near the park entrance. The world-renown ski season in Colorado will look completely different this year as well. The owners CBS spoke to feel they are prepared for anything. Mr. Trump has signed a series of \"America First\" executive orders aimed at halting surprise medical billing and assuring health care coverage for Americans with preexisting medical conditions, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"The days of ripping Americans off are over,\" Mr. Trump declared to supporters in North Carolina on Thursday at an official White House event. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters on a press call Thursday that one of the new executive orders will make \"a statement of United States policy...that preexisting conditions are protected\" while another will pressure Congress to pass legislation stopping surprise medical billing by January 1 before \"us[ing] the full regulatory power of the U.S. government to protect patients.\" The president's executive action comes as the Trump administration aims to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which prevents insurers from discriminating against Americans with preexisting conditions. The Trump administration filed a Supreme Court brief in June, asking the high court to invalidate it. The case will be heard in November, one week after Election Day. \"If we win, we will have a better and less expensive plan that will always protect individuals with preexisting conditions,\" President Trump said of the lawsuit, offering few details. Medical experts have expressed skepticism that Mr. Trump has the authority to require insurers to cover individuals with preexisting conditions. On the conference call Thursday, Azar stressed the president's executive orders were legally enforceable. \"We will work with Congress, more or otherwise, to ensure that they're protected,\" he added. The number of Americans filing for unemployment aid remains stuck at a high level, reports\u00a0CBS News digital data reporter Irina Ivanova. Some 870,000 people filed for state unemployment benefits in the week ending September 19, the Labor Department\u00a0said\u00a0Thursday. (The figures are adjusted for seasonal variation.) That amounts to an increase of 4,000 from the week before, and is four times the typical weekly level before the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic\u00a0began in March. Another 630,000 workers applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a program for the self-employed and gig workers. \"Layoff announcements are ongoing, indicative of continuing strains in the labor market,\" Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics told investors in a research note. \"Even as nearly half of payroll losses have been recovered, it is likely further progress will be more modest given slowing momentum in economic activity recently.\" Most economists say that the job market will not fully recover without more aid from the federal government. Job growth has slowed in recent months, and employers in most industries appear reluctant to hire new workers in the face of deep uncertainty about the course of the virus. \"[T]he clear picture that has emerged in the recent employment figures is a continued slowdown in the pace of rehiring across the private sector,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. A total of 26 million people were receiving some sort of unemployment aid in the first week of September, a drop of 3.7 million from the last week of August. That figure has declined steadily over the past several months, reflecting that some unemployed people are being re-hired but others are exhausting their jobless aid, which is time-limited in most states. Since the end of July, an extra $600 weekly benefit that some unemployed workers received has run out, and Congress has failed to agree on additional financial assistance. Some states have applied for a temporary $300 weekly boost Mr. Trump created via executive order, but that benefit has expired in\u00a0at least seven states. The new unemployment data coincides with evidence that some newly laid-off Americans are facing delays in receiving unemployment benefits, with state agencies intensifying efforts to combat fraud, the Associated Press reports. California has said it will stop processing new applications for two weeks as it seeks to reduce backlogs and prevent fraudulent claims. Pennsylvania has found that up to 10,000 inmates are improperly receiving aid. The growing concerns about fraudulent applications for unemployment benefits have focused mainly on Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. The new federal program, created as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act in March, made self-employed people, gig workers and contractors eligible for jobless aid for the first time. Though roughly 14 million people are classified as receiving aid under that program, economists increasingly regard that figure as unreliable and likely inflated by both fraudulent applications and inaccurate counts. The number of people receiving benefits under the PUA program is probably overstated by several million, economists say. Senator Bernie Sanders described Mr. Trump's refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power as a threat to democracy in an impassioned speech on Thursday, saying that the president \"has little respect for our constitution or the rule of law.\" In a speech delivered at The George Washington University Sanders said, \"This is not just an election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. This is an election between Donald Trump and democracy - and democracy must win.\" He called Mr. Trump a \"pathological liar\" with \"strong authoritarian tendencies,\" adding that the president is \"prepared to undermine American democracy in order to stay in power.\"\u00a0CBS News digital politics reporter Grace Segers\u00a0reports Sanders also criticized Mr. Trump for continuing \"to be obsessed with the belief that there is massive voter fraud in this country,\" even though instances of voter fraud are extremely rare. The president has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that mail-in voting leads to widespread voter fraud, even as he urges supporters to vote by mail in critical swing states like Florida. \"Trump's strategy to delegitimize this election and to stay in office if he loses is not complicated. Finding himself behind in many polls, he is attempting massive voter suppression,\" Sanders said. \"He and his Republican colleagues are doing everything they can to make it harder and harder for people to vote. In addition, he is sowing the seeds of chaos, confusion and conspiracy theories by casting doubt on the integrity of this election and, if he loses, justifying why he should remain in office.\" Following Mr. Sanders' remarks, the senator spoke with\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte,\u00a0who covered Sanders on the campaign trail. Sanders said that he worries \"very much\" about violence and chaos in this country popping up after the election, no matter the result. He threatened the president for potentially not accepting election results with a message: \"Sorry, too many people fought and died to defend democracy to allow him to destroy it.\"\u00a0Korte\u00a0asked Sanders if by elevating this issue he's playing into the president's hands and amplifying a scary scenario that may never happen. Sanders laughed and denied he is helping the president. When CBS News asked if Sanders was in consultation with the Biden campaign on the issue of a power transition, Sanders said simply that he has \"spoken\" to the Biden camp about it. In an article published Thursday, Politico\u00a0reported\u00a0Democrats in Florida are apprehensive as the margin of voter registrations for Republicans and Democrats shrinks after the state's Republicans \"added a party record of almost 58,000 new voters -- a 91 percent increase compared to August 2016\" last month. According to data provided by the Florida Division of Elections, there were more than 5.2 million active registered Democrats in the state as of August 31--just 183,596 more than the more than 5 million Republicans that have registered to vote in November. Florida Communications Director for the Biden campaign Carlie Waibel said in a statement that despite the shrinking gap in voter registrations and a mostly virtual operation due to the coronavirus pandemic, Florida Democrats still have momentum in the state. \"The reality is Democrats have amassed an overwhelming vote by mail advantage and turned out in historic numbers for the primary election in August,\" said Waibel in a statement. \"That momentum, coupled with our voter registration advantage this cycle, prove Democrats here are fired up and ready to make Trump a one-term president.\" The Republican Party of Florida and Trump Victory Florida currently have more than 200 staffers and have made more than 17 million voter contacts with nearly 2 million knocked doors according to a spokesperson. Their team has also held more than 5,000 grassroots events with tens of thousands of volunteers, according to their team.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that state elections data also shows that to date, of the 3,039 voters that have already voted by mail, more than half were Democrats. Additionally, 2.2 million Democrats have been provided with absentee ballots compared to 1.5 million provided to Republicans in the state. Sharon Shierholz, a Florida senior in Leesburg, plans to vote for President Trump in November and said she'll be voting in person because she doesn't trust the postal service and fears her ballot could be lost. \"I'm getting in my car with my ballot, I'm driving to the supervisor of elections, I'm getting out, I'm walking in the building, I'm putting it in there,\" said Shierholz describing her voting plan. \"I will let no one touch my ballot.\" A special election will occur in February 2021 in Minnesota's 2nd congressional district following the death of Legal Marijuana Now Party candidate Adam Weeks, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. In a statement, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon offered condolences to Weeks' families and friends and outlined the next steps for the election. \"The loss of any of us is a tragedy, and that's felt especially in someone who has put his energy into a campaign to serve in public office,\" Simon added. \"The law is clear on what happens next. If a major party nominee dies within 79 days of Election Day; a special election will be held for that office on the second Tuesday of February (February 9, 2021).\" Weeks was challenging Democrat incumbent Angie Craig and Republican candidate Tyler Kistner. In a press release, Simon's office said that if voters have already voted absentee or voted early in person, they do not need to request another ballot. A Simon spokesperson said that votes in the 2nd congressional district race will not be counted until the special election in February 2021. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Thursday denied a request to stay their decision to accept mail-in ballots 3 days after Election Day if they're postmarked by Election Day. Requests earlier this week from the Pennsylvania GOP and state legislature interveners for the stay signaled they would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. They argue that the ruling permits ballots to be counted that are cast after November 3, but the law states that they cannot be. The ruling does allow ballots with an illegible postmark to be counted if received 3 days after the election, so some of those could theoretically be cast the day after Election Day and counted. Also in Pennsylvania, lawyers for a half dozen states today sought to connect the Postal Service's leadership with mail delays they say could affect the 2020 election. A PowerPoint from a July 10 presentation given by David E. Williams, chief logistics and processing operations office at the Postal Service, informed officials that \"Effective July 13 all extra trips and Postal caused late trips are unauthorized contractual commitments.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0reports it was among the documents presented by Democratic attorneys general in a Pennsylvania federal court this morning, and it had been turned over by USPS in discovery. Lawyers for the Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and for the Postal Service said the PowerPoint was in fact prepared by a low-level manager. They argued in court on Thursday that the directive was meant only to call for more mail to be delivered on time, and thus for fewer extra trips to be needed. The lawsuit, led by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, asks the court to halt USPS service changes that he and the attorneys general of five other states and the District of Columbia say could lead to some mail votes not being counted. A federal investigation has found that nine military general election ballots were discarded in the battleground county of Luzerne in Pennsylvania, according to U.S. Attorney David Freed from the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Seven were for President Donald Trump, and the other two are unknown, said Freed, a Republican. Mr. Trump's press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, mentioned the finding earlier in a White House press briefing. The Luzerne County District Attorney's office said in a statement that they were informed of \"issues with a small number of mail-in ballots,\" on September 17. That was the same day that the Supreme Court ruled that the Green Party would not be on the ballot, lifting a stay and allowing the secretary of the commonwealth to certify the ballot. Luzerne's district attorney, Stefanie Salavantis, a Republican, said that the county elections office had already sent some military ballots ahead of the court's decision because of a deadline to do so by two days after. The local district attorney's office found out about the returned ballots because some of them had been opened despite state law stating that they can't be opened until Election Day, she said. Nevada\u00a0announced this week\u00a0it would become the latest to offer voters statewide the option to subscribe to phone or email tracking when voting by mail, as several counties in the battleground state are beginning to send out ballots, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Nevada will rely on BallotTrax for the alerts, which is currently offering the service without charge to the state for the current election. Though just one in ten votes in Nevada were returned by mail in 2018, the state moved in August to mail ballots to all active registered voters in response to the coronavirus pandemic. \"BallotTrax was chosen because it was offered at no charge and was recommended by other states that regularly conduct mail-in elections,\" Jennifer Russell, public information officer for Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, said in an email. John Stavinga, a spokesperson for BallotTrax, says four other states - California, Colorado, Georgia, and North Carolina - have also signed contracts with the firm, with counties inside those states electing to opt into the service. Some 400 counties total are planning to use BallotTrax, according to Stavinga.\u00a0For more on how to vote in your own state, head to\u00a0CBS News States & Dates.",

            "article_content": "As counting nears completion, the subject of possible recounts in this tight election has been regularly raised. Some states trigger recounts automatically if certain margins are met, in others they must be initiated by officials or candidates. Because of chaos in Florida following the 2000 election, the mention of a recount is alarming for many. But consider this context: historically, recounts re-aggregate very few votes, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. Therefore, for them to affect final calls, margins have to be very, very, very thin. In 2016, there were two recounts. In Wisconsin, President Trump's winning margin got a 131-vote boost. In Nevada, a recount added only three votes to Hillary Clinton's statewide win. In 2004, a recount in New Hampshire added three votes to John Kerry's win. In Ohio that year, a recount reduced President George W. Bush's win margin by only 285 votes. None of those races were even close to being changed because of the recount. The 2000 race is of course an extreme example. The recount there, riddled in controversy, in the end reduced Mr. Bush's win by about 1,400 votes. So when you look at the margins this election season, the likelihood is that recounts won't ultimately change the results. After days of scouring for a spokesperson for their upcoming legal battle, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner has selected Trump campaign adviser and longtime loyalist Dave Bossie to spearhead the efforts. In a departure from Thursday's crush of press conferences in battleground states, Trump campaign allies and surrogates, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, convened at the campaign's headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, on Friday to map the path forward. Despite his narrowing lead,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports the president has given no indication he will concede to his Democratic opponent in the short term. \"Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President,\" President Trump tweeted on Friday afternoon. \"I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!\" But candidates do not claim the presidency, rather a candidate wins the White House after they reach 270 electoral votes. Although customary, concessions by the losing candidate are not required by the Constitution for a successful transfer of power. On Thursday night, the president charged his political foes and the media of trying to steal the election from him, following a slew of Trump campaign lawsuits. \"If you count the legal votes, I easily win,\" the president falsely claimed on Thursday night. Lawsuits filed by the president's reelection bid in Michigan and Georgia have already been dismissed after failing to provide evidence of voting irregularities. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are expected to address the country Friday evening in primetime,\u00a0CBS News\u00a0campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. Biden is planning to address the nation tonight in Delaware about his growing lead -- even if news outlets have yet to project him the winner, according to people familiar with his plans. Aides spent Friday making preliminary plans for him to speak again tonight on the presumption that he would be over the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the White House, report\u00a0CBS News political correspondents Ed O'Keefe\u00a0and\u00a0Nikole Killion\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters\u00a0Bo Erickson\u00a0and\u00a0Tim Perry.\u00a0But now, one aide familiar with Biden's remarks tonight says the former vice president will speak out \"not to declare victory but to give the kind of update he's done previously -- with even more enthusiasm. Last time he was before the press he trailed in Georgia, he trailed in Pennsylvania, he had a single digit lead in Nevada. But now, with Biden holding the advantage in those states, Biden plans to tout more progress.\" Throughout the day, as Biden took the lead in Georgia and then Pennsylvania, Biden's campaign came to life after days of subdued hopefulness. Staffers are bustling around the Wilmington, Delaware, event site as some start prepping their celebration strategies. If Biden is declared the victor Friday evening, the transition process is expected to begin this week with full steam ahead on Monday. White House senior staff appointments are expected early in the process to keep momentum, sources told CBS News. CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says protests continue for a third day outside the ballot tabulation site in Maricopa County, Arizona's most populous, with GOP leaders and right-wing conspiracy theorists among those to rally supporters outside the facility in Phoenix. In a press conference Friday afternoon, Georgia's voting system implementation manager Gabriel Sterling told reporters that 18,000 overseas and military absentee ballots have been accepted throughout the state. As many as 8,410 overseas and military absentee ballots can still be counted in Georgia if they were postmarked by Election Day and received by today.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that Sterling also said earlier Friday that there were 4,169 outstanding ballots that should be counted by this evening, though by the end of the day it was unclear that this timeline was still feasible. The margin in Georgia remains tight. As of 4 p.m., CBS News elections data showed former Vice President Biden ahead of President Trump by 1,564 votes -- or .03% of votes cast up to this point. In a press conference earlier Friday, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told reporters there will be a recount in the state. \"Out of approximately 5 million votes cast we'll have a margin of a few thousand,\" said Raffensperger. \"With a margin that small, there will be a recount in Georgia. Interest in our election, obviously goes far beyond Georgia's borders. The final tally in Georgia at this point has huge implications for the entire country.\" Georgia law states that if the margin of an election is within 0.5%, the candidate that receives the least amount of votes has two business days after the elections results have been certified by the state to request a recount. The latest possible date that a recount can be requested by the runner-up this year is November 22. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate ordered a hand-count audit of one precinct in Jasper County and requested a countywide recount after a discrepancy \"caused by a human error\" impacted the results of a close congressional race in the states' second district, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. Pate said the unofficial election night results, which showed Republican congressional candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks ahead of Democrat Rita Hart by 282 votes was wrong. The results on the secretary of state's website updated this morning showing Hart ahead by 162 votes. There were 561 votes cast at the Clear Creek Poweshiek precinct in the town of Mingo, the location in Jasper County were the hand-count audit will take place. Pate and Jasper County auditor Dennis Parrott said they are confident the update results as of this morning are correct. They will conduct the audit and recount to be certain. The error \"impacted candidates in both political parties, non-partisan candidates, judges, and statewide public measures,\" Pate told reporters Friday morning. Parrott said his office initially tried to solve the issue but eventually asked Pate's office for assistance yesterday at 4:30pm. The county wide recount will take place tomorrow is only expected take a few hours. A judge in Wayne County on Friday rejected an attempt by a poll challenger and non-profit to prevent the Wayne County Board of Canvassers from certifying election results unless all absentee ballots duplicated in Detroit were reviewed by a Republican and Democrat, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The plaintiffs alleged some ballots were remade, a standard process during absentee counting when a ballot isn't read by a machine or there's a an error, without Republicans being involved. Judge Timothy Kenny rejected the request for an injunction to prevent the Wayne County Board of Canvassers from certifying results without the review plaintiffs asked for. \"In this case, everyone wants to make sure that every legitimate vote is counted,\" Kenny said. \"And that here what we have are claims about votes that maybe or have been submitted that are or may not be legitimate. This court finds that while there are assertions made by the plaintiffs that there is no evidence in support of those assertions.\" Separately, the Speaker of the Michigan House, Lee Chatfield, announced oversight committees in the Legislature will meet tomorrow \"to begin an inquiry into the election and counting procedures in our state for this election and future ones.\" Chatfield also said, \"let me be very clear: whoever gets the most votes will win Michigan! Period. End of story. Then we move on.\" Democrats moved to intervene Friday in the suit announced by the Trump campaign over signature verification in Nevada, demanding a change that local officials say could dramatically slow their tabulation, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that in a press release Friday, the North Carolina Board of Elections announced that nine county boards of elections are meeting today to consider a total of at least 4,300 additional absentee by-mail ballots in North Carolina, and approved ballots will be added to the unofficial results on the State Board of Elections website after the meetings. The press release also stated that \"county boards of elections will continue to meet through November 13 to consider additional absentee by-mail ballots that arrive at their offices through November 12, provided they were postmarked on or before Election Day.\" Three days after the election, the country still doesn't know who won in Pennsylvania. After trailing since Tuesday night,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0reports Biden pulled ahead of Mr. Trump on Friday morning. He led by over 16,000 votes, or about 0.3% by evening. Over 100,000 mail ballots received by Election Day remained uncounted, along with over 100,000 provisional ballots cast at the polls. Counties additionally continued to accept mail ballots without late postmarks until Friday evening, but the Trump campaign is asking the Supreme Court to throw out those ballots. The campaign has also brought two additional suits to the Commonwealth Court since Tuesday. One asked the court not to count provisional ballots from voters who had already applied for mail ballots. In the other, the court ruled in the campaign's favor that poll watchers in Philadelphia be allowed closer to ballot counting, but the local Board of Elections appealed to the state Supreme Court. Returns will likely continue to update for days in Pennsylvania, as most counties didn't begin counting provisional ballots until Friday. A grassroots Republican effort in Wisconsin drew national attention for appearing to ask volunteers to call President Trump's supporters in Pennsylvania and ask them to turn in mail ballots after Election Day, but a script reviewed by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0showed the calls were a little different. The email, which CBS News obtained, said \"Trump Victory urgently needs volunteers to make phone calls to Pennsylvania Trump supporters to return their absentee ballots.\" It was dated on Thursday afternoon, two days after ballots had to be postmarked. But a script for callers reviewed by CBS News showed that volunteers were asking people in Pennsylvania who had requested absentee ballots whether they returned those ballots and if they did not, whether they voted a different way. CBS News reached out to Trump Victory Wisconsin but has not heard back. Frantically googling the election? You're not alone. According to Google, \"Election,\" \"results\" and \"election 2020\" were the most searched terms in the U.S. in 24 hours. And all 10 of the most searched terms in the past day were about the election, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. With the close race in Pennsylvania and a steady trickle of results coming in from Philadelphia, \"Philly memes\" spiked 1,950%. People also have Georgia on their mind. Searches of \"what triggers a recount in Georgia\" jumped 700% in the past day while across the country, searches of \"Stacey Abrams\" was also trending. Must see this week: \"ballot count livestream\" searches climbed 500% in the past day. \"What does concede mean\" was also a breakout search. And not surprising in a long election week of battleground state vote counting, Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Michigan have been the top searched states in connection with the election worldwide since Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "In an ad that first aired Tuesday in Grand Rapids, Michigan, flames light up the TV screen, ominous music plays, and a narrator states, \"While America's cities burned, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris fanned the flames.\" The 30-second spot is part of President Trump's final messaging push before Election Day that Mr. Trump will keep Americans safe. The ad differs from the TV spots first aired this week by the Biden campaign, \"I believe it's time to unite the country, to come together as a nation,\" Joe Biden says in a direct-to-camera appeal, reprising common lines from his campaign trail stump speech. In the video testimonial, images of people hugging, holding hands and\u00a0voting\u00a0flash across the screen. While both ads aired for the first time with less than a week to go before\u00a0Election\u00a0Day, they illustrate the diverging approaches of two campaigns in the final months of the campaign season,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0report. Since early September, Biden has outspent Mr. Trump by more than $200 million for television advertising, but data shows that's not the only major difference. An analysis of ads by Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group found Trump campaign ads since June took a more negative tone or contrasted with his opponent. In fact, for a period from mid-June through mid-August, all of the president's TV ads were negative or contrasting. Data shared with CBS News show the president only began infusing positive messaging in his appeals in late August, a trend that soon reversed itself in October with a return to negative and contrasting pitches. Read more\u00a0here. Mr. Trump and Biden both converged on Florida on Thursday, pitching their diverging messages to Sunshine State voters as polls show a tight race with five days to go before Election Day, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. Mr. Trump was also set to travel to Fayetteville, North Carolina, for a rally there, but the campaign postponed the event until Monday \"because of a wind advisory issued with gusts reaching 50 miles per hour and other weather conditions.\" In a Trump campaign call Tuesday with reporters, White House top economic advisor Larry Kudlow praised the president's \"blockbuster\" third quarter numbers.\u00a0CBS News digital data reporter Irina Ivanova\u00a0reports the U.S. economy grew at a record annualized rate of 33.1% between July and September, clawing back much of the ground it had lost during the coronavirus-fueled shutdown earlier in the year, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Increased consumer spending, private investment and exports drove the increase, which was partly offset by falling government spending as stimulus funds dried up and states slashed their budgets. The rebound puts the nation's gross domestic product -- the total value of all the goods and products the economy produces -- at $21.16 trillion for the three months ending in September. That's below its level at the end of last year. Yet experts agree large parts of the economy are still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, the Biden campaign accused the Trump administration of \"gutting businesses\" amid their handling of the coronavirus pandemic, citing double-digit unemployment rates among African Americans and Latinos. For his part, Kudlow warned against future economic shutdowns. \"The evidence is very clear that the states that reopened have outperformed in economic terms and job terms than the states that stayed close,\" the White House adviser said. Speaking at a rally in Tampa, his first of two events on Thursday, Mr. Trump said former candidates for public office have called him and advised him to talk more about future economic growth, and his accomplishments in office,\u00a0CBS News digital White House reporter Kathryn Watson\u00a0reports. But Mr. Trump told his crowd in Tampa he can only talk about those things so much, before it gets boring and prefers to speak about his opponent's son, Hunter Biden. Meanwhile, first lady Melania Trump remained on message while introducing her husband in Tampa, Florida. \"This president and his team are focused on not only destroying the virus and building back the economy, they're focused on creating ways for people to safely stop isolating and start gathering with friends again in safe distances,\" the first lady told supporters. Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in Iowa for the second time this month. A recent\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0showed Mr. Trump and Biden tied in the state, which the president won easily in 2016. A new poll out today from Quinnipiac University showed Mr. Trump ahead 47% to 46% among likely voters. In Des Moines, on a cold airport tarmac with the frigid winds,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0reports Pence also touted today's third quarter GDP numbers. Pence said the 33% increase in GDP during the third quarter shows \"the Great American comeback is on.\" Pence said the \"economy is roaring back\" and warned that a Biden presidency could shut it all down again. He said the election is a choice between a \"Trump recovery\" and a \"Biden depression.\" Pence told supporters to ask their friends and family members who can bring the economy back to full strength: Mr. Trump, \"a proven job creator,\" or Biden, \"a career politician.\" Pence said the president has stood up to China and provided billions in aid to farmers who were struggling during the trade negotiations. He touted the USMCA as a win for Iowa and attacked Biden for not reforming NAFTA. Pence also talked about values and religion - he said under Biden's time as VP, American liberties were \"under assault.\" Pence criticized the Biden-Harris ticket for their support of abortion and told the crowd the election will decide whether America moves forward on path of family, freedom, patriotism, or takes turn toward socialism. Robert Pilon Jr., from nearby Cresco, said he's voting for the president because \"the biggest thing is getting back to normal.\" Pilon Jr, wearing a hoodie that said \"Trump 2020: F***k your feelings,\" said he's worried Biden will shut down the economy. He said he's supporting Mr. Trump again because he wants to see what the economy can really do without a \"plandemic.\" Retired farmer Ron Cheraal, who's waiting to vote in-person on Election Day, said he's not worried about the coronavirus because \"it's the flu.\" Cheraal said \"when I was a kid we had the polio to worry about.\" He added \"polio was serious and we made it through that, we could certainly make it through this.\" In his first stop in Florida on Thursday, Biden laid down an election benchmark at his drive-in rally in Broward County: \"If Florida goes blue, it's over, its over!\" This is Biden's fourth general election campaign trip to the state, making the it Biden's second-most visited battleground, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. Biden said Mr. Trump's \"super spreader event\" across town is sure to sow both the virus and division. As he competes for the voters of Cuban-American and Venezuelan-American voters, Biden called for a \"new Cuba policy\" and said the president is the \"worst possible standard bearer for democracy\" in places like Cuba and Venezuela. Biden said he would stand up to \"thug\" Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela and lashed the president for not granting temporary protective status to Venezuelans fleeing that country. Courting additional Latino supporter,\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0reported Biden's new promise earlier Thursday that on Day One of his presidency, he will establish a task force to reunite the recently reported 545 immigrant children separated from their families. Tomorrow the Democratic candidate is set to have his busiest day yet on the general election campaign trail as he heads to Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin. Chester is the only county in Pennsylvania that went red to blue in 2016, and it's emblematic of the suburban resistance to Mr. Trump in the state, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Nestled outside Philadelphia, Chester was once a reliable GOP county. President Obama won there in 2008, the first time a Democrat did since Lyndon Johnson, but lost narrowly to Mitt Romney in 2012. But in 2016, when Republicans still outnumbered Democrats in the county, Hillary Clinton won there by 25,000 votes. Since then, Democrats have gained 20,000 voters while Republicans have stayed level. Democrats for the first time in recent history outnumber Republicans in Chester. It's a trend that came earlier for the other three \"collar counties\" of Philadelphia - Bucks, Delaware, and Montgomery, all of which turned blue at different points in the last 15 years. The question in this region is whether suburban aversion to President Trump can drive more traditional Republicans to vote for Joe Biden, giving him a boost that could offset blue collar losses. The Republican Party of Wisconsin says hackers stole $2.3 million from the party's coffers, which was being used to help election efforts in the home stretch of the campaign, the state party's chairman said today. According to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster, the Wisconsin GOP discovered it was the victim of a phishing attack on October 22 and told the FBI the following day that hackers obtained $2.3 million through doctored invoices. The party is working with the FBI as they conduct their investigation. \"Cybercriminals, using a sophisticated phishing attack, stole funds intended for the re-election of President Trump, altered invoices and committed wire fraud,\" Wisconsin GOP Chair Andrew Hitt said in a statement on Thursday. \"These criminals exhibited a level of familiarity with state party operations at the end of the campaign to commit this crime. While a large sum of money was stolen, our operation is running at full capacity with all the resources deployed to ensure President Donald J. Trump carries Wisconsin on November 3rd.\" There is no evidence at this point that hackers got their hands on any proprietary information. News of the hacking comes just days before Election Day in a critical battleground state that President Trump won by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016. Mr. Trump will make his fourth stop in Wisconsin this month on Friday when he visits Green Bay. Biden will also be in the state on Friday, his third trip to the state since becoming the Democratic Party nominee. Wisconsin Democratic Party communications director Courtney Beyer said their party has \"been the target of over 800 phishing attempts, with at least half of them seeking financial gains, all of which have been stopped and recorded in some form.\" Wisconsin Democrats have raised almost $59 million since 2019, while Republicans have raised nearly $24 million. The Wisconsin National Guard will be available to help communities that are short on poll workers, reports\u00a0Brewster.\u00a0Governor Tony Evers said about 400 Wisconsin National Guard members will be brought into active duty to support election officials as needed. Across the state there's a shortage of fewer than 200 poll workers, Wisconsin Elections Commission administrator Meagan Wolfe told reporters on Thursday. The National Guard has helped staff polling sites in Wisconsin's previous elections this year. More than 2,400 Wisconsin Guard members were mobilized during the April election. During a May special election, 160 members served as poll workers and 700 members were used to staff the polls in the August primary. Guard members can serve in traditional election worker roles or serve as greeters and help sanitize polling sites. Wisconsin has been dealing with a major spike in COVID-19 cases as Election Day nears. Evers said the Wisconsin Guard Members \"will be needed to ensure that election day goes smoothly and that voters and election officials alike have the assistance they need.\" Historic voter turnout continues to grow, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. Hawaii on Thursday became the first state to surpass their 2016 turnout with their 2020 early vote total. Hawaii is a universal vote by mail state - meaning all registered voters are mailed ballots. Per the U.S. Elections Project, 457,294 have voted so far, and 795,248 Hawaii residents have requested ballots. A total of 437, 664 people voted in 2016. Texas is nipping at their heels - early votes in the Lone Star State has totaled 94% of 2016 turnout. Other states that are working on approaching their 2016 totals in this early voting window: North Carolina (81% of 2016), Georgia (82%) and Florida (77%). A Michigan appeals court rejected Attorney General Dana Nessel's appeal of a lower court's decision that blocked Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson's ban on openly carrying firearms at polling places. According to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster, Nessel is appealing the decision to the Michigan Supreme Court. Benson issued the directive banning openly carrying firearms with 100 feet of polling sites earlier this month, saying it was designed to prevent voter intimidation. Open carry and gun rights activists filed lawsuits challenging the decision and on Tuesday, a lower court blocked Benson's directive. The state appeals court panel rejected the appeal, saying Michigan already has laws on the books about intimidating voters. \"Voter intimidation is -- and remains -- illegal under current Michigan law,\" the court wrote. \"Anyone who intimidates a voter in Michigan by brandishing a firearm (or, for that matter, by threatening with a knife, baseball bat, fist, or otherwise menacing behavior) is committing a felony under existing law, and that law is -- and remains -- enforceable by our Executive branch as well as local law enforcement.\" The three judges on the panel were all appointed by Republican governors and one of them is currently running for a seat on the Michigan Supreme Court. Some polling sites may be located at facilities that already ban or limit openly carrying firearms. A poll from the\u00a0Detroit News/WDIV-TV\u00a0released Wednesday night showed 73% of Michiganders supported the ban on openly carrying weapons at the polls. A U.S. District Court judge in Minnesota issued a preliminary injunction against private security firms, including Atlas Aegis, from placing armed security guards at polling locations in the state.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. The lawsuit was filed by the Council on American-Islamic Relations- Minnesota and the League of Women Voters of Minnesota. The groups alleged that the placing armed security guards at polling locations is a form a voter intimidation. Judge Nancy E. Brasel wrote that Atlas Aegis cannot deploy \"armed agents within 2,500 feet of Minnesota polling places or otherwise monitoring Minnesota polling places both during early in-person voting and on Election Day.\" In addition, Brasel wrote that the firms cannot threaten to deploy armed agents to polling locations in the state. NEVADA Testimony wrapped up Wednesday in the Trump campaign's hearing over ballot counting in Nevada's most populous county, after Republicans\u00a0had sought to\u00a0pause tabulation of early votes in Clark County over concerns of ballot mishandling and poll observers, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. The president's reelection bid and Nevada Republicans also this week filed suit against election officials over records they say the authorities have failed to disclose over processing votes and are demanding the identities of staff on the county's bipartisan counting boards. Democrats have repeatedly decried the GOP's flood of election litigation in Nevada,\u00a0accusing Mr. Trump\u00a0of seeking \"to sow distrust in Nevada's voting system because he knows he cannot win on merit.\" When asked about Mr. Trump\u00a0renewing his criticism\u00a0of the Democrat at a rally near the state's border this week, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak\u00a0said Wednesday, \"Sometimes he gets talking about things and I can't follow exactly where he's going.\" Sisolak added, \"I don't have anybody's ballots. I've never seen or found any ballots in a garbage can. And I think sometimes this is just exaggeration.\" Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced that the state has surpassed the statewide goal of recruiting more than 55,165 poll workers for Election Day. More than 56,000 Ohioans will serve as poll workers on Tuesday, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. While the statewide goal has been met, five counties - Ashtabula, Greene, Jackson, Pike, and Vinton - have still not met the poll worker recruitment goal for their counties. \"Ohioans are stepping up to serve as poll workers this election season at a pace never seen before, showing the world the civic engagement and can-do sense of public service our state has always exemplified,\" LaRose said in a statement. PENNSYLVANIA Americans may have to wait longer to find out who won Pennsylvania, since at least two counties in the state will not begin counting mail-in ballots until the day after the election, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Election officials in Cumberland and Butler, both Republican-heavy counties, say their staffs are simply too small to tally mail ballots while at the same time running Election Day operations. Under state law, it's legal for these counties to wait. They're allowed to open mail-in ballot envelopes, check signatures and scan ballots -- a process known as \"pre-canvassing\" -- on the morning of Election Day, but they must wait until polls close at 8 p.m. to report results. The decisions from Butler and Cumberland come as the nation adjusts its expectations on when it will know who won Pennsylvania, a state worth 20 electoral votes. In the state's primary, the first election in Pennsylvania that allowed any voter to vote by mail, some counties took two full weeks to tally their results. As a result, candidates in 10 races who were winning on primary day ended up losing after the votes were finally counted. Read more\u00a0here. Hudak\u00a0also reports that Pennsylvania's top elections official today told residents voting by mail that if they haven't already mailed their ballot back, they should return them in person if possible. \"We know the court rulings are confusing but there is one simple way to ensure your vote is counted,\" she said. \"Submit your ballot today. Hand-deliver your mail ballot as soon as possible to your county election office or authorized drop-off location no later than election day, and you can be certain that your vote will be counted.\" Over 3 million Pennsylvanians have applied to vote by mail in the first general election the state has held with no-excuse mail-in voting. The Board of Elections in Erie County, Pennsylvania, voted Wednesday to ban people from open carrying guns from meeting in groups near polling places or going within 100 feet of them if they aren't voting, according to\u00a0Hudak. The resolution was meant to prevent voter intimidation. Pennsylvania voters can legally enter in their polling places armed, and this is likely to face a legal challenge. This decision after the local paper\u00a0reported\u00a0in September that racist, threatening fliers about the election apparently from a white supremacist group were found in Erie driveways and after a pro-gun activist from Erie\u00a0told\u00a0the Post that Open Carry Pennsylvania will be monitoring the election. IN THE SENATE ARIZONA Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly has sued \"The National File\" for defamation in state court after the conservative outlet published yearbook photos they said depicted the Arizonan dressed as Adolf Hitler at a Halloween party decades ago, reports\u00a0CBS news campaign reporter Alex Tin. Kelly's campaign had released statements from several of Kelly's classmates at the Merchant Marine Academy rebutting the claim last weekend,\u00a0demanding the site\u00a0\"retract the defamatory statements.\"\u00a0In their filing, Kelly's attorney says, \"To disparage his reputation and harm his chances at winning the upcoming November election, Defendants have crossed a line.\" Incumbent Republican Senator Martha McSally has trailed Kelly for months, despite repeated attempts by Mr. Trump and fellow Republican senators to buoy her campaign in recent weeks. Kelly's campaign has suggested the story is part of that bid,\u00a0citing in their lawsuit\u00a0efforts by an alleged consultant for a GOP-aligned super PAC to probe the photos. IN THE HOUSE NEW MEXICO First-term Congresswoman Xochitl Torres-Small now numbers among a select few Democrats to have ever received an endorsement from the National Border Patrol Council, her campaign announcing the backing\u00a0late Wednesday\u00a0of the outspoken labor group representing Border Patrol agents. The union, which frequently backs conservative candidates and has repeatedly praised Mr. Trump, had initially endorsed Torres-Small's opponent\u00a0in 2018, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"She has been a voice fighting to put politics aside so that we can address the challenges on the ground, which is why we're endorsing her reelection campaign,\" Brandon Judd, president of the group, said in a statement.",

            "article_content": "All eyes are on Kentucky today as the state is expecting historic turnout for its primary despite the pandemic. A number of changes were made in the state to allow for an increase in absentee voting by mail after the primary was also delayed.\u00a0 In March, Democratic Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed an order postponing the state's May 19 primary to June 23 at the recommendation of the Republican secretary of state due to the coronavirus. In April, Beshear signed another\u00a0executive order\u00a0at the recommendation of the secretary of state for all Kentuckians to be able to vote by mail in the primary.\u00a0 The order also directed the State Board of Elections to create an online portal for voters to request that an absentee ballot be mailed to them, and postcards were also sent out reminding voters of the changes made this year.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says\u00a0more than 867,000 people requested absentee ballots for the primary according to the secretary of state's office, and as of Tuesday morning, more than 530,000 absentee ballots had been returned, with officials saying they expected more ballots to come in over the next few days as mail-in absentee ballots had to be postmarked by June 23. \u00a0 By comparison, in past elections an average of 1.5% of votes were cast absentee, signaling just how major the shift this year has been amid health concerns. Meanwhile, just over 110,000 people voted early in-person across the state. And as of 3:30pm Tuesday, more than 103,000 people had checked in at polling places in Kentucky, with polls still set to be open for several more hours, putting Kentucky easily on track to see more than one million people participate in the primary this year. \u00a0 Despite the record turnout projected, heading into primary day, the state faced some accusations of voter suppression as two of the state's biggest counties each had only one in-person polling location open amid health concerns and a shortage of poll workers. In Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, the Kentucky Exposition Center was being used Tuesday for in-person voting. And in Fayette County, which includes Lexington, Kroger Field was set up as the county's only in-person polling location. Officials noted both locations also had free transportation available to help get voters to the polls. While some voters reported waiting in longer than usual lines as of Tuesday afternoon to cast ballots including up to two hours, overall, reports on the ground show the process going relatively smoothly, as the vast majority of people opted to vote-by-mail this year.\u00a0 Kentucky officials note full election results will not be available Tuesday night due to the vast number of absentee ballots. County clerks must report their results to the Secretary of State's office by 6 p.m. on June 30. One of Tuesday night's primaries in Kentucky has received more attention than expected in recent weeks since State Representative Charles Booker has picked up steam against former Marine Amy McGrath in the Democratic Senate Primary,\u00a0report\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0and\u00a0CBS digital politics reporter Grace Segers. A spokesperson for Booker's campaign makes the case that while McGrath has higher name recognition than Booker from her run for a House seat in 2018, she lacks a passionate base of voters.\u00a0 The spokesperson also argued that McGrath is making a mistake by trying to appeal to more moderate voters, dismissing it as a strategy of \"pretend to be a lighter version of a Republican and hope that carries.\" Nonetheless, a McGrath spokesperson told CBS News that her campaign had three internal polls ending June 19 that all showed her leading the primary race by double digits. Meanwhile\u00a0several voters in New York City\u00a0faced polling location opening delays or incorrect ballots for Tuesday's primaries. In the backdrop is the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted more than 708,000 in the city to request absentee ballots, according to the New York City Board of Elections. The latest number in the days before the election showed almost 30,000 that had not yet received their ballot.\u00a0 Perry Grossman, a voting rights lawyer for the New York ACLU, did not receive an absentee ballot in time and had to go to in-person early voting. Grossman said one of the reasons for the delay in poll openings on Tuesday was the closure of the subways from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. ET, which the city's board of elections\u00a0warned voters about\u00a0on social media.\u00a0 \"About 15,000 of them can walk to the polls, but 13,000 got to travel. And I know there was some difficulty with the arrangements in getting people there on time,\" Grossman told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In addition to polling location hours, Grossman said he often ran into voters that didn't receive the complete ballot set for the presidential and the Congressional and local primaries. He said that was a problem that seemed to be getting better throughout the day, but \"certainly that's a thing we've heard a number of times from a number of places.\"\u00a0 Even before Tuesday, a staffer in Jamaal Bowman's campaign told\u00a0Navarro\u00a0it was running into problems with the Bronx Board of Elections in getting a correct list of sent absentee ballot votes and pending requests. They said the problem was unique to the Bronx, because it was able to get the information it needed from the Westchester Board of Elections. Grossman said while the city's board of elections has been dealing with an unprecedented situation of absentee ballots, he hopes any problems will be smoothed out by November. \u00a0 \"There's clearly some major, major faults that are being exposed. This is a massive stress test for elections nationally and probably New York in particular. And there are real faults in the system that we have to address,\" he said.\u00a0 Multiple longstanding Democrat House incumbents are facing progressive challengers in New York, the most vulnerable being 31-year incumbent Eliot Engel in the state's 16th district.\u00a0Jamaal Bowman is looking to capitalize\u00a0on recent momentum and unseat Engel, the current Chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. In Brooklyn's 9th district, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke has a rematch with Adam Bunkeddeko, who fell 6 points shy of beating her in 2018, though he has two other candidates to worry about splitting the vote with, including City Councilman Chaim Desutsch and Black Lives Matter activist Isaiah James. Carolyn Maloney, Chair of the House Oversight Committee, is also facing another familiar challenger in New York's 12th District. Lawyer Suraj Patel lost to Maloney by almost 20 points in 2018 and is running again. In the 14th District, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is facing a more moderate challenger with Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a former journalist that's backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Several open seats left by retiring House members are also worth watching Tuesday. Progressive\u00a0Democrats are hoping to prevent\u00a0Reverend and Councilman Ruben Diaz Sr. from winning the open seat in the 15th District in the South Bronx. Primaries in Nita Lowey's old seat in Rockland and Westchester County and Peter King's district in South Shore Long Island are both worth watching, too.\u00a0 FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN At his \"grassroots\" virtual fundraiser this evening, Joe Biden was joined by former President Obama \u2013 dressed in all black \u2013 and more than 175,000 online attendees,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. This was Obama and Biden's first official campaign event together. \u00a0 The event raised over $11 million in total, including $7.6 million from 175,000 grassroots donors, according to a campaign spokesman, the highest-earning event yet for Biden. The highlights were a few mostly mild lines of criticism from Mr. Obama directed at President Trump: \"We can't be complacent or smug or sense that somehow it's so obvious that this president hasn't done a good job because, look, he won once,\" Mr. Obama said about not underestimating the competitiveness of this election. \"I am here to say help is on the way if we do the work,\" Mr. Obama said of Biden.\u00a0 Mr. Obama said the election was \"serious business\" and said \"whatever you have done so far is not enough. I hold Michelle and my kids to that same standard. Whatever we have done to help Joe Biden get elected we have to do more.\" Addressing the ongoing pandemic, Mr. Obama draped Dr. Anthony Fauci in empathy. \"Poor, Dr. Fauci,\" the former president said, adding the doctor has to \"testify and have his advice flouted by the person he is working for.\"\u00a0 Toward the end, Mr. Obama also commented that dictators like Putin, Kim Jong Un and President Xi are watching the actions of Mr. Trump \u2014\"witnessing out of our White House ... a militarized response to peaceful demonstrators\"\u2014 and how he treats the press. They think they do not need to be held accountable, he said. At the end of the livestream, Obama and Biden bid adieu to each other:\u00a0 \"Love you Joe!\" Obama said. \"Love you too, pal,\" Biden replied.\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP President Trump's campaign announced Tuesday evening that it along with the Republican National Committee and joint fundraising committees, raised more than $10 million over the weekend of President Trump's rally in Tulsa. According to the campaign,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says most of the cash haul from Friday to Sunday came from online donors, which it states, \"further illustrates the intense grassroots enthusiasm behind President Trump's re-election.\"\u00a0 This comes as the Trump campaign and Biden campaign have gone back and forth online over who raised more, the former vice president with Mr. Obama with their event Tuesday or the Trump campaign with its rally over the weekend. \u00a0Last week, it was revealed that Mr. Biden, DNC and their joint fundraising committee brought in more than $80 million last month, while Mr. Trump, the RNC and their committees brought in a combined $74 million last month. Also on Tuesday Republican leaders in Arizona, including Gov. Doug Ducey and Sen. Martha McSally, joined the president for a stop at the U.S.-Mexico border as\u00a0the Trump administration has marked\u00a0completing more than 200 miles of their \"new border wall system.\" Mr. Trump told McSally at a roundtable with border officials and elected officials, \"We need you in Washington, would you please win?\"\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0reports the event kicked off the president's\u00a0second visit\u00a0since the start of the pandemic to a battleground state where his and McSally's polling numbers\u00a0have slumped\u00a0behind their Democratic rivals. President Trump is also slated to deliver on Tuesday an \"address to young Americans\" at an Arizona mega-church in Phoenix, where his supporters\u00a0began lining up overnight\u00a0outside.\u00a0 The group behind the event, Students for Trump, said it was\u00a0conducting COVID-19 tests\u00a0among staff and\u00a0told city officials\u00a0it planned to take some precautions, though that has done little to dampen criticism of an indoor event expected to attract thousands. Amid\u00a0record-high coronavirus hospitalizations\u00a0in the state, Phoenix was among several Arizona localities to mandate face masks earlier this month. However, the city's mayor conceded\u00a0over the weekend\u00a0that the president and event-goers would not be cited if they flouted the order while in Phoenix. Joe Biden denounced both stops in Arizona as \"a distraction\"\u00a0in a statement\u00a0labeling the president's decision to speak at the event in Phoenix as \"reckless and irresponsible.\"\u00a0 Kickstarting a \"Faith in America\" tour, Vice President Pence began his first campaign event of the summer with a visit to the Milwaukee area, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. He touted the Trump Administration's aggressive support for the School Choice Program, which gives \"underserved\" children access to private education instead of local public school systems.\u00a0 The current administration, led by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, has promoted school choice aggressively while expressing disdain for the traditional public school system. Critics of school choice programs argue using public funds to support choice schools undermines the public education system and could ultimately lead to the privatization of the K-12 system. After a roundtable where Pence reaffirmed his support for the school choice program and said it is an idea whose time has come, the vice president delivered remarks to a socially distanced group of supporters in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.\u00a0 Pence told the crowd the \"forgotten\" men and women of America are \"forgotten no more.\" He said the silent majority is silent no more and urged supporters to \"bring it\" again in 2020 for Trump. The vice president also touched on the contrast between the current and former administrations. Pence said the Obama administration presided over the slowest economic recovery in a hundred years and claimed that former Vice President Biden will raise taxes, increase regulations and \"get back to the old days of economic surrender to China.\"\u00a0 Meanwhile he said the Trump administration created more than 7 million jobs in the first three years. And repeating a line he's used for the last few weeks, Pence said there is no excuse for what happened to George Floyd, adding there is also no excuse for the looting and rioting. Pence said as the rioting and looting \"overwhelmed many of our major cities\" and that Biden \"sent out a press release\" while President Trump sent in the National Guard. \"We quelled the violence,\" Pence said.\u00a0 He added that the administration has been listening to law enforcement and the African-American community to look at ways of improving public safety. \"But we're not going to defund the police,\" Pence said to a cheering crowd. Pence also promised that vandals, like those who allegedly defaced St. John's Church in Washington D.C. or others who attempted to bring down a statue of former president Andrew Jackson, will be prosecuted to the \"fullest extent of the law.\" VEEPSTAKES KAREN BASS Add another name to Joe Biden's list of potential running mates:\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0was\u00a0first to report\u00a0today that Rep. Karen Bass, head of the Congressional Black Caucus, is also undergoing vetting by Biden's campaign. As head of the CBC, she is currently spearheading the police reform bill in the House and her previous experience seems just as fitting for this moment: before politics she was in the medical field and served as a physician assistant during the AIDS crisis. As speaker of the California Assembly, she received the Profile in Courage Award for navigating a path forward out of the state's financial crisis in 2009.\u00a0 Bass' vetting comes as pressure builds on Biden to pick a woman of color to join him on the ticket and after Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar withdrew her name from vice presidential consideration last week, also imploring Biden to pick a woman of color. There are now more than a half dozen women of color under consideration to join the White House ticket. CBS News recently reported that former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Representative Val Demings and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, are now being considered more seriously for the role than they were weeks prior. Others include Sen. Kamala Harris, Stacey Abrams, and Sen. Tammy Duckworth. An announcement has been previewed around August 1. CBS NEWS COVID CHRONICLES BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES IN FLORIDA CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the lives of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0In the latest edition,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0speaks\u00a0with Black business owners in Florida to discuss how they've adapted to keep their businesses alive, and what they're doing to economically recover amid the coronavirus pandemic. Ensure Financial Group in Lakeland, Florida was among a number of minority-owned businesses that took an economic hit when states shut down to mitigate the spread of the virus.\u00a0 Glenn Jones, chief executive officer of the insurance agency, said his team had to make quick adjustments to cushion the financial blow. \"We had to turn on a dime and say look, we're going to have to be more aggressive, more proactive, learn new ways through the digital Zooms and social media,\" said Jones. According to a McKinsey & Company survey conducted in May, more than 40% of minority-owned small businesses added new services to support their communities and employees during the pandemic. Jones and his daughter Jahlinda, the agency's chief operating officer, said EFG assured existing clientele and partnering businesses that the agency was still in a position to inform and serve, even as they digitally transitioned. In talks with various entrepreneurs,\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0also explored how the pandemic has highlighted systemic inequities that already existed for black and minority-owned businesses even before COVID-19. Donna Gambrell, the former director of the Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, said the full scope of the pandemic's impact on small Black-owned businesses is yet to be seen. She contended that the country will have a clearer picture when the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program closes at the end of June.\u00a0 \"As you see the amount of cash available that black businesses may have on hand start to run out \u2014 and them not having any other resources \u2014 I think that's where you're going to see some of the even more dire circumstances.\" The Florida Department of Health has confirmed more than 100,000 positive cases of COVID-19 throughout the state. A sobering reality for some Florida black-owned businesses that are just beginning to economically reboot. Dr. Fitzherbert Harry said his company, Harry Physical Therapy & Wellness, doesn't have \"millions in the bank,\" which leaves him uneasy about the future. \"There are some nights I don't sleep because I'm thinking, well, how can I support my employees? How can I help them to support their families?,\" said Harry. \"As a business owner, it's not just my responsibility to support myself. I have responsibility for my contractors, for my employees, for their families, because they depend on my funds to support their families...there's other people who depend on me.\" ISSUES THAT MATTER BLACK LIVES MATTER \u2013 THE PARTY? Forget Democrats and Republicans. Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET), says it's time for Black Lives Matter (BLM) to create an independent political party. In a memo to BLM, obtained by\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion, Johnson wrote: \"Many pundits will try to convince you that it is impossible for independent parties to exist in this country\u2026To the contrary, I believe a politically astute and structured Black independent party, committed and engaged in the electoral process, can prove them wrong.\"\u00a0 Johnson said BLM has mobilized people around the country on issues of racial and economic injustice \"in a manner not seen since the civil rights movement\" and encouraged the group to harness its forces. \u00a0The 74-year-old African-American entrepreneur noted the idea of creating a Black independent party is not new and suggested it be based on a founding principle of the Congressional Black Caucus which states: \"Black people have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies.\u2026just permanent interests.\" Johnson told CNBC Tuesday, \"I've been convinced for a long time that 40 million African-Americans who tend to vote as a bloc in one of the two parties limit their leverage in getting action from both parties.\" CBS News reached out to Black Lives Matter for comment. The organization released a new video Monday entitled \"Now We Transform\" and tweeted: \"Change is coming and together, we have work to do.\" BET Networks is a division of ViacomCBS. PROTECTING INCARCERATED DURING PANDEMIC Criminal justice nonprofit JustLeadershipUSA launched its #JustUs campaign Tuesday, calling on lawmakers to adopt a number of federal and state policy recommendations to protect incarcerated populations during natural disasters and emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. JLUSA, founded in 2014, aims to cut the prison population in the U.S. in half by 2030. The group, led by individuals who have themselves spent time in the criminal justice system, began addressing the impacts of COVID-19 on prison populations in March. JLUSA told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that a \"lack of response for this population\" amid the pandemic was the catalyst for this campaign, but that the group had been researching long before how to push for emergency response plans for incarcerated people.\u00a0 \"The American people received a COVID-19 relief package. The population currently incarcerated are the only American citizens who were left out of that. This is their COVID-19 relief package,\" said JLUSA President DeAnna Hoskins in an emailed statement. \"This campaign is necessary to bring attention to the lack and disregard for black and brown people incarcerated\u2026The total disregard for human life but the preservation of white supremacy by the release of someone like Michael Cohen, who was at a facility with no confirmed cases further entrenched the deserving and undeserving.\"\u00a0 The #JustUs campaign launches from 10 states including battlegrounds like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio. JLUSA said the locations were based on states with high numbers of COVID-19 cases and incarcerated people. The group is advocating for measures such as the creation of facility-based emergency plans \u2014 by a state's Department of Corrections or the Federal Bureau of Prisons \u2014 that outline in part, how correctional facilities will evacuate incarcerated populations during a declared emergency. The campaign also advises that policy should be put in place to empower correctional departments to be able to act \"without legislative or judicial intervention\" during a declared crisis or pandemic. \"Black Lives Matter no matter the mistakes in life they made,\" said Hoskins. \"Those who are currently incarcerated in the U.S. criminal justice system have been sentenced to serve time for the crimes they were convicted of committing.\u00a0 They were not sentenced to a death sentence.\"\u00a0 UP FOR DEBATE CHANGE IN SCENERY The second 2020 presidential debate is being moved from Michigan to Miami due to concerns about the coronavirus, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates\u00a0announced\u00a0on Tuesday that the October 15 debate will take place in Miami at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami Dade County. The debate was scheduled to take place at the University of Michigan, but the school sent a letter to the commission asking to withdraw from hosting the debate. On Monday night, two sources\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0that the school was expected to withdraw due to concerns about thousands of people coming to campus amid the pandemic. \"Given the scale and complexity of the work we are undertaking to help assure a safe and healthy fall for our students, faculty and staff and limited visitors \u2014 and in consideration of the public health guidelines in our state as well as advice from our own experts \u2014 we feel it is not feasible for us to safely host the presidential debate as planned,\" University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel wrote in a\u00a0letter\u00a0to the debate commission. The formal news of the debate relocation came a day after former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign told the debate commission that Biden intends to participate in the\u00a0three planned debates\u00a0and pressed for more information about how they would be conducted. Last week, President Trump said he was asking his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to lobby for a fourth in-person debate. The other two presidential debates will take place on September 29 at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana and October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville.",

            "article_content": "It's third-quarter filing day with the Federal Election Commission and fundraising numbers have been trickling in throughout the day, but this year has seen some records shattered. ActBlue, the online platform that Democrats use to raise funds, announced it brought in $1.5 billion in the third quarter of the year alone, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. That comes down to more than $10.8 million dollars a day over the course of 92 days. It's also nearly what ActBlue brought in across the entire 2018 midterm cycle. The record cash haul came from 6.8 million donors making 31.4 million donations. The average contribution was $47. In September alone, donors gave $758 million, which comes down to more than $25 million a day. ActBlue's largest fundraising date in history was in the wake of Justice Ginsburg's death when donors gave $70.6 million. Its greatest number of contributions in one day came on September 30th when 1.2 donations were made. WinRed, used by Republicans to raise funds online, also had a record quarter. It previously announced bringing in $623.5 million in the third quarter, an impressive sum for a platform that launched just last year. Its cash haul came from more than 11.65 million donations. The average donation through WinRed was $53. Its largest fundraising day to date was September 30, when it brought in more than $24.8 million in 24 hours. Joe Biden also shattered fundraising records in September after breaking records in August, giving the former vice president a substantial financial leg up in the final weeks of the 2020 campaign. The Biden campaign revealed it brought in $383 million last month, up from the $364.5 million raised in August by the campaign, Democratic National Committee and their joint fundraising committee. The Democratic presidential nominee has $432 million cash on hand, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a tweet. That's a massive war chest with less than three weeks until\u00a0Election\u00a0Day. The Trump campaign has not yet released its fundraising numbers. Read more about the cash haul\u00a0here. In his fourth rally post-COVID 19 treatment, President Trump dropped into the Tar Heel state on Thursday,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0writes. And while North Carolina began sending out absentee ballots on September 4, Thursday marked the first day of in-person early voting. \"The red wave is coming. The red wave is coming,\" Mr. Trump remarked. \"And remember, early voting starts. Guess when? Today. So get out there.\" Taking aim at Dr. Anthony Fauci, Mr. Trump claimed the Director of the NIAID is politically partisan. \"He's a nice guy so I keep him around, right? We keep him around. He's a Democrat. Everybody knows that.\" For his part, Fauci has repeatedly disputed claims of political partisanship having served under six White House administrations. GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also appeared at today's rally, 15 days after testing positive for COVID-19. \"She just fully recovered from COVID,\" Mr. Trump announced to supporters. Thursday marked Mr. Trump's ninth visit to North Carolina this year alone.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports Mr. Trump hit three of the state's largest media markets in September alone: Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham and Winston-Salem.\u00a0A poll published by the New York Times/Siena College\u00a0Wednesday shows Biden leading Mr. Trump 46% to 42%. Both presidential contenders will battle for TV viewers on Thursday night, appearing simultaneously on network news town halls instead of competing in their previously scheduled second debate. Mr. Trump will appear on NBC from Miami, while Biden takes the stage on ABC from Philadelphia. Vice President Mike Pence was also on the campaign trail again on Thursday, campaigning in Florida for the second time in seven days, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. Pence said Mr. Trump will be in the state on Thursday night, adding \"we are doubling up on South Florida.\" Pence talked about the Trump administration's support for Nicaragua, Colombia and Venezuela while attacking Biden for appeasing Raul Castro. On Nicaragua, Pence said the U.S. stood strong against President Daniel Ortega's \"brutalization of its citizens\" and promised the president will continue to call for fair and free elections in 2021 in Nicaragua. On Venezuela, Pence said he was proud America became the first nation to recognize Guaido as the country's legitimate leader. And on Colombia, he signaled that President Trump helped get former President Uribe Velez out of house arrest. He also reminded the audience that early voting in Florida starts on Monday and urged them to bring their friends, family, and neighbors along when they go to vote. Three individuals associated with the Biden campaign have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. Early Thursday the campaign announced that the Democratic vice presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris would be suspending her campaign travel until Sunday, October 18, because two people involved in the campaign, Harris' communications director Liz Allen and a non-staff flight crew member, have tested positive for COVID-19. Later in the day the campaign announced that an administrative member of the aviation company that charters Biden's aircraft has tested positive for COVID-19. Biden for President campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement that \"Vice President Biden was not in close contact, as defined by the CDC, with this individual at any time. In fact, the Vice President did not even have passing contact: this individual was over 50 feet from VP Biden at all times, entered and exited the aircraft from a rear entrance, and both the individual and the Vice President wore masks for the entire flight.\" The statement continued, \"Given these facts, we have been advised by the Vice President's doctor and the campaign's medical advisors that there is no need for the Vice President to quarantine.\" The person, who has not been named by the campaign, last traveled with Biden on a flight to Florida on Tuesday. According to the campaign this person was stationed in the last row of the plane, over 50 feet from Biden. The campaign announced that Biden last underwent testing for COVID-19 Wednesday night and tested negative. The two people who came into contact with Harris, including her staff member Liz Allen, both received their positive tests late Wednesday night. Harris, who was scheduled to campaign in North Carolina, wrote in a tweet, \"I will be transparent with you about any test results that I do receive.\" According to an aide with the campaign she underwent PCR testing for COVID-19 on Thursday, along with her husband Doug Emhoff. Both tested negative. Harris has had no in-person contact with Allen since October 8, when Harris traveled to Arizona to campaign with Biden the day after her debate with Pence. Allen, who has traveled with Harris on every campaign stop since Harris joined the ticket, was also in Arizona. It's unclear how close she was to Biden during the event. The campaign also tells CBS News that, on the flight back to Washington, D.C., Harris and the two individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 all wore N-95 masks, and Harris was \"not within six feet for more than 15 minutes with either of them.\" Harris and her staff took separate cars from Biden while they were in Arizona.

For the past two days, CBS News has been reporting on the allegations of Hunter Biden's laptop and deciphering the possible political motivations of the story that first ran in the New York Post on Wednesday. In\u00a0our new CBS News story,\u00a02020 campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News digital assistant managing editor for politics\u00a0Stefan Becket\u00a0write Mr. Trump and his allies have launched a late effort to again tarnish Biden by tying him to his son Hunter Biden's overseas business interests, publicizing emails and photos supposedly from a laptop alleged to have been abandoned by the younger Biden and timing their release in a manner reminiscent of Russia's efforts to dump damaging material about Hillary Clinton in 2016.Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, said his own attorney, Robert Costello, obtained the material from the owner of a computer repair shop in Wilmington, Delaware, after Hunter Biden allegedly left it there for months. Giuliani provided the material to the New York Post on Sunday, and the Post began running stories about the supposed documents this week. But the owner of the computer store, John Paul MacIsaac, was unable and unwilling to answer key questions about how the laptop supposedly arrived in his store, and eventually, how the data was shared with Giuliani. CBS News interviewed MacIsaac for almost two hours on Wednesday and throughout the interview he contradicted himself about his motivations, raising questions about the truthfulness of one of the central figures in the story. Questions about the existence of the laptop, details on the alleged documents in question, and context about the ongoing effort by foreign actors to spread misinformation can be found\u00a0here. Former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg announced 47 endorsements through his Win the Era PAC. Many of the endorsed candidates are running for state legislative races and nearly half of the candidates are under the age of 40 years old. In addition, some of the endorsed candidates are running in the battleground states of Florida, Michigan and North Carolina to flip state legislatures or to break Republican supermajorities in the states, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. \"We need to send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House, but we also need to elect good leaders at the state and local level,\" Buttigieg said. \"That's what this endorsement slate is about: making sure that we have forward-thinking, dynamic leaders at every level of our government who will deliver solutions to the biggest challenges we face.\" Erie County, at the northwestern tip of Pennsylvania, is one of three counties in the state that voted for Barack Obama twice before Donald Trump. It's a onetime manufacturing powerhouse that the president energized in 2016 by promising to bring back factory jobs. That helped him narrowly win a county Mr. Obama had carried by almost 20,000 votes in 2012. But since Mr. Trump took office, about 20,000 manufacturing jobs have left Erie. In a speech at a union training facility in Erie last week, Biden honed in on those struggles. \"Anyone who actually does an honest day's work sees him and his promises for what they are,\" he said. Verel Salmon, the chair of the county Republican Party, pushed back by telling\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0that Biden simply doesn't have the business credentials to help job growth in the region. \"The bottom line is the economy,\" he said. \"The ability of Mr. Biden and his family to benefit from the economy is clear, but in terms of running business of large scale, he doesn't have the credentials.\" Biden also incited alarm during a local television interview on his trip to the county by implying a massive locomotive plant in the area was considering shutting down, a claim the company vehemently denied. WICU-TV reported that the former vice president corrected himself off-camera after the interview, and Wabtec Corporation, which earlier this year purchased GE Transportation, quickly issued a statement saying that they have no plans of shutting down their plant in Erie that employs about 1,200 union workers. Salmon said the slip-up showed that Biden is uninformed about what's happening in the region. \"He shouldn't have come,\" he said. \"He lost more credibility than he had before,\" he said. Registered Republicans still trail Democrats by about 25,000 in the county, but the party has narrowed the margin by 5,000 registrations. Mr. Trump has not been to Erie yet this year but is expected to make a trip before the election. Facebook and Twitter took steps to curb the reach of a New York Post article alleging leaked emails show Joe Biden's son introduced the former vice president and democratic presidential nominee to a Ukrainian energy executive, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. The move sparked outrage among Republicans and raised questions about social network's fact-checking of political journalism. Senate Republicans announced Thursday they plan to subpoena Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. CBS News has not independently confirmed the contents of the New York Post article, and the Biden campaign has denied the report. \"We have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place,\" said Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman. Facebook and Twitter's injunctions were criticized by Mr. Trump and his reelection bid, who accused the social networks of interference in the 2020 election. \"I'll tell you what, he really is, he's a corrupt politician,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday about his political opponent. \"Just remember it. I'm gonna say it more and more. And Facebook and all can try and shut us down. But you know what? Everybody knows it, \" Mr. Trump said. \"For all of those tech oligarchs who think they can get away with this, I will simply say that winter is coming,\" Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Thursday on a Trump campaign call with reporters. Cotton urged Congress to seriously consider \"simply eliminating\" an important legal shield for tech companies under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Former consultants to Senator Bernie Sanders who helped organize a notable level of Latino voter turnout in Iowa are now going back into the Hawkeye State to whip up support for Biden and Iowa Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Theresa Greenfield, reports\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. America's Progressive Promise PAC - led by Jeff Weaver and Chuck Rocha, who helped run Sanders's presidential campaign - and Nuestro PAC, an outfit established by Rocha, are teaming up to spend about $500,000 to target Iowa's Latino voters with political mail and\u00a0digital ads\u00a0already airing in other more Latino-dominated states. The ad stars young former supporters of Sanders imploring fellow Democrats to vote for Biden. Currently, the CBS News Battleground Tracker shows Biden tied with Mr. Trump and Greenfield narrowly leading Republican Senator Joni Ernst. In February, Sanders won the popular vote in the Iowa caucus, but came up short to Buttigieg in the delegate count required to secure the presidential nomination. But one of Sanders's secret weapons was an intense and multimillion-dollar plan to seek out, register and turn out the roughly 68,000 Latino voters living in Iowa, predominantly in neighborhoods around Des Moines and Muscatine. Rocha explained the strategy to CBS News in February, saying that normally Latino voters aren't targeted by a major campaign until the final weeks before Election Day. \"Somebody Google translates some English ad into Spanish and that's their Latino outreach. You just can't do that, if you really want to get Latinos engaged, right?\" Now - yes, in the final weeks of a campaign - the two PACs are teaming up to send bilingual mailers to Latino households touting Biden and Greenfield. \"BOLD LEADERSHIP. NEW IDEAS,\" one flyer says in English. \"Liderazgo audaz. Ideas nuevas,\" it says in Spanish. In English and Spanish it adds, \"Our frontline heroes need someone who is \ufb01ghting for them. Our seniors need someone protecting their healthcare. Our students need someone \ufb01ghting to reform student loans.\" Will it work? In a tight race, it kind of did for Sanders. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced on Tuesday evening that early in person voting tripled in the first week compared to the same point in the 2016 general election, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. LaRose's office said in a press release that 193,021 Ohioans voted early in person in the first week and that Ohio's county boards of elections have received 2,470,268 absentee ballot applications. In Franklin County, which encompasses Columbus, 55,414 absentee ballots have been returned as the Franklin County Board of Elections mailed nearly 290,000 absentee ballots to people who requested one. In heavily Democratic Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections has processed over 320,000 absentee ballot applications and 36,635 ballots have been returned, as of October 14. More than 50 Wisconsin communities still looking for poll workers may get the National Guard's help to staff voting sites, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The Wisconsin Elections Commission said Thursday that 51 municipalities still have critical need for about 180 workers combined. Green Bay needs 30 workers, the highest number of any community in the state. During Wisconsin's April and August election, when there was a larger need for poll workers than there currently is, the state's National Guard members served as election workers. Governor Tony Evers said they would be available again. \"The National Guard will be there to make sure we have enough people working the polls,\" Evers said during a news conference on Thursday. WEC Administrator Meagan Wolfe said the state needs more than 30,000 poll workers to staff a general election and communities need more workers than ever to help process absentee ballots and staff in-person voting locations. Despite the shortage, Wolfe said the state is in a good position, but needs to prepare for potential surprises. \"I think we're in a really good place, but we never know what's around the corner,\" Wolfe said. Separately, Wolfe announced that Wisconsin currently has more than 3.6 million active registered voters. That's about 130,000 more registered voters than this point in 2016. 1.38 million Wisconsinites have requested absentee ballots for the general election and about 785,000 people have already voted. NEBRASKA The Washington Examiner in an\u00a0exclusive report published Thursday\u00a0detailed audio of a conference call Senator Ben Sasse had with his constituents in which Sasse says Mr. Trump \"kisses dictators' butts\" and mocks evangelicals. In a statement to\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson, a spokesperson for Sen. Sasse said, \"I don't know how many more times we can shout this: Even though the Beltway is obsessing exclusively about the presidential race, control of the Senate is ten times more important. The fragile Senate seats that will determine whether Democrats nuke the Senate are the races Ben cares about, the races he's working on, and the only races he's talking about. Just today, Senator Whitehouse was threatening court-packing in the Judiciary Committee simply because the Republican majority is going to confirm a Supreme Court nominee who steadfastly refuses to be a super-legislator. This is a civic crisis that is getting far too little attention.\" Sasse is up for reelection this November in Nebraska but is the favorite to win. Mr. Trump has endorsed Sasse and\u00a0praised the senator\u00a0for his work with veterans, the military, and crime on the border. Senator Sasse's office did not immediately respond to a question on whether or not the senator accepts the endorsement of Mr. Trump. GEORGIA Senator Kelly Loeffler received the endorsement of Marjorie Greene Taylor on Thursday, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Greene is running for Congress in Georgia's deep red 14th Congressional District and is a notable past supporter of QAnon. Loeffler is facing a jungle primary with 20 other candidates on the ballot for the special election to fill the remaining two years of Senator Johnny Isakson's term. Included on that list is Representative Doug Collins, who has been a fierce defender of Mr. Trump over the past year. CAMPAIGN CASH The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $70.5 million between July and September, bringing their total raised to $278 million and their cash on hand to $64 million. All are record highs for the committee at this point in the election cycle.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that incumbent Democrats in districts Trump won are also continuing to post high numbers, though some Republican challengers are also catching up.\u00a0Burgess Owens, the Republican candidate in Utah's 4th and featured speaker at the Republican National Convention, raised $2.7 million in the quarter. He's facing Congressman Ben McAdams in a district Trump won by almost 7 points.\u00a0Genevieve Collins, running in Texas' 32nd against Colin Allred, reported $2.02 million raised. Democrats challenging Republican incumbents are also raking it in.\u00a0Kara Eastman, a progressive Democrat running for a second time in Nebraska's 2nd, raised $1.8 million, just shy of doubling her Republican opponent\u00a0Don Bacon, who reported $977,017 raised. Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican running against Democrat incumbent Congressman Max Rose in New York's 11th district that spans south Brooklyn and Staten Island, raised $1.02 million. Rose's campaign says they doubled Malliotakis and raised $2 million in the quarter. The two had a\u00a0testy debate\u00a0Tuesday night, and at one point during a discussion about police and her time as a state senator, Malliotakis' mic was cut off by the moderator. One of her donors listed? James Dolan, owner of the New York Knicks NBA team, who\u00a0found offense\u00a0with Rose saying he should sell the team.\u00a0Navarro\u00a0reports\u00a0Dolan and at least four of his family members\u00a0donated $2,800 a piece to Malliotakis' campaign. Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker's communications director told\u00a0WCVB\u00a0in Boston the governor \"cannot support Donald Trump for president and is focused on seeing Massachusetts through the pandemic.\" A statement from the governor's communications director said, \"He'll leave the election analysis to the pundits.\" Baker joins GOP Governor Phil Scott of Vermont, who said in August he wouldn't vote for Mr. Trump. Neither have outright endorsed Biden. Baker has also often been referred to by Mr. Trump as a \"RINO\" (Republican In Name Only) by Mr. Trump, most recently on September 25 in a\u00a0tweet\u00a0about mail ballots. \"RINO Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts is unsuccessfully trying to defend Mail In Ballots, when there is fraud being found all over the place. Just look at some of the recent races, or the Trump Ballots in Pennsylvania that were thrown into the garbage. Wrong Charlie!\" Mr. Trump wrote. Baker is up for reelection in 2022. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has publicly disagreed with Trump regarding the coronavirus, did not vote for Trump in 2016 (he endorsed Chris Christie) and was once considering challenging him in the GOP primary. He said in\u00a0August\u00a0he hadn't made a decision on his vote this year.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that Hogan, seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2024, wrote in his book \"Still Standing\" that regardless of who wins in November, \"a large majority of Americans are thoroughly convinced that our political system is fundamentally broken.\" On 2024, he added that while the attention will turn there after the election, \"unless we begin to change the self-destructive course that both parties are on, this mess will likely just repeat itself.\" In the\u00a0first and only debate\u00a0in\u00a0North Carolina's gubernatorial race, incumbent Democratic Governor Roy Cooper and Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest clashed significantly on how to handle the pandemic going forward. After a decreasing positivity rate for most of the summer, the state is now seeing close to 1,900 cases a day, according to the latest data from the\u00a0CDC. This is close to the same rate the state saw in early July. Forest, who during the debate touted his background running an architectural firm, emphasized a need to loosen restrictions on businesses, curb the state's unemployment rate and reopen schools. He namechecked Tennessee and Georgia for their reopening process, saying, \"they're learning how to live with the virus and protect the vulnerable and get people back to work. They're learning how to do that. We have to learn how to do that in North Carolina, too.\" Cooper, who repeatedly said he'd prioritize public health first, pointed to Georgia's higher COVID infection and death rate. \"That's the kind of state you'd get with Dan Forest as governor: More cases, more deaths, more deaths in nursing homes. I don't think the people of North Carolina want that,\" Cooper said. Cooper also criticized Forest for continually holding in-person campaign events and not requiring masks, an attack reflected through his past ads. Forest said choosing to wear masks should be left up to the individual, and that, \"we don't need a governor that treats us like 5-year-olds. We need a governor that does protect us, but not treat us like we're little kids.\" He also pointed to debunked claims that masks don't work and cause \"more harm than good.\" \"Really, Dan? Really? Masks don't work? Scientists say they don't?\" Cooper responded with. \"That is just absolutely not true. You're finding that on the dark corners of the internet.\" While North Carolina has multiple competitive races on the ballot,\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says Cooper has consistently outpaced other Democrats in his polling leads. In the\u00a0latest New York Times/Siena College poll, Cooper holds a 14-point lead. Biden and Democratic Senate candidate Cal Cunningham hold a 4 point lead.",

            "article_content": "President Trump is headed to Sanford, Florida, on Monday for his first in-person campaign rally since contracting COVID-19. The president is slated to deliver remarks at an airport hangar at 7 p.m. ET, 12 days after he disclosed his COVID-19 diagnosis,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports. Mr. Trump also plans to address an outdoor crowd from the South Lawn balcony of the White House on Saturday. He's expected to make remarks on \"law and order\" in conjunction with an event that was already slated to take place with the conservative group Blexit, a White House official confirmed. Trump supporter and activist Candace Owens leads the group, according to\u00a0CBS News White House producer Fin Gomez. Mr. Trump and his physicians have so far not answered when he last tested negative for COVID-19 and have not said if he's tested negative yet. White House communications director Alyssa Farah told reporters on Friday that she did not have an answer on whether he has been tested recently or if he is currently negative. The White House on Thursday released a memo from Mr. Trump's physician saying that he believed the president will be able to return to \"public engagements\" as soon as Saturday. Hours after the memo was released, Mr. Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he was planning to hold a rally on Saturday in Florida. \"I think I'm gonna try doing a rally on Saturday night if we have enough time to put it together -- but we wanna do a rally, probably in Florida on Saturday night,\" the president said. \"We might come back and do one in Pennsylvania the following night, and it's incredible what's going on. I feel so good.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\u00a0people with COVID-19 remain contagious for 10 to 20 days\u00a0after their onset of symptoms, depending on the severity of the case,\u00a0CBS News White House producer Sara Cook\u00a0and\u00a0digital reporter Audrey McNamara\u00a0report. The president's personal physician Dr. Sean Conley wrote in a White House memo, released hours before Mr. Trump's own announcement, that Saturday will be 10 days since Mr. Trump's diagnosis, \"and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the President's safe return to public engagements at that time.\" The White House has said that the president began experiencing symptoms on Thursday, October 1, and tested positive that night. The next day, he was flown to Walter Reed Medical Center, where he received a combination of treatments. He returned to the White House Monday evening. The CDC says a person with COVID can safely end isolation if at least 10 days have passed since their first symptoms, plus if that person's fever has been gone for at least 24 hours and other symptoms are improving. The CDC adds a person can end isolation sooner if the person has received \"two negative tests results in a row, from tests done at least 24 hours apart.\" Mr. Trump told Hannity that he would be tested for the first time since his diagnosis on Friday. \"What we're doing is probably the test will be tomorrow, the actual test, because there's no reason to test all the time,\" he said in the Thursday interview. He said in a separate interview on Fox News Thursday that he thinks he's \"better,\" adding, \"to a point where I'd love to do a rally tonight.\" \"They are going to be testing him to determine the trajectory and whether he gets to the point where he's not infected,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, told\u00a0CBS News Radio White House correspondent Steven Portnoy\u00a0in an interview Friday. \"I can guarantee you that they will be testing him before they let him go out.\" Rutgers medical professor Dr. Bob Lahita told\u00a0CBSN\u00a0that if Mr. Trump were his patient he would still be in isolation on Saturday. \"He's talking about getting in front of thousands and thousands of people, and making a speech without a mask,\" Lahita said on\u00a0CBSN\u00a0Friday. \"This is an extraordinary display of behavior that's very unusual.\" Joe Biden made his first general election stop in Nevada on Friday as he encouraged voters in the state to take advantage of early voting starting soon. He then held a drive-in style campaign event with local politicians. Biden told the Nevadans gathered that Mr. Trump \"is trying to scare us\" by trying to \"convince people there are ways to play with the vote.\" To counteract the president's questioning the efficacy of the election, Biden said, \"We can't just win, we have to win overwhelmingly.\" Always a grandfatherly figure on the trail, Biden invited a 10-year-old boy at the event, who performed a lasso routine alongside a Mariachi band, to Washington. \"I got a couple people I'd like you to lasso,\" Biden\u00a0said. Biden's latest trip to Nevada marks the ninth battleground state the Democratic candidate has campaigned in person since June, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. The next debate between Mr. Trump and Biden has been officially canceled, the Commission on Presidential Debates said Friday.\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0reports officials with the nonpartisan entity responsible for organizing every televised debate between presidential contenders since 1988 began informing campaign officials Friday afternoon. Dakota County, located in Minnesota's second congressional district, encompasses the suburbs to the south of the Twin Cities metro area.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says Minnesota's second congressional district is a battleground as well, as Mr. Trump flipped the district in 2016 after former President Obama narrowly won the district in 2012. But there have been Democratic gains in Dakota County at large since 2012. Mr. Obama won the county by 3 points in 2012 and Hillary Clinton won the county by 4 points in 2016. There was a bigger shift in the 2018 midterms as then Democratic congressional candidate Angie Craig expanded Democratic margins, winning the county by nearly 11 points. Former President George W. Bush carried Dakota County twice. In 2020, Democrats are looking to increase their margins in the suburbs, while Republicans are focused on minimizing Democratic gains. Tyler Kistner, the Republican candidate challenging Craig in the second congressional district, recently released an ad pushing a law and order message, alleging that Craig supports the defund the police movement. During the summer and early fall, Republicans, including Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, have pushed a law and order message. Pence and Ivanka Trump recently attended a \"Cops for Trump\" event in Minneapolis. Democrats around the nation have focused on health care and the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a recent ad, titled \"Mom,\" Craig made a pitch to suburban families, tying her past employment to a health care message. \"I worked two jobs, too,\" Craig said. \"It's why I am fighting to make health care more affordable and lower prescription drug costs.\" The pro-Democrats Super PAC American Bridge 21st Century is teaming up with the progressive vote-by-mail organization Deliver Democracy to help educate Pennsylvania voters and make sure ballots are counted. To that end, they've announced a six figure \"It Takes Two\" digital campaign to remind voters in the keystone state to make sure to use both envelopes when mailing in ballots, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. In September, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that mailed so-called \"naked ballots,\" or mail-in ballots, returned without both an outside mailing envelope and inside privacy one would not count. This could result in an\u00a0estimated 100,000 ballots being rejected\u00a0in the general election by one Philadelphia elections official's estimate. American Bridge's new campaign aims to educate voters on the vote-by-mail process in the hopes of reducing the number of ballots being rejected due to their \"naked\" state. \"Donald Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,000 votes in 2016. With estimates showing more than double that number of mail in ballots at risk thanks to a recent court ruling, we must do everything we can to remind Pennsylvanians that it takes two envelopes to vote this year,\" said American Bridge 21st Century President Bradley Beychok in a statement. \"American Bridge 21st Century and Deliver Democracy will launch a massive voter education campaign targeting voters new to the mail ballot process to ensure their vote is counted.\" The \"It Takes Two\" digital campaign will utilize both social media and email to reach voters. \"How to get your mail-in ballot counted in PA: FIRST Seal your ballot inside the provided secrecy envelope. SECOND: Seal it inside the return envelope #ItTakesTwoPA,\" reads one example of an ad on Facebook. \"Young people and people of color disproportionately have their mail-in-ballots rejected more than any group in the country,\" said Paul Tencher, senior adviser to Deliver Democracy. He noted the path for Democrats winning the presidency and Senate has always been about turnout and a significant portion of that will now take place by mail. \"Together with American Bridge 21st Century we have launched a digital 'chase' program that will reach voters online rather than in the mail to make sure they send their ballot back with two envelopes.\" According to the Pennsylvania Department of State, more than 2.5 million people have requested mail-in ballots so far for the November 3 election. Of those, more than 1.6 million requests have come from registered Democrats while just over 620,700 have come from Republicans to date. In a 29-page order issued Friday morning, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker denied a preliminary injunction filed to extend the state's voter registration deadline after technical difficulties reportedly prevented thousands of eligible Floridians from being able to register before the initial deadline at 11:59 p.m. on October 5. Though the state extended the voter registration deadline for seven hours on October 6, Walker said in the order that the Secretary of State's \"cure\" for the website failure \"had at least one major flaw,\" which was that voters weren't informed of the new deadline until after noon on the date of the new deadline, which Walker said \"left less than seven hours for potential voters to somehow become aware of the news and ensure that they properly submitted their voter registration applications, all while also participating in their normal workday, school, family, and caregiving responsibilities.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the group of voting rights organizations that were plaintiffs calling for the voter registration deadline to be extended have released a few statements calling this latest string of events \"another episode in Florida's long history of voter suppression.\" In a statement Friday the plaintiffs said, \"From its efforts to thwart the will of Floridians in overturning racist felony disenfranchisement laws this year, to its failure to adequately update and address technical issues of its online voter registration system, one thing is clear: the state of Florida has consistently failed Florida voters.\" The statement continued. \"Moving forward, we will continue our commitment to ensure that all voters who were able to register will be protected during all voting periods.\" CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that on Friday, the North Carolina State Board of Elections issued a\u00a0memo\u00a0reminding voters that voter intimidation is prohibited in the state. In the memo, the board outlined a list of unlawful activities like distributing misleading information about the time, place, or date of an election, which is prohibited and in some cases punishable with prison time, fines or both. \"The State Board is committed to ensuring all voters have a safe voting experience, free from intimidation and harassment,\" said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the State Board of Elections in a press release statement. \"Regardless of political affiliation, every voter deserves to cast their ballot in peace.\" This announcement coincides with the last day of regular voter registration by mail or online for North Carolina voters and less than a week before in-person early voting begins in the state. Throughout the week, videos from celebrities like basketball superstar\u00a0Stephen Curry\u00a0and actor Zach Galifianakis -- who is a native of North Carolina -- have made the rounds on social media,\u00a0informing\u00a0North Carolinians on the ways they can register to vote in the upcoming election. As the\u00a0CBS News political unit\u00a0has previously\u00a0reported, the period for early voting and same-day registration in North Carolina is October 15-31. Absentee ballots received after 5 p.m. on Election Day will be counted only if they are postmarked on or before Election Day and received by mail no later than 5 p.m. on November 6. The Franklin County Board of Elections announced in a statement that 49,669 voters received an inaccurate ballot. The Board, who worked with its system vendor Bluecrest in correcting the issue, noted that they have begun the process of printing replacement ballots with the goal for these ballots to be sent to the United States Postal Service within 72 hours in order to be delivered to voters. In addition,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0reports the board will be mailing a postcard to impacted voters describing the problem and educating them on multiple options for them to cast their vote. For voters who do not wait for their replacement ballot, they can vote in person at the county board of elections. \"We want to make it clear that every voter who received an inaccurate ballot will receive a corrected ballot,\" the board said in a statement. \"Stringent tracking measures are in place to guarantee that a voter can only cast one vote.\" A judge on Friday rejected an effort from the Trump campaign to make Philadelphia's election officials let campaign representatives inside temporary elections offices to monitor for fraud as voters request, fill out and return ballots, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. The campaign last week filed a lawsuit after Philadelphia's commissioners refused to allow Trump campaign representatives to watch voters registering, filling out ballots and returning them at satellite elections offices. But in a 14-page opinion, Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court Judge Gary Glazer wrote that \"the very detailed Election Code contains no provision that expressly grants the Campaign and its representatives a right to serve as watchers at 'satellite offices' of the Board of Elections.\" The code does allow watchers at polling places, but Glazer wrote that the satellite offices fail to meet the geographic and temporal requirements to be considered polling places. Whereas the state Election Code describes polling places as voting rooms serving voters in an election district, satellite offices serve an entire county, Glaser wrote. Like the state's top elections official, Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar, Glaser interpreted the Election Code to consider polling places to be voting centers that are open on Election Day, not before it. The satellite offices are \"true offices of the Board of Elections,'\" Glaser wrote, and watchers therefore do not have a right to be present in them. Glaser encouraged the Trump campaign to accept the Philadelphia Elections Board's invitation to tour the offices. He also said campaign representatives can enter the offices to perform their own voting activities, but \"may not linger\" as poll watchers. Shortly after Glazer issued his order and opinion, lawyers for the Trump campaign filed a notice of appeal with the Commonwealth Court. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the only thing that could keep him from winning Pennsylvania is cheating from Democrats. In the presidential debate last week, he said his campaign's uncertified poll watchers had been kept from elections offices in Philadelphia, \"Because bad things happen in Philadelphia.\" Trump campaign spokesperson Samantha Zager echoed that sentiment in a statement about the ruling. \"What are they trying to hide?\" she asked. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who sued Mr. Trump's appointed postmaster general over mail delays ahead of the election, said the Glazer's decision should give voters confidence in the election. \"Today's ruling makes clear, yet again, that the president's wild claims don't hold up in the court of law,\" he said in a statement. NORTH CAROLINA Less than a month from Election Day as voters in the battleground state of North Carolina have begun casting their votes, both candidates in the state's competitive Senate race effectively shuttered their campaigns and had minimal campaign activity this week after Republican Senator Thom Tillis announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus and Democrat Cal Cunningham confirmed the authenticity of flirtatious text messages between Cunningham and a political strategist who is not his wife of almost 20 years.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0and\u00a0political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0report\u00a0that in the days after Tillis' positive coronavirus diagnosis and Cunningham's admission of an affair, North Carolina voters said while these new developments are \"shocking,\" they're sticking with their preferred candidate. \"Your personal life is your personal life. I think it's scummy, and it's the slum dog thing to do, especially like to his wife, but I also...don't think it's abnormal for politicians to cheat on their wives unfortunately,\" said Green Mountain resident Ivan Iventosch. But Tillis supporters don't think a COVID positive test is on the same playing field as an extramarital affair and remain staunchly supportive of their candidate, even more so now in the wake of the revelations of Cunningham's affair. Susan Mills, a school teacher in Fayetteville, North Carolina told CBS News that if Cunningham can lie to his own family, it makes her question whether or not he'd lie to North Carolinians. At least 10 battleground House races had debates last night, four of them in seats with incumbent Democrats, four with incumbent Republicans and two open seats, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Despite some of the debate issues staying local to a district (i.e. the border wall being discussed in Texas' 23rd), many of the topics discussed in the presidential and vice presidential debates such as the pandemic, the Affordable Care Act and the \"Green New Deal\" were mirrored in these down ballot races. \"I think that I am basically cut and paste into the Republican talking points that are happening across the country right now,\" New Jersey's 2nd Democratic candidate Amy Kennedy said at one point in her debate. In New Jersey, Republican incumbent Jeff Van Drew started to create a bit more daylight between himself and Mr. Trump, who he pledged \"undying loyalty\" to when he switched parties during the impeachment hearings. \"What it meant is I support the presidency, that I support some of the things that he's done about a strong America,\" Van Drew said about his prior comments about the president, referencing the nation's energy production and supply chain. Van Drew is facing Amy Kennedy, who was leading him by 5 points in a recent Monmouth University poll. In Texas 23rd, left open by retiring GOP Congressman Will Hurd, Republican candidate Tony Gonzales also clarified some space between him and Mr. Trump. When pressed by Democratic candidate Gina Ortiz Jones about Mr. Trump's disparaging remarks about veterans, calling them \"losers\" and \"suckers,\" Gonzales said he didn't appreciate the comments and that he doesn't always agree with the president. Health care was also a big contrast in this debate, as Gonzales repeatedly talked about protecting pre-existing conditions, while showing support for repealing the Affordable Care Act. \"I have a pre-existing condition. Why would I take that away from myself?\" Gonzales said. Republicans throughout the night were asked about pre-existing conditions, a mainstay campaign topic for House Democrats all cycle, and had to square away their support for it while Republicans still don't have a concrete plan for what to replace the ACA with. \"First, I do not support Medicare For All,\" incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Kendra Horn said during Oklahoma's 5th district debate. \"We do not need to throw out our system. But let's be clear, my grocery list has more details than your health care plan.\" Protests against police brutality were also brought up, used by Republicans to tie Democrats with the \"defund the police\" idea or a general anti-police sentiment. In Pennsylvania's 10th, arguably the battleground state's most competitive House race, Republican incumbent Scott Perry attacked Democrat Eugene DePasquale for marching with a group of protesters that had a sign that said \"Blue Lives Murder.\" Perry said, \"That's not looking for solutions, that's throwing gas on the fire.\" DePasquale responded and said showing support for the Black Lives Matter movement \"doesn't mean you're anti-anybody else.\" Congressman Perry was also asked about his \"No\" vote on a House resolution condemning QAnon, an extreme conspiracy theory network. Perry said it was a decision made on free speech. \"If you want to believe crazy things, unpleasant things, this is America. While I might find them objectionable, and I do, we have the right to believe in those things and to say those things,\" Perry said. Candidates across the districts found common ground in the need for passing another COVID stimulus package. Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks, running in Iowa's open 2nd district seat, said she was disappointed in the negotiations being delayed. Tiffany Shedd, running in Arizona's 1st district against incumbent Democrat Tom O'Halleran, turned to criticizing Speaker Nancy Pelosi's HEROES Act, saying \"it's got a bunch of pork in it...things that have nothing to do with the people of Arizona 1.\"",

            "article_content": "As campaign events nationwide are being cancelled, Tuesday's primary states have been signaling all week about how their approaches to COVID-19 and keeping the polls running on Election Day. Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio all have vote-by-mail or early vote options, usually framed as way of convenience to avoid long lines and avoid crowds.\u00a0 \"We weren't mentioning coronavirus specifically but we were strongly implying that that's one way if you wanted to avoid contact or whatever. As of today, we're being much more direct,\" Illinois State Board of Elections Public Information Officer Matt Dietrich told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0 Arizona has been promoting its curbside voting option, as well as making sure polling sites receive a full cleaning and disinfecting, especially in the 20 voting sites statewide that are in facilities frequented by seniors.\u00a0 \"We also want to remind voters to make a plan for participating in this election,\" Arizona Secretary of State Kate Hobbs said. \"Today is the last day we recommend people mail back their early ballots, and there are still several other early voting options available for those who want to avoid potential crowds on Election Day.\" In-person early voting is available in Arizona until Friday, March 13.\u00a0 In Florida, vote-by-mail ballots have to be received by no later than 7 p.m. on Election Day. The state also offers early voting in 67 counties until Saturday, March 14 \u2013 though officials note some counties may opt to add in more early-voting days. More than 204,000 Democrats have voted early so far.\u00a0 \"We are working with county supervisors of elections around the clock to guarantee that those votes count and that we ensure fair and accurate elections,\" said Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee.\u00a0 Ohio and Illinois have both been relocating vulnerable polling places, particularly those located at senior living facilities. The new Ohio locations include churches, school gyms and public buildings. The state also said there will be bipartisan teams of county board of elections officials to help seniors at these facilities vote without leaving the facility. In Illinois, the deadline to be sent a vote-by-mail ballot was Thursday. Dietrich said while the idea to extend this deadline was floated Wednesday, the state needed to be able to allow enough time for mail ballots to be returned.\u00a0 \"If they move the deadline to tomorrow, even on a Friday, it is doubtful that everybody would receive their ballots in time and essentially you'd have people who'd lose their right to vote because they're waiting at home for their ballot to arrive and it never comes,\" he said. Dietrich said that the state has already seen 12,000 more mail-in ballots returned than in 2016. Some 240,000 were sent out, and 65,000 have already come back this year. Illinois has also seen 272,000 early votes cast so far, more than the 246,000 they saw in 2016.\u00a0 \"Our message basically is to voters, if you're going to go out and early vote, if you're going to vote on Election Day, use the same kinds of precautions that these health agencies are telling you to use. You know, frequent hand washing, don't touch your face,\" he said. \"Message to voters, if you want to bring your own pen, feel free to do so.\" FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN \"The coronavirus does not have a political affiliation. It will infect Republicans and Democrats alike,\" Joe Biden said, addressing reporters from his native Wilmington, Delaware today. \"It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society.\"\u00a0 The former vice president, now the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, hoped to telegraph leadership, in contrast with the Trump administration's response to the spreading virus, which has shaken the markets and done little to calm the nation, says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson.\u00a0 \"This virus has laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,\" Biden said, reading from a teleprompter. \"Public fears are being compounded by a pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by his adversarial relationship with the truth.\"\u00a0 One of the biggest criticisms Biden aimed at the White House was that it had shown a \"colossal\" failure in planning, leadership, and execution of medical testings. In a detailed\u00a0new plan, Biden suggested ways the U.S. could be a global leader during this pandemic. He even suggested the Trump administration should take his ideas and implement them immediately.\u00a0 Biden's future campaign schedule is uncertain, with almost all public events going forward being taken on a day-by-day, state-by-state basis, according to sources inside the campaign. They've already canceled several events in Ohio, Illinois and Florida, and are currently scheduled to try a \"virtual\" town hall tomorrow with Illinoisans to spread the message.\u00a0 In a memo obtained by CBS News, the Biden campaign leadership instructed its employees to start working from home due to coronavirus, stating, \"The health and safety of our staff, supporters, and the general public is our number one priority. Separately, the Biden campaign named veteran Democratic operative Jen O'Malley Dillon as his campaign manager, report\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0and\u00a0managing editorial producer Jenna Gibson. O'Malley Dillon previously ran Beto O'Rourke's presidential campaigns. She will take over for Greg Schultz, who, according to a press release from the campaign this afternoon, is set to \"turn his focus to organizational planning for the general election and continuing to bolster the campaign's external outreach.\" \u00a0\u00a0 \"I am grateful to Greg for his leadership and hard work to help get our campaign where it is today, and I will value his continued input on this campaign,\" said Biden. \"I am also thrilled that Jen is bringing her considerable talent and insight to this team. She will be a tremendous asset to a campaign that is only growing and getting stronger as we prepare to take the fight to Donald Trump this fall.\" O'Malley Dillon was deputy campaign manager for President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign and served as executive director of the Democratic National Committee, responsible for day-to-day operations of the party apparatus. She's also a veteran of multiple mayoral, congressional, Senate and presidential elections.\u00a0 The hiring comes as Biden's team prepares to shift its focus to a general election matchup as Biden maintains a hefty lead in the delegate race over Bernie Sanders. A Biden campaign memo late Wednesday said that it expects to win at least 400 more delegates in primaries next Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio and hold a lead over Sanders of at least 150 delegates. Finally a congressional official tells\u00a0O'Keefe\u00a0and\u00a0CBS\u00a0News\u00a0producer\u00a0Rebecca\u00a0Kaplan\u00a0the Big Four Congressional leaders were notified today that the Biden campaign has submitted a formal request for Secret Service protection.\u00a0 Disposition of the matter expected soon.\" Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo said. \"We don't comment on security matters.\" BERNIE SANDERS Bernie Sanders spoke for 15 minutes today in Burlington and did not take questions from the press.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0says his wife,Jane Sanders, came into the room after her husband left and told reporters that Sanders plans to stay in D.C. after Sunday's debate to return to work in the Senate and deal with the coronavirus crisis.\u00a0 \"The American people deserve transparency, something that the current administration has fought day after day to stifle. In other words, we need to know what is happening right now in our country, in our states, and in fact all over the world. If there was ever a time for transparency and honesty and being straightforward, this is that moment. We need that information coming from credible, respected, scientific voices of which we have many in our own country and all over this world, not from politicians,\" he said. He added that Congress should come together in a bipartisan effort to respond to COVID19.\u00a0 Sanders used the address to criticize the Trump administration's response. Sanders called on the president to declare a national state of emergency. He also said he doesn't want the pandemic to make people feel isolated and that any response should be conducted with compassion and love. He also laid out his own solutions for the pandemic. Some were familiar, such as making a vaccine free, and prohibiting the pharmaceutical industry from drug price gauging. But there were a number of new elements added today, including expanding social programs like meals on wheels, free lunch, and SNAP to take care of the economically vulnerable; building emergency homeless shelters; placing an immediate moratorium on evictions, foreclosures, and utility shutoffs so that no one loses their home during this crisis. Medical residents and retired medical professionals should be given full access to treatment centers in order to handle an influx of patients, Sanders suggested. And members of the gig economy should be able to file for unemployment and provide emergency lending to small and medium sized businesses to cover payroll. Like Biden, Sanders is also instructing his staff to work from home. Communications director, Mike Casca, released a statement Thursday afternoon saying, \"In light of concerns about coronavirus and out of an abundance of caution for our staff, volunteers and supporters, the Sanders campaign has asked all staff to work from home and will no longer hold large events or door-to-door canvasses, instead moving to digital formats and outreach wherever possible.\" PRESIDENT TRUMP President Trump's reelection campaign released two statements following the public addresses Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders made on Thursday about handling the coronavirus, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0The campaign criticized Sanders for advocating for a government takeover of health care and for not considering closing down the borders to prevent the spread of the virus. After Biden's address, the Trump campaign immediately released a statement saying that America needs leadership like President Trump has demonstrated and Biden is not the leader it needs. UP FOR DEBATE CHANGE IN LOCATION Out of an abundance of caution and in an effort to reduce cross-country travel, the Democratic National Committee announced Thursday that it would be moving the 11th Democratic Presidential Debate scheduled for March 15 to Washington, D.C.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says it was originally scheduled to take place in Phoenix two days ahead of the state's March 17 primary.\u00a0 Also, Univision anchor and moderator Jorge Ramos has decided to step aside from participating in the upcoming debate. His decision came after Ramos disclosed he had been in close proximity with someone who had direct contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus. According to the DNC, Ramos and that person are both symptom-free but are not taking any chances.\u00a0 Univision News anchor Ilia Calderon will moderate the debate in his place. \u00a0\"Our number one priority has and will continue to be the safety of our staff, campaigns, and all those involved in the debate,\" read a statement released by DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa. On Tuesday, the DNC had already announced it would not have a live debate audience due to health concerns over larger groups of people gathering in close proximity. \u00a0Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are expected to be the only candidates qualifying for the upcoming debate. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE SENATE Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell canceled the scheduled Senate recess next week to work on bipartisan legislation to combat the coronavirus, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0McConnell's decision came after several senators including vulnerable incumbents like\u00a0Martha McSally\u00a0of Arizona,\u00a0Thom Tillis\u00a0of North Carolina, and\u00a0Susan Collins\u00a0of Maine called for recess to be canceled.\u00a0 The House of Representatives is expected to vote on a Coronavirus emergency funding package on Thursday night. McConnell told reporters Thursday afternoon that the Senate would \"take a look at whatever they send us.\" The Senate will respond next week to the potential package since Senators will not be working through the weekend. Senators Pat Toomey, Tom Cotton, Mitt Romney, Maria Cantwell, Ted Cruz, and Sherrod Brown are allowing their staffers to work from home. Senators Ted Cruz, Rick Scott, and Lindsey Graham have announced this week they are self-quarantining after proximity to infected individuals. PARTY PLANNING CONVENTION(AL) WISDOM The chairman of the Democratic National Committee\u00a0says\u00a0the party isn't looking into curtailing its July convention in Milwaukee or considering moving the large gathering online instead, reports\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe.\u00a0 \"No, we are working with our state and local partners, and I'm confident that we can work a plan that will enable us to have our convention,\" Perez told \"Axios on HBO\" for an interview airing Sunday, a portion of which was released today.\u00a0 As for a possible online convention, Perez said that would require a rules change and \"we're not contemplating rules changes, and I'm very confident that we're going to be able to carry it off.\" In a statement obtained by\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion, the DNC added, \"Ensuring the safety of convention attendees and local residents is\u2014and will always remain\u2014our top priority. Every convention necessitates developing a number of contingency plans to provide for a variety of scenarios. As we prepare to welcome Americans to Milwaukee this summer, the convention team will remain in constant communication with the local, state, and federal authorities responsible for protecting public health and security. We will continue to monitor this developing situation closely and follow the guidance of the CDC and state and local health officials in the days and weeks ahead.\" \u00a0 The Republican National Committee also commented on a potential contingency plan saying, \"The convention team is closely monitoring and coordinating with key stakeholders across the administration, HHS and CDC to obtain regular updates. We prioritize the health and safety of attendees and have the utmost confidence in the administration's work and preparations.\"",

            "article_content": "Johannesburg - Amnesty International has released a disturbing report into recent killings in Ethiopia's semi-autonomous region of Tigray. For over a week, there has been intense fighting in the state after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops there, accusing local officials of attacking a military base in the area. The human rights organization said it can confirm that scores and likely hundreds of people were stabbed or hacked to death in the town of Mai-Kadra in Tigray's South West Zone. The organization's Crisis Evidence Lab has digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers. \"We have confirmed the massacre of a very large number of civilians, who appear to have been day labourers in no way involved in the ongoing military offensive. This is a horrific tragedy whose true extent only time will tell as communication in Tigray remains shut down,\" Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's director for East and Southern Africa, said in a statement. Most of the dead bodies were found in the town's center near the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and along a road that exits to the neighboring town of Humera, according to the witnesses and verified images. People who saw the dead bodies told Amnesty International that they had gaping wounds that appear to have been inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes. Those reports have been confirmed by an independent pathologist commissioned by the human rights group. Witnesses said there were no signs of gunshot wounds. \"Those wounded told me they were attacked with machetes, axes and knives. You can also tell from the wounds that those who died were attacked by sharp objects. It is horrible and I am really sad that I witnessed this in my life,\" one distraught witness said. Amnesty International has not yet been able to confirm who was responsible for the killings. Witnesses told the organization forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front, which rules Tigray, were responsible, apparently carrying out the massacre after suffering defeat from the government's forces in another part of the state. After defeating the Tigray forces, the government troops spent the night on the outskirts of Mai-Kadra town. \"When we entered, we saw a lot of dead bodies, soaked in blood, on the streets and rental dormitories frequented by seasonal workers. The view was really debasing, and I am still in shock struggling to cope with the experience,\" a civilian who entered the town after it was retaken by government forces told Amnesty International. Tensions between Abiy, the prime minister, have been simmering for months now. Last Wednesday, while the world was anxiously waiting for the results of the U.S. presidential election, Abiy was sending national soldiers to Tigray in response to an alleged attack by regional troops on a government military base in the area. There has been a communications blackout, so there is no independent verification of the attack. Abiy came to power on an ambitious reform agenda attempting to transform what was one of Africa's most repressive countries and rooting out corruption. But the Tigray People's Liberation Front, or TPLF, believe they have been unfairly targeted by this anti-corruption drive with many senior national government representatives losing key posts. The tipping point came in September when Abiy postponed parliamentary elections due to the coronavirus. Tigray leaders said this was a ploy by Abiy to mount a power grab. They defied the ban and went ahead with their own elections. Arrest warrants have been issued for Tigray's president, Debretsion Gebremichael, who was elected in September, and other TPLF leaders \"for endangering the country's existence\" and \"for trying to erode the constitution.\" On Friday, Ethiopia's parliament appointed a new head of Tigray, Mulu Nega, an education official. The situation in Ethiopia has deteriorated rapidly and is all the more alarming considering that just last year Abiy received the Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decades-old conflict with neighboring Eritrea. The man who was able to make peace internationally has been unable to do so within his own borders. During his acceptance speech for the peace prize, Abiy said war was the epitome of hell, and now he seems prepared to unleash that hell on his own country. Although Tigrayans only make up about 6% of the population of 110 million, they have been the dominant political and economic force in Ethiopia, enjoying a disproportionate level of power. Abiy comes from the majority ethnic group, the Oromo. The TPLF helped overthrow the military dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam and was the leading group in the power-sharing government that followed. Abiy's critics say that sidelining the Tigrayans was a huge mistake in a deeply polarized country and there are now fears that Ethiopia could fracture once and for all along ethnic lines into all-out civil war.",

            "article_content": "Democrats will be going to Milwaukee for a convention this summer, but it will be\u00a0greatly scaled down in size, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Convention delegates who would normally fill an arena to cheer on Joe Biden as he accepts the Democratic presidential nomination are being instructed not to make plans to travel to Milwaukee and are being told they should conduct their business remotely, the Democratic National Convention Committee said. Some members of those delegations are still expected to make the trip to Wisconsin, but the details of who and how many delegates from each state are yet to be determined.\u00a0 The event is also moving from the Fiserv Forum, home of the Milwaukee Bucks, to the Wisconsin Center, a convention center in downtown Milwaukee. The Democrats are planning for their convention to feature four nights of programming, starting on August 17, which will be anchored from Milwaukee. Each night will feature live broadcasts from Milwaukee along with \"curated content\" from Milwaukee and other satellite cities, locations and landmarks around the country that will be announced at a later date.\u00a0 Former Vice President Joe Biden intends to accept the Democratic nomination in Milwaukee. \"This will be a convention for all Americans who wish to join our mission to win the battle for the soul of this nation and build a fairer, more united country for us all,\" Jen O'Malley Dillon, Biden's campaign manager, said in a statement Wednesday. The DNCC says all large-scale gatherings around the convention, such as welcome events and fundraisers, are canceled. The standing committees of the convention including the platform, credentials, and rules committees will conduct their business virtually.\u00a0 In April, Democrats decided to\u00a0postpone the convention\u00a0from July to August to allow for more time to make contingency plans if the coronavirus still prevented mass gatherings. The committee has hired two experts in epidemiology and infectious diseases to advise the party about public health. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign is building out its operation in the key battleground state of Wisconsin. On Wednesday, the Biden campaign announced it has hired four senior staffers for its operation in the state, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Scott Spector, who managed Senator Tammy Baldwin's 2018 re-election campaign, will serve as senior adviser. Danielle Melfi, another Baldwin 2018 alum who was working for Governor Tony Evers' administration, will be the state director. Baldwin won re-election in 2018 by a 10-point margin. Garren Randolph, who worked for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and was Evers' political director, will serve as the deputy state director and Shirley Ellis, a longtime political aide to Rep. Gwen Moore, will be the strategic adviser for Milwaukee.\u00a0 The Biden campaign's Wisconsin headquarters will be in Milwaukee, a city that saw decreased turnout in 2016 compared to 2012. During a strategy briefing last month, the Biden campaign said it would have staffers physically in the battleground states in June and announced staff hirings in Arizona last week. The news comes as a new\u00a0Marquette University Law School\u00a0poll released on Wednesday shows Biden leading President Trump in the state 49% to 41% among registered voters. The previous two Marquette polls, in May and March, showed Biden up 3 points, and the two were tied in February.\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP Following months without an overseas guest, President Trump greeted Poland's nationalist president Andrzej Duda just four days before his visitor's own competitive re-election contest. The return to a normalcy, or at least, a normal schedule of events, coincides with the White House's push to reopen the American economy amid a second surge of new coronavirus cases nationwide, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0 In a Rose Garden briefing alongside President Duda, Mr. Trump touted the country's \"record on crime,\" as the GOP's police reform bill stalled in the Senate Tuesday, following Democrats' vote to block debate on the JUSTICE Act. After weeks of protests against racial injustice and police brutality, Mr. Trump doubled down on his support of law enforcement and singled out Chicago and Detroit for high rates of crime.\u00a0 \"We have one city \u2014 or two cities in particular, worse than Honduras,\" the president interjected. \"Worse than Afghanistan. Worse than Afghanistan. And these are cities within the United States.\" In the wake of Monday night's attempts to topple a statue of President Andrew Jackson \u2014 a slave owner who forcefully relocated thousands of Native Americans during his presidency \u2013 Mr. Trump said the White House would put forth a \"very, very, very powerful\" executive order protecting monuments and statues by the end of the week. The president's re-election campaign is expanding its legal footprint, filing a defamation lawsuit against Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action for their advertisement alleging the president called the coronavirus outbreak a \"new hoax.\" In the 30-second spot featuring spliced audio from the president's February 28 rally in North Charleston, South Carolina, Trump says, \"The coronavirus\u2014this is their new hoax.\"\u00a0 In his speech, the president criticized the Democratic response and media coverage surrounding his administration's pandemic response, not the virus itself. \"The American people should be able to trust in the accuracy of the content aired, especially in reference to their president,\" Jenna Ellis, senior legal adviser the Trump campaign wrote in a statement. Today's legal challenge builds on a previous defamation lawsuit against Wisconsin television station WJFW-NBC, which ran the advertisement after a cease-and-desist letter from the Trump campaign. \"We stand by the facts in our ad that uses Trump's own words,\" Guy Cecil, Chairman of Priorities USA said in a statement. \"We won't back down from holding Trump accountable for failing America.\" AD WARS PAC ATTACK The pro-Biden Super PAC Unite the Country released three new ads highlighting the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee's economic accomplishments as the country faces new hardship stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says the television and digital ads are part of a $10 million pre-convention campaign by the PAC and will target swing voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\u00a0 The 30-second television spot titled \"Through this Before\" focuses on the recovery from the Great Recession. \"Then-Vice President Joe Biden oversaw the 2009 Recovery Act,\" says the narrator in the ad that first aired Wednesday morning in Michigan. It goes on to tout 14 million jobs created, the auto industry rescued, and the longest sustained job growth in U.S. history. The ad says at the end, \"He's done it before, he'll do it again.\"\u00a0 Another digital ad titled \"Never Quit\" features Biden speaking about his father, who would say, \"Champ, when you get knocked down, get up.\" It goes on to Biden saying, \"You never quit on America, and you deserve a president who will never quit on you.\" The other digital ad, called \"Recovery,\" focuses on the \"top five things you need to know\" about the recovery in 2009 and Biden's role in it. \u00a0While other groups have gone negative on President Trump, Unite the Country takes a positive approach highlighting Biden's record and has been advocating for Biden since before the first primaries took place in October 2019. Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee's latest ad \"Played\" aired for the first time in Washington, D.C., according to Kantar/CMAG tracking. In it, the narrator says, \"Trump said he'd get tough on China.\" It goes on to claim \"he didn't get tough, he got played\" and that Mr. Trump lost the trade war.\u00a0 The DNC Wednesday will also be releasing a Pennsylvania-specific version of the ad which will highlight the impact of the president's trade policies on workers and farmers in the battleground state. It's part of a new push to highlight the President's record on trade and China nationally and in key states. The DNC says the ad will run in Pittsburgh as part of their six-figure campaign over five weeks to hold Mr. Trump accountable. ISSUES THAT MATTER ELECTION FRAUD CLAIMS As election officials from both parties are scaling up their vote by mail operations ahead of November's election, the president and the attorney general are making unverified claims that foreign actors could tamper with those ballots,\u00a0CBSN political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0report.\u00a0 Election officials and experts say a complicated and detailed set of safeguards in place are expressly designed to detect and prevent such interference. \"You would have to reproduce the entire election administration apparatus somewhere in the middle of Siberia,\" says Charles Stewart, the founding director of the Election Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u00a0 Tina Barton, a Republican who serves as the clerk in Rochester Hills, Michigan, said her city's ballots are printed by one company, have a unique ballot number for each voter, include a barcode that can bring up a voter's record and are programmed to be compatible with the city's counting machines. Beyond those steps, the envelopes for mailing the ballot, the secrecy sleeve and ballot instructions are all standardized, making it even more difficult to mimic the mailing. Cases of fraud are very rare and have consequences. According to the Heritage Foundation's database of fraud cases, there have been only about 200 cases from absentee fraud in all states in their database with various penalties for perpetrators. VOTE-BY-MAIL Both state and national Republicans, including President Trump's campaign,\u00a0are asking a federal court\u00a0to intervene as defendants in the lawsuit\u00a0brought by state and national Democrats\u00a0challenging Arizona's policy of rejecting unsigned mail ballots without a \"cure period.\"\u00a0 Both\u00a0Republicans\u00a0and\u00a0Democrats\u00a0have boasted of swelling litigation budgets this year, waging court battles over election changes in several swing states, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \u00a0 \"This filing represents yet another instance where the Trump campaign is directly fighting to stop Democrat attempts to undermine election integrity and to protect the sanctity of the vote for citizens of Arizona and all Americans,\" Jenna Ellis, senior legal adviser to the president's campaign,\u00a0said in a statement.\u00a0 In neighboring Nevada, where a shift to an all-mail primary triggered legal fights from both sides of the aisle, Deputy Secretary of State Wayne Thorley said roughly half of the 12,366 mail ballots rejected statewide over signature issues \u2013 5,617 ballots, or a little more than one percent of all votes \u2013 were \"cured\" by voters and counted. POLLING THE ROOM GOP VS. DEMS An\u00a0internal poll\u00a0by the National Republican Congressional Committee in battleground districts showed that a generic Republican has a one-point advantage over a generic Democratic candidate. The poll, fielded among 1,014 swing voters, found that the top concern was the economy, with 23%. Followed by that is \"corruption in Washington\" at 20% and healthcare (a top issue that House Democrats are running on) at 11%. On the recent protests,\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says the poll found that 51% of swing voters support the protests, though 59% do not support the movement of defunding police departments. About 10% of voters said the coronavirus was a top concern, and the poll found that eight out of 10 voters agreed China \"deserves at least some of the blame\" in the coronavirus outbreak. RINGING ENDORSEMENTS FARM TO VOTE With the unanimous support of their elected member leadership, the executive board of the United Farm Workers voted Tuesday to formally endorse Joe Biden. The labor group had\u00a0first backed\u00a0California Sen. Kamala Harris in November, during the primaries, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. While federal law\u00a0excludes agricultural workers\u00a0from the National Labor Relations Act, the union counts thousands among its supporters across some of the key swing states. Among them, the union says some 2,000 \"farm workers and activists\" are active with them in the battleground state of Arizona, where the union traces\u00a0its earliest days: co-founder Cesar Chavez was born in the Arizona town of Yuma, a border community which today\u00a0counts the highest concentration\u00a0of agricultural workers of all metropolitan areas outside of California.\u00a0 In 2016, Donald Trump narrowly won Yuma County\u00a0by one point. \"Elections matter. There are 132 days before the next election. The UFW will spend every one of those days making sure people vote,\" Teresa Romero, president of the union, said Wednesday\u00a0in a statement. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE NEW YORK It was a big night for minority progressive candidates in New York on Tuesday. Jamaal Bowman and Suraj Patel could topple two long-time House Democrat incumbents that chair committees. And in two open seats, Ritchie Torres and Mondaire Jones are set to make history and become the first LGBTQ black men to serve in Congress.\u00a0 \"When you put these wins together with other wins, what you come up with is a requirement for the Democratic leadership to concede some of their power and to make significant and specific commitments to the new progressives. Why? Because if they want to win and need a turnout, they need to. They can't just rely on the same groups of people to win elections,\" New York political consultant Hank Sheinkopf told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0 However, full results are still pending. According to a state mandate, absentee ballots will start being counted one week after election day. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, this is a larger number than usual with about 1.92 million absentee ballots requested according to the State Board of Elections.\u00a0Navarro\u00a0has\u00a0more\u00a0on where things stand so far in the competitive primaries below: NY-16 (North Bronx, parts of Westchester County):\u00a0Jamaal Bowman\u00a0is leading big against\u00a031-year incumbent Eliot Engel, and his campaign claimed victory\u00a0Wednesday morning. In a release, they pointed to the 62% to 35% lead Bowman has, and said it's a gap that \"would be nearly impossible\" for Engel to overcome. Engel's camp said\u00a0Tuesday night\u00a0they'd be waiting for the absentee ballot count before calling the race, and campaign manager Tom Watson said Wednesday \"any declarative statement on the outcome\"\u00a0 is \"premature and undermines the democratic process.\" Regardless, Bowman's showing is a strong sign for progressive groups like the Working Families Party and the Justice Democrats, who recruited and backed him. And if Bowman's lead holds after the absentee ballots are counted, Engel would be the second House Democrat to lose his or her primary this cycle (the first being Dan Lipinski in Illinois' 3rd district).\u00a0 NY-12 (East Manhattan, parts of Queens & Brooklyn):\u00a0House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney is winning by less than 2 percent against Attorney Suraj Patel. In 2018, Maloney beat Patel by 20 points but this cycle, she's losing to him in Queens & Brooklyn and winning by less than 10 points in Manhattan. In an election night statement, Patel was confident the absentee count would bring him to victory. But one thing to watch is how many absentee ballots come out of the wealthier parts of Manhattan, as this could benefit Maloney, since\u00a0many of these residents leaving town\u00a0at the beginning of the pandemic.\u00a0According\u00a0to the city board of elections, there are at least 78,919 distributed absentee ballots in the Manhattan part of the district. Patel is currently down 648 votes.\u00a0 NY-15 (South Bronx) & NY-17 (Lower Hudson Valley, parts of Rockland and Westchester County):\u00a0In Congressman Jose Serrano's open seat in the South Bronx, City Councilman Ritchie Torres is handily winning the Democratic primary. He is beating Ruben Diaz Sr., a\u00a0controversial pastor\u00a0that previously invited Trump to his church. Torres was endorsed by the New York Times and benefitted from outside interest in this race from groups like the Voter Protection Project. In the 17th, lawyer Mondaire Jones is leading by more than 20% in the race for Congresswoman Nita Lowey's old seat. With both of their districts being safely Democratic, Torres and Jones are poised to become the first two openly gay black men to serve in Congress.\u00a0 NY-27 (Between Buffalo & Rochester):\u00a0Republican State Senator Chris Jacobs won both the primary and special election to fill Chris Collins' seat. Collins resigned and was\u00a0sentenced for insider training earlier this year. Jacobs bested Democrat Nate McMurray, who lost narrowly to Collins in 2018. The\u00a0AP called this race\u00a0late Tuesday, though McMurray\u00a0has been vocal about waiting\u00a0for the absentee count first. He's\u00a0down\u00a0by more than 30 points.\u00a0 NORTH CAROLINA 24-year-old\u00a0Republican Madison Cawthorn\u00a0has won the Republican runoff in Mark Meadows' old North Carolina seat, beating Lynda Bennett. Bennett was backed by Trump and Meadows, and is friends with Meadow's wife, Debbie. Despite recently redrawn maps, the 11th District is expected to stay Republican, according to\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. If Cawthorn is elected, he would be 25 years old when he enters Congress and would be the youngest member of Congress. In a victory statement\u00a0posted on Facebook\u00a0Tuesday, Cawthorn said the election's outcome wasn't a rebuke of the president.\u00a0 \"I want to make something clear: I support our great president,\" Cawthorn wrote. \"I do not believe this election has been a referendum on the president's influence. The people of western North Carolina are wise and discerning. You observed both candidates and simply made the choice you believed is best for our district.\"\u00a0 IN THE SENATE ARKANSAS Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas launched an attack ad against Joe Biden on Wednesday, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The ad criticizes Biden for not speaking out against those who want to tear down statues and government buildings. Cotton's political action committee is running the ad digitally in Minnesota because Minnesota is where a police precinct was burned down in the wake of George Floyd's death. Cotton also launched an ad in March criticizing Biden as soft on China. Cotton is running for reelection in Arkansas, but he does not have a Democratic opponent, since the sole candidate withdrew after the filing deadline. Cotton is considered a potential Republican candidate for president in 2024. \u00a0",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, as the West Coast struggles to beat back devastating fires in a COVID-complicated world, the candidates enter the final phase of campaign 2020. Saturday in Las Vegas, it was the voters who were off and running to see President Trump in person. Mostly maskless and not doing much social distancing. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: My people go out and vote. There's no suppression. MARGARET BRENNAN: Both former Vice President Joe Biden and Mister Trump have picked up the pace of their campaign travel, but most voters already know who they're voting for, and the focus is changing to how. President Trump says the only way he'll lose is if Democrats rig the election. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: People died and they're getting ballots. They're sending them to dogs. You see that? Dogs got ballot. Everybody's getting ballots. Probably everybody but Republican are going to get the ballots, right? MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with the former deputy director of National Intelligence Sue Gordon about election security. What impact will the President's handling of the pandemic had in key battleground states? Journalist Bob Woodward's bombshell book and audiotapes of President Trump reveal he knew how dangerous the virus was in early February but he did not level with the American people. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (February 7/Washington Post): It goes through air, Bob. That's always tougher than the touch. It's also more deadly than even your, you know, your-- strenuous flus. This is deadly stuff. (February 23, 2020): We have it very much under control. (February 26, 2020): You treat this like a flu. (March 30, 2020): Stay calm. It will go away. JOE BIDEN: He knew how deadly it was. It was much more deadly than the flu. He knew and purposely played it down. Worse, he lied to the American people. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll get an update on the fires from Oregon Governor Kate Brown, where officials warn of a potential mass fatality incident as they search for survivors. Plus, in our continuing coverage of the impact of COVID-19, we'll speak with the head of Pfizer. One pharmaceutical company hard at work on a vaccine. And we'll hear from former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. And the CEO of United Airlines about the financial future of the airline industry. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Across America challenging times continue as we head into the final fifty-day stretch before Election Day. But this Sunday morning, no threat is more imminent than what is happening on the West Coast. With at least thirty-three dead and dozens more missing. There are sixty-two large fires burning in California, Oregon, and Washington state. More than five million acres have burned. Thousands of homes have been destroyed, and, once again, the hardest hit are the underserved communities. We begin this morning with Oregon's governor, Kate Brown, joining us from her home in Salem. Good morning to you, Governor. GOVERNOR KATE BROWN (D-Oregon/@OregonGovBrown): Good morning. Thank you so much for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have seen reports that at least ten people have died, dozens are missing. State officials are-- are warning of a potential mass fatality event. When will you have these fires under control? GOVERNOR KATE BROWN: Well, the good news is that the weather has stabilized. Just to give your viewers a perspective about what's happening on the ground about every year for the last ten years, we burn about five hundred thousand acres. This year, this week alone, we've burned over a million acres of beautiful Oregon. We've got fires on the coast. We got fires in communities right abutting our metropolitan areas and southern Oregon has been devastated. We've had over forty thousand Oregonians who've had to evacuate, and we have a half a million Oregonians who are on some level of evacuation status. So these have been devastating. As I said the good news is that the weather is stabilizing, and it gives our hardworking firefighters an opportunity to go out and be proactive and build containment lines. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have clarity, yet, on how the fire started? GOVERNOR KATE BROWN: No. The-- that will be investigated over the days and weeks ahead, but I have to tell you, we saw the perfect firestorm. We saw incredible winds. We saw very cold, hot temperatures. And, of course, we have a landscape that has seen thirty years of drought. This is truly the bellwether for climate change on the West Coast. And this is a wake-up call for all of us that we have got to do everything in our power to tackle climate change. MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, I-- I understand that's your conviction. I know a former Oregon lawmaker who's written an op-ed in The Washington Post, though, saying you can't blame climate change. Instead, it's a failure of your state government to prepare and that warnings were ignored regarding mismanagement of Oregon's forests. What is your response to that? GOVERNOR KATE BROWN: Well, I stood up a fire council about two and a half years ago. Folks came together, Republicans, Democrats, to tackle the issues. The council had an extensive report and called for extensive investments in our communities, harvesting and thinning. Unfortunately, the Republicans walked away from the legislative session and we were unable to get that done. But I would say this: it's both. It's decades of mismanagement of our forests in this country, and it is the failure to tackle climate change. We need to do both. And we can. MARGARET BRENNAN: We now know because of these fires all along the West Coast that Oregon has the worst air quality in the world. How are you keeping residents and your firefighters safe from this health threat and COVID at the same time? GOVERNOR KATE BROWN: So, we stood up our COVID modules early on. We were, obviously, aware that this could be a challenging fire season and our Oregon Health Authority, our Department of Forestry and our state fire marshal office came together early to develop these COVID modules. We've had thousands of firefighters helping fight fire in Oregon the past several weeks. The good news is so far we've seen no incidences of COVID. They've had to basically recreate our entire firefighting systems and they've done a phenomenal job. And doing that while working extremely hard, taking heroic efforts to save the lives of Oregonians across the state. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've had thousands of people have to evacuate, some potentially left homeless. Your state is one of those automatically sending ballots to voters at their home address. So, how is this going to affect voting in the upcoming election? GOVERNOR KATE BROWN: I just have to say, I was at the state fairgrounds yesterday. I met Red Cross volunteers, one of them, Brandi, she had to evacuate her family before she could come to work for the Red Cross. I met a couple who had also been evacuated. They were paying it forward. They were helping their fellow Oregonians by serving food and volunteering at the state fairgrounds. So Oregonians have done a phenomenal job helping out, stepping up for each other like we always do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will they be able to vote? GOVERNOR KATE BROWN: In terms of voting-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep. Go ahead. GOVERNOR KATE BROWN: In terms of voting, we were the first state in the country to be vote by mail. We have systems in place. I am confident that our secretary of state is working hard as we speak to make sure that every eligible Oregonian gets a ballot. And we'll make sure they have the opportunity to participate in this election. In Oregon-- MARGARET BRENNAN: In-person if needed? GOVERNOR KATE BROWN: --we believe that your vote is your voice and every single voice matters. MARGARET BRENNAN: And in-person if needed, to be clear? GOVERNOR KATE BROWN: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. GOVERNOR KATE BROWN: We continue to allow folks to vote in person if needed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Wonderful. Governor, thank you very much for your time and good luck to you. We know that Americans on the West Coast are fighting two unprecedented events at the same time, the worst ever fire season and this global pandemic. CBS News National Correspondent Mark Strassmann reports. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News National Correspondent): Outside Pacific Northwest fire zones, it's the double whammy. Evacuees fleeing flames escape one evolving crisis only to drop into another. MAN #1: Now, leaving-- MARK STRASSMANN: The ongoing COVID threat. New arrivals, many without masks, get screened first. But people wonder who here has the virus. MAN #2: Our goal is to get everybody housed into non-congregate shelters, meaning hotels. MARK STRASSMANN: Every day wildfires burn more areas into a page from dystopian fiction. COVID compounds the fight to hold off the flames, and fires compound the fight to hold off the virus. WOMAN: I feel it a little bit, like, in my throat now even with my mask. But, yeah, it's like-- it's the worst. MARK STRASSMANN: Firefighters on frontlines spread out even more. Homeowners become hold-outs, COVID's one reason. Research shows air pollution generated by wildfires may make the virus especially deadly. Most of COVID America shows improving two-week trends. New cases and deaths nationally both down by about twenty percent. Noteworthy because of the wildfires. In both California and Oregon, positivity rates have been improving. But another warning this week: Expect our COVID crisis to continue, even deep into next year. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI (Thursday): We need to hunker down and get through this fall and winter because it's not going to be easy. MARK STRASSMANN: Getting harder by the week, financial challenges for millions of Americans. In one survey, one-third of small businesses will have to cut wages or payrolls by the end of the month if there is no federal aid. In another, a majority of black and Latino Americans report serious financial problems in New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, and Chicago. Americans hunger for distractions. MAN #1: Clemson playing with a lot of pace here. MARK STRASSMANN: And football is back. College teams competed yesterday, although many games were canceled. It's week one in the NFL. Thirteen games today. But only Jacksonville, where the Jaguars play the Colts will let in any fans. Every seat was sanitized. Stadium officials practiced distancing spectators. Seventeen thousand fans will be allowed in, twenty percent of the stadium's capacity. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Here in Atlanta the Falcons play the Seattle Seahawks. Inside Mercedes Benz Stadium, all the stands will be empty today and at least through the end of September. So much of American life these days is like an NFL team right before kickoff, have a game plan but know how to adjust quickly. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks, Mark Strassmann. One of the companies hard at work on developing a vaccine for COVID-19 is Pfizer, and CEO Albert Bourla joins us now from Westchester, New York. Good morning to you. ALBERT BOURLA, PH.D. (Chairman and CEO of Pfizer): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you still expect to know by next month if your vaccine is effective? ALBERT BOURLA: Yes, in our base case, we have quite the good chance-more than sixty percent that we will know if the product works or not by the end of October. But, of course, that doesn't mean that it works. It means that we will know if it works. MARGARET BRENNAN: And then the time clock starts on government approval, which is a key factor there. I want to ask you about an announcement from Pfizer yesterday, which was that you're going to expand your vaccine trial to increase diversity. You're going to go from thirty thousand people up to forty-four thousand. What do you mean by diversity and what does it do for you? ALBERT BOURLA: Yes, this study has recruited very quickly. So volunteers from all over the country raised their hands to participate. So we are all-- almost done with thirty thousand people. Now, we feel quite comfortable with the safety of the product. So we want to expand to more vulnerable populations. For example, we go to younger people. Right now, the study recruits from eighteen to eighty-five. Now we will go to sixteen years old. Also, we will go to people with special conditions, chronic conditions like H-- HIV patients, but also we will try to use it to increase the diversity of the population. MARGARET BRENNAN: And by diversity, I know in your current study, about a quarter of the participants are racial minorities. We know that when it comes to the infections from COVID-19, it is black and brown America that is disproportionately being hit. Is it hard to recruit racial minorities for your test? And-- and should there be more in this next phase? If you're going from a quarter, what's your goal for the percentage this time? ALBERT BOURLA: Yeah, I think we should strive to have as-- as more diverse population as possible, but right now we are not bad. Actually, we have a population that globally only sixty percent are Caucasians, forty percent approximately minorities. Also, forty-four percent are older people. And we try, of course, to-- to increase with particular emphasis on African-Americans and Latinos. MARGARET BRENNAN: Those specific racial minorities-- minorities are who you're targeting. Why is it hard to recruit them in the first place? ALBERT BOURLA: I think it's not more hard than the other people, but it is also the focus of our vaccine's efforts are in places where there is a lot of disease right now. And that reflects, I think, also the diversity of the population where our clinical sites are, not necessarily the nation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Pfizer and a handful of the other big pharma companies came out with this letter earlier in the week pledging not to cut corners on safety. A number of prominent scientists at the FDA, the agency that will have to say whether your vaccine is safe, also came out with a public letter pledging the same. Can you say to our viewers, though, very clearly here on the science and on the protocols that it just-- they are going to have to wait until 2021 to get that shot in the arm? ALBERT BOURLA: I don't know if they have to wait until 2021, because, as I said, our studies, we have a good chance that we will know if the product works by the end of October. And then, of course, it is regulator's job to issue a license or not. But what I know is we have to go out and-- MARGARET BRERNNAN: So you think you could get the FDA to approve it as safe and distribute it across to Americans before the end of the year? ALBERT BOURLA: I cannot say what the FDA will do. But I think it's a likely scenario, and we are preparing for it. For example, we started already manufacturing and we have already manufactured hundreds of thousands of doses, so just in case we have a good study readout, conclusive and FDA plus the advisory committee feels comfortable but we will be ready. MARGARET BRENNAN: There are six U.S. pharmaceutical companies that have taken money from U.S. taxpayers as part of this investment to-- to jump start a vaccine. Your company chose not to take that taxpayer money as part of your research, which means if you fail that comes at a loss to Pfizer and your own pocketbook. So why do you think that's worth the risk? And what does it actually buy you? How much faster do things work? ALBERT BOURLA: You're right, if it fails, it goes to our pocket. And at the end of the day, it's only money. That will not break the company, although it is going to be painful because we are investing one billion and a half at least in COVID right now. But the reason why I did it was because I wanted to liberate our scientists from any bureaucracy. When you get money from someone that always comes with strings. They want to see how we are going to progress, what type of moves you are going to do. They want reports. I didn't want to have any of that. I wanted them-- basically I gave them an open checkbook so that they can worry only about scientific challenges, not anything else. And also, I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics, by the way. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on-- out of politics, it's interesting because we're talking, of course, about people being concerned of political influence to try to expedite a vaccine. I know you're saying that you won't cut corners to do that. But, backing up, to the question of when this is available to American people, what do you think is the best way to distribute it to the American people? Should the government be doing that? ALBERT BOURLA: No, if you are speaking about who should get it or not, I do think that the healthcare authorities of every-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Not just who but how. ALBERT BOURLA: The how I think is going to be very difficult for the government to do it. Likely they will collaborate with us because shipping medicines, it is complex and particularly when you want special storage conditions. But we know how to do it very well. So I think it's going to be a collaboration between the government of each country and us. But to who will get the vaccine, I think it's something that the authorities should decide. In the U.S., for example, the CDC. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Bourla, good luck to your scientists. Thank you for your time today. And we'll be right back with more FACE THE NATION. So stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with former FDA commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who is in Washington this week. He's a fellow at AEI and he also sits on the board of Pfizer. Good morning to you. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have consistently said on this program that American people shouldn't expect to get that shot in the arm until 2021. Doctor Bourla just seemed pretty optimistic, and he said it's not impossible to get it before that time. What is a realistic timeline? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, he was speaking to when Pfizer's likely to have data, and they've done internal modeling about when they could have a result from the clinical trial. And this-- this clinical trial is an event-based trial, meaning that they have to wait until enough people in the clinical trial actually develop COVID disease to get a readout from the trial and whether or not the vaccine is actually preventing people from getting signs and symptoms of COVID. The initial market entry of this vaccine, if you will, is not going to be like a traditional approval of a vaccine where it's sort of a binary event and a vaccine gets licensed for a broad community. What it's likely to be is offered under an emergency use authorization to a very narrow population, initially, perhaps, front-line health care workers and first responders, maybe people above a certain age who were-- who are more likely to have a bad outcome from COVID. And then after the FDA gets more experience with the vaccine and after the original data set from these clinical trials continues to mature, then the FDA is going to slowly walk down that approval, meaning let it be available to successively larger groups of people while they collect very rigorous evidence in the post-market. So this is likely to be a very staged market entry. I think that's what people should expect. But for most people they will not have access to a vaccine until 2021. I think maybe the first quarter of 2021, probably the first half of 2021. And that's assuming that these vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and effective in these large trials. I think the people who will get it this year are going to be people, select populations, who are either at high risk of contracting the virus and perhaps spreading it or at high risk of having a bad outcome to it. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when the President said last week that we remain on track to deliver a vaccine before the end of the year, maybe even before November 1st, you think he's only referring to that emergency-use scenario and a very small part of the population, is that right? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think that that's right. I think we're going to be using this vaccine, at least initially, almost in a therapeutic sense. We're not going to use it like we use a traditional vaccine where you broadly vaccinate a population to try to prevent the virus from spreading across the population. What we're going to be doing is targeting the vaccine to select-- select groups of people who are at very high risk of a bad outcome from COVID to try to reduce their risk. But it's not going to be used to achieve broad-based immunity, at least in 2020, perhaps in 2021. And I think it's likely that if the FDA is able to get topline data from-- from the trial that Doctor Bourla was talking about at the end of October it's going to take them a number of weeks to even turn around an initial authorization. They're going to want to bring that before an advisory committee. They're going to want to scrub that data set very hard. So this isn't something you can just turn around in a couple of days. So, you know, I think hopefully we'll see some availability in 2020. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I'm optimistic that we will if these trials are successful, but it'll be very limited availability. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and you need people willing to take it. Kaiser had a study out saying sixty-two percent of Americans polled worry political pressure from the administration will cause the government to rush approval before it is actually safe. Why do you think the public is losing faith in these institutions? And does the problem go away after Election Day? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think perhaps some of it goes away after Election Day. There's a lot of anticipation around the election as an artificial deadline for vaccine news, and I think that that deadline is going to come and go. I don't think we're going to see an authorization before-- before the election. So, hopefully, everyone just takes a deep breath after the election. You know, look, I think that these things have been talked about in a political context, and that's atypical for the approval process for any product. It's not-- it's not extraordinary. We've seen it before, but it's atypical and especially with a vaccine-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --that people want to be confident and you want to try to keep the politics and the science separate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. We're going to take a quick break and come back with more from Doctor Scott Gottlieb in our next half hour. So please stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Tonight on 60 MINUTES, Bob Woodward talks to Scott Pelley in the first television interview about his new book, Rage. Here is a preview. (Begin VT) SCOTT PELLEY: Did the President ever disclose to you why he wasn't telling the public what the stakes were with the coronavirus? BOB WOODWARD: So in March, I asked exactly that question. You know, what's going on? And the President said-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (on the phone): Well, I think Bob really to be honest with you. BOB WOODWARD (on the phone): Sure, I want you to be. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (on the phone): I wanted to-- I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down-- BOB WOODWARD (on the phone): Yes. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (on the phone): --because I don't want to create a panic. BOB WOODWARD: I think he did not understand the American public. And he said, \"Well, I don't want to create a panic.\" We know from history, when the public is told the truth, they organize. We have a problem, we're going to step up. And Trump thought, oh, well, they'll panic when there is a crisis, when the President, particularly, knows something, it's time to tell the public in some form. He failed. SCOTT PELLEY: You write in the book that the President's handling of the virus reflects his instincts, habits, and style. What are those? BOB WOODWARD: Denial, making up his own facts. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's tonight on 60 MINUTES, 7:00 PM Eastern and Pacific on CBS. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more from Doctor Scott Gottlieb and United CEO. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We are continuing our conversation now with Doctor Scott Gottlieb. You just heard that sound bite from Bob Woodward. There has been a lot of scrutiny this week of the President's response to COVID-19 given the revelations in Bob Woodward's book. For any President their very first responsibility is to protect the American public. From your point of view, do you think the critical failing here was one of public messaging or was it operational? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, the public messaging wasn't clear and consistent in the outset and could have been better at all levels of government. I think if you look back in February, and I think when history looks back, the biggest failing over that month was that we were-- we were situationally blind. We had no idea where this virus was and wasn't spreading. And so when it came time to have to shut down cities, rather than focus on the cities that were truly epidemic, like New York City, we went for a simultaneous shutdown order across the whole country when that was unnecessary now, in retrospect, because there were a lot of cities where the virus wasn't spreading at that time and we could have focused on mitigation. But we had no diagnostic test in the field to screen people. And what-- what CDC officials were relying on and telling the coronavirus task force was that there was no spread of coronavirus in the United States in February, they were telling them that because they were looking at what we call the influenza-like illness surveillance network, basically a surveillance network of who's presenting to hospitals with flu-like symptoms. And they said that they're seeing no spike in people presenting with respiratory symptoms, therefore, coronavirus must not be spreading. And they were adamant about that. I was talking to White House officials over this time period. They were adamant about that. And I suspect the President was being told as well that this virus wasn't spreading in the United States. And that may have impacted what he did and didn't say and his willingness to, you know, as he said, talk it down a little bit because he was of the perception that this was not spreading here in the United States. That really was the tragic mistake, not just that we didn't have the information, but we were so confident in drawing conclusions off of what proved to be faulty information and incomplete information. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you saying he was failed by health officials? Are you letting him off the hook? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think in this respect, the White House leadership was failed by health officials. We did not have a diagnostic in the field, so we couldn't screen for it. We should have. We should have started working on that in January. And we over-relied on a surveillance system that was built for flu and not for coronavirus without recognizing that it wasn't going to be as sensitive at detecting coronavirus spread as it was for flu because the two viruses spread very differently. Those were two critical failings. Now, you could say, well, the President put those people in place, he's responsible. You know you can make second-order arguments around that. But I think ultimately the White House did not have the information they need to make decisions. The key function of agencies and the government is to provide policymakers with accurate, actionable information. The White House didn't have it. And I had a lot of conversations with the White House over this time period because I was concerned it was spreading here, and I was pushing them on that. And they were-- they were telling me over and over that they were hearing from top officials from the agencies that they were pretty confident that it wasn't spreading here. I think when history looks back, that's going to be a key moment. That's what was going on over February. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. All right. Doctor Gottlieb, always good to have your analysis. Thank you for joining us. We want to turn now to Sue Gordon, she is the former principal deputy director of National Intelligence, and resigned in August of last year. She joins us this morning from Sea Island, Georgia. Good morning to you. SUE GORDON (Former Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. You've got nearly forty years of experience in intelligence at the CIA and other agencies, and you had an op-ed this week in which you argued that election interference is a grave and persistent threat. You said you're frustrated with how all of us as a country are talking about election security. You said it's \"\u2026turned vitriolic, diversionary and unhelpful, and we are doing our enemies' work for them.\" What do you mean by that? SUE GORDON: So I think three things, Margaret. The first is I believe the most significant strategic threat to America is if we end up not believing in ourselves, and I've shared this with the President, there-- almost anything else we can overcome. But stopping to believe in the way that we govern in the way that we act would be devastating. The second is we know our adversaries are attacking our elections. There's-- there's little doubt on it. They continue to, they have in the past. And that's the bedrock of our democracy. But I think we're so focused on the elections themselves that we're forgetting that their intention is to achieve various interests. In the case of Russia it's to undermine democracy. In the case of China, it's to create an economic advantage and down the line. And when we don't understand the intention, when we don't understand the intention is to make us weak, and what we do is create a conversation that sows distrust in our leaders and our institutions, we've done their work for them. And what I wanted to do is provide some clarity around what we know, what we don't, what we're doing well and what we need to do better. MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you and I also hear you putting blame in-- in a lot of places for contributing to this. I do want to point out something the White House, the-- the President said from the White House podium this week, which was that he again said that his campaign was spied on. And then last night at a campaign rally, he said this about the 2020 election: PRESIDENT TRUMP (Last Night): And it's Democrats, they're going to-- they're trying to rig this election. If you go to New Jersey, if you go to Virginia, if you go to Pennsylvania, if you go to California to look at some of these races, every one-- every one of these races was a fraud, missing ballots. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this undermining of institutions you're talking about coming from the top? SUE GORDON: Yeah. So I'm-- I'm going to always hold the President more responsible than anybody else because he's, well, the President and his voice carries further, speaks louder. And so I think he always carries disproportionate responsibility. And that message that you can't trust our system, that you can't trust the vote, that you can't trust the other party that you can't trust is exactly what the Russians particularly hope to achieve. And their aim would be to sow to the divisions and to get Americans to say, you know what, it's not worth it. I can't trust it. We're not going to vote. But he's not the only one. When the other party says that a difference in policy means that he is malfeasant or evil or being controlled, that too is undermining it. So, his is the biggest voice. But there are others. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. This week, the U.S. Treasury actually put sanctions on a Russian agent who was part of a campaign-- SUE GORDON: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --to denigrate Joe Biden. This is the Trump administration-- SUE GORDON: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --acknowledging this is happening. When you were in office, was it the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia was trying to help President Trump win? SUE GORDON: So, again, go back to the interests of Russia. Russia is going to support anything that advances its interests. If they believe that President Trump's policies are ones that advantage them, then they will. And that's what you see. It doesn't mean that they prefer the human, it means that they're talking about the policies. And remember that Russia is a very capable adversary. They've been at this for a long time. They've been at this since the Cold War, and they will use human, they will use digital means in order to advance their interests. And I think that's the thing that I would stress. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SUE GORDON: When our adversaries attack us, they are doing it for their purpose. And when we don't respond properly, we are serving their aims. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe our election infrastructure, where you go to vote, how you go to vote, that it is adequately protected? SUE GORDON: Yeah, I am really proud of the work both the government has done to organize efforts not only at the federal level, but all the way down to state and local to protect the physical infrastructure around voting. And companies have leapt into the tray to-- tray to try and protect the infrastructure. So I would never say that it is impenetrable because we have this glorious, open nation that has lots of endpoints. But I think we are far better than we were in '18-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and we know there was Russian-- and we know there was Russian malware installed in election systems in Florida. SUE GORDON: Yeah, what we're talking about more is the systems around the elections, not the election infrastructure itself. So I think-- I think our infrastructure is as well protected as it's ever been, even though we can do better on that front. But, remember, half of it is influence, and when we look at the information that is being amplified and the misinformation that is going through our social media, we probably have more work to do on that front to ensure that inauthentic messaging that would sow divisions is more protected. So, we have more work to do there. But-- but as far as the infrastructure itself, even though, it can never be a hundred percent, we're in pretty good stead on that. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean by that? How do people at home protect themselves from being manipulated by what you're describing? SUE GORDON: Okay. So two ways I would say is for every individual, stop forwarding, sending messages that you don't know the origin. We know that on everything from COVID to mail fraud, our adversaries are amplifying putting messages and that look authentic. And if citizens just keep sending that out we're doing a pretty good job. So stop amplifying messages and forwarding message that you don't know their origin. And the second is start being some critic-- doing some critical thinking when you receive information and if it's someone telling you what to think or that you can't believe then do some research on your own. And cybersecurity across the board. Pay attention to cyber hygiene. It will save a lot of heartache. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said Twitter is of concern to you in particular and social media. Sue Gordon, it is great to get your insight. We're going to have to leave it there for time today-- SUE GORDON: Thanks, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: --but hope to have you back. And all of us here on FACE THE NATION will be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The airline industry is one of the hardest-hit this year due to the coronavirus. We want to go now to the CEO of United Airlines, Scott Kirby, who joins us from Beaver Creek, Colorado. Good morning to you. SCOTT KIRBY (CEO of United Airlines): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me this morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. The U.S. taxpayer, via the U.S. Congress, provided United and other airlines with emergency relief. United took about five billion in cash and loans as part of that emergency program. The deal expires October 1st. That's just two and a half weeks away. Do you still-- SCOTT KIRBY: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --expect to have to lay off roughly sixteen thousand people? SCOTT KIRBY: Yeah. So, first, I want to say what the administration, the Congress, both Houses, both parties-- it was a remarkable bipartisan response, really to rescue not just the aviation industry, but the whole economy back in March, an unprecedented bipartisan response. But this is lasting longer and is deeper than most people thought back then. And our revenue, we just said, is going to be down eighty-five percent in the third quarter. And in a world like that, United Airlines and others come October 1st without an extension of the CARES Act, we're hopeful that there will be before October 1st, is going to be forced to lay off employees just to survive. We have confidence in the long-term future and being able to bring everyone back. But getting through a crisis where revenue is down eighty-five percent is just not sustainable for an industry like aviation or almost any business for that matter. MARGARET BRENNAN: How many people will be laid off? SCOTT KIRBY: Well, at the moment, it's-- it's sixteen thousand, though we continue to work with our unions. Our unions have been fantastic partners. In a world where revenue is down that much, the layoffs are far smaller than they otherwise would have been. And we just got a deal last week that would save about three thousand of those jobs which are pilots. And we continue to work with unions on others. But the reality is without more government support for the whole economy there's going to be more layoffs to come across the economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand you're saying you hope more federal assistance is coming, but talks are stalled in-- in Congress. Why can't you go to the private markets for that money? What, specifically, do you need from the federal government? SCOTT KIRBY: So at United we have gone to the private markets. We raised about eighteen billion dollars since this started in capital and-- to get through the crisis. But in a world where we're still burning twenty-five million dollars per day, you just can't go forever on that. And our view is demand is not coming back. People are not going to get back and travel like they did before until there's a vaccine that's been widely distributed and-- and available to a large portion of the population. And I hope that happens sooner, but our guess is that's the end of next year. And so you just got to survive those losses through that time and be ready to bounce back. And we'll be prepared to bounce back and bounce back quickly. But really, you know, without government support for an industry that's as critical and an economic engine for the whole economy, that's really the point for aviation, is we drive economic activity not just for ourselves, but for the communities that we serve. MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. And-- and I want to underscore something you just said there, because you said you don't think business will be able to come back until there is a vaccine widely distributed. There is the perception, particularly among some conservatives, that the economy can come back while the virus continues to circulate. But you run an international airline, and right now Americans aren't even allowed into Europe. SCOTT KIRBY: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not allowed into Canada. They're not allowed into China. SCOTT KIRBY: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your international revenue was down ninety-six percent year over year in the last quarter. SCOTT KIRBY: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So is the bottom line here, you can't do both at the same time. SCOTT KIRBY: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: The virus needs to be under control. SCOTT KIRBY: Right. There are some parts of the economy that can recover and are doing well, but there are large parts of the economy, aviation is one of the most obvious, but anything to do with leisure, hospitality, meeting, convention services, restaurants are all hurting and-- and, frankly, are near depression levels. And borders, as you say, are closed around the world. And that's fifty percent of our revenue. And until borders open up that's not coming back. Business travel is almost nonexistent as people are doing things like this as they get through the pandemic. And even leisure travel is down significantly from where it was before. And that's just the reality. And in a business like ours, demand is not going to come back until people feel safe being around other people. And that's going to take a vaccine. And that's just the reality. Some businesses can recover earlier but in aviation and all the industries that we support, it's going to take longer. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you gotten any response from the Trump administration to this letter that you signed onto asking for some coordination with European officials for-- for testing, for example, that would allow for travel to open? SCOTT KIRBY: Look, what I would say is the administration and both parties, by the way, senators, congressmen and women on both sides of the aisle are very supportive of aviation, both the-- trying to find ways to open up borders through testing, but also through extension of the payroll support program. We just have to get a bigger deal done. We're kind of wrapped up in the bigger negotiations that are going on in Washington. But there's really a lot of support for aviation. And people understand the importance to the economy. You know, we just seem to be tied up in the-- in the Washington-- the larger Washington discussions about the future. But there's-- there's significant support. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, why do you think it's safe to fly? SCOTT KIRBY: Look, at United Airlines, we've been a leader in safety from the-- from the beginning of this. We're very proud of it. We created a partnership with Clorox and the Cleveland Clinic called CleanPlus that's helped us innovate and find ways to keep people safe, whether it's electrostatic spraying every airplane. We were the first-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT KIRBY: --really one of the first companies to require masks around the world. But I think the most important thing for safety on airplanes and the least understood is the airflow on airplanes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SCOTT KIRBY: The air-- aircrafts are designed to, you know, have the air come out of the ceiling to the floorboards and refiltered through HEPA-grade filters every two to three minutes. It's literally no place that you can ever be that's anywhere close to an airplane. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SCOTT KIRBY: And we've been doing some studies with the DARPA that'll-- that'll help demonstrate-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SCOTT KIRBY: --how safe aircraft really are. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Kirby, good luck to you. Thank you for your time. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump heads to Arizona to campaign tomorrow, and both candidates will be in Minnesota later this week. Both of those states are on the target list for the campaigns. Our CBS News Battleground Tracker shows Vice President Biden now with an edge in both. In Arizona, he is up three points, forty-seven to forty-four, and in Minnesota, a state that President Trump lost in 2016 by just one and a half points, now Mister Biden is up by a nine-point margin. CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto joins us with more from his poll. Good morning to you, Anthony. ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Good morning, Margaret. How are you? MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I'm well. So it was tight, we knew that in-- in Arizona. But now Biden has pulled ahead. What accounts for that? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, we saw this start to move over the summer, Margaret, amid concern over coronavirus and how the administration was handling it. That is still a huge factor. We find that people who are concerned about the virus, and there are still many, are less likely to vote for the President, and we find Joe Biden with a lead on people's perception of who would handle the outbreak better. But we wanted to understand more about why. And people tell us that looking back, they're more inclined to give the administration blame for how this was handled than to give them credit for perhaps mitigating the effects of the outbreak. And, you know, I should add, Margaret, the President, as you noted, is still very much in play here, is in the mix. And one of the reasons for that is continued strong support from his base, whose Republican base is still with him. And they also see this very differently when we ask them to look back. They're more inclined to see the President as having staved off what could have been a worse outbreak by doing what he did. And so I think that underscores the fact that it's how people evaluate things, not just what they evaluate, and the framework that they use in comparison that really matters and shifts votes here. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: A key point. And-- and what about on the issue of pocketbooks? What about the economy? ANTHONY SALVANTO: The President does relatively best on the economy of the issues that we measure here. And, in fact, a little bit of an edge over Joe Biden on it. It's interesting, and particularly for his supporters, the President's supporters, we find that even if they've been financially hit by the impact of the outbreak, they still give the President credit and still think that his policies are going to make things better. MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me what's happening in Minnesota. Because the Trump campaign has said they think they can flip it. But your data is not showing that. ANTHONY SALVANTO: The white working-class voters that were so important to helping the President make this close in 2016 are still largely with him. But some of that base has eroded. Now that base still believes the President is better on the economy, and better, specifically, when we ask about things like manufacturing, like agriculture, industries that may be important to them. But going the opposite way, Joe Biden is gaining in this state, as he is in many states, with, in particular, college-degree-holding voters, college-degree-holding women. There's a reason for that. They say, and even larger numbers that they're voting for Joe Biden to oppose the President. They feel in even larger numbers they don't like how the President handles himself personally. And I think if there's one key group that's been trending towards the Democrats you want to watch in all these states, it is those college-degree-holding women with whom Joe Biden is building much larger leads than the Democrats had back in 2016. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Minnesota was the state where this social justice movement has really erupted out of following the death of George Floyd. What were the perceptions that you found there in terms of what's actually going on with the protests? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. We wanted to understand just how people could see this so differently. We know that folks on the left and the right have very different views of the protests. But you look at folks on the left and they emphasize seeing the protesters as intending to raise awareness of racial discrimination, trying to change policing policies. But for folks on the right, they look at it and they see protesters as intending to destroy property and be violent and looting and also as perhaps even trying to overthrow the government. What I think this underscores is that different groups of folks can look at the same thing and come away focusing on different aspects of it. And that, again, underscores this why it is people may come to very different views. I think, Margaret, I would add that that's a thread running through this entire race--which is to say, voters are very locked in. We see more than nine in ten people who say that they have already made up their minds and they're not moving. MARGARET BRENNAN: Key point. Anthony Salvanto, thank you so much for your analysis. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "With more voters now expected to vote absentee than ever before, there has been a renewed focus on the voting process and on how ballots reach their final destination,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0CBSN political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns\u00a0report. Twenty six states allow a voter to designate someone else to return their ballot for them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A dozen of those states limit the number of ballots that the designee can collect and return on behalf of voters. And 10 states allow the ballot to be returned by the voter's family member. In states where the practice is legal, volunteers or campaign workers can go directly to the homes of voters, collect the completed ballots, and drop them off en masse at polling places or election offices. In some states, ballot harvesters can be paid hourly for their work collecting ballots. Critics fear that in states without restrictions on who can return a ballot on someone else's behalf, a third party could take advantage of the system by tampering with or discarding the ballots. Supporters of ballot harvesting say it's designed to expand access to voting, particularly for seniors and disabled citizens, as well as low-income and Native American communities, and that the program could help those concerned about Postal Service delays. Since many will be casting their votes in ways that are new to them, lawmakers and campaign operatives stress the importance of voter education. \"I would not give my ballot to a stranger no more than I would give my check to a stranger,\" said Nevada Democratic Assembly Speaker Jason Fierson, a proponent of ballot collection. \"We have to expect folks to take it seriously and be responsible.\" Read more about ballot harvesting\u00a0here. Joe Biden's campaign, along with joint fundraising committees, are expected to report surpassing $300 million raised in August, setting a new monthly record for presidential fundraising, according to two sources familiar with the former vice president's fundraising efforts. Biden's campaign did not return request for comment on their fundraising. The massive cash haul flooded in last month as Biden announced his vice presidential pick, Senator Kamala Harris, and officially accepted the party nomination in the first ever virtual Democratic National Convention,\u00a0report\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice and campaign reporter Bo Erickson. The New York Times was the first to report the $300 million fundraising figure on Tuesday. Biden's August fundraising more than doubles what the Biden campaign and entities raised in July when the campaign, Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees brought in $140 million. In comparison to previous campaign cycles, in August 2016, Hillary Clinton's campaign and joint fundraising committees announced raising $143 million. In 2012, President Obama's reelection campaign and the Democratic National Committee announced raising $114 million that August and $181 million that September. In September 2008, Obama and the DNC together raised $193 million, which was the previous record. Last month, Biden's campaign revealed it raised $48 million in 48 hours after announcing Harris as Biden's running mate. The Democratic National Convention also brought in $70 million over four days. At the same time, the Trump campaign, Republican National Committee and joint fundraising entities announced raising $76 million last month during their four-night convention. The Trump campaign has not yet announced its total fundraising for the month of August. The presidential campaigns and political parties face a September 20 monthly filing deadline with the Federal Election Commission. Biden and Kamala Harris talked about what's wrong with President Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout, about voting rights, and about their long-term plans for the country beyond the virus in a 15-minute video released by the campaign and first obtained by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. On the president's handling of the coronavirus, the Democratic presidential nominee said, \"COVID, he [President Trump] didn't cause. But, my God, the way it's been responded to. And I don't think he gets it.\" He added, \"I just don't get how there's not a more significant understanding of the incredible pain that is occurring in America and the economic chaos caused from that.\" Harris echoed her running mate and accused Mr. Trump of \"dismissing\" the pandemic, treating it as something \"he can just flick away.\" For more on their conversation click\u00a0here. The former VP held no other public events Tuesday, but at a nearby school, Jill Biden launched her \"Back to School\" tour in Wilmington, Delaware. This tour will be in-person and virtual in 10 cities in eight battleground states,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0was told. A teacher for 36 years, Biden visited with school staff and administrators at Shortlidge Academy to talk about their virtual learning system, which is set for at least the next six weeks. In prepared remarks outside in front of a closed-down playground wrapped with \"CAUTION\" tape, Biden said she recognized that the usual excitement of back-to-school time has turned to \"anxiety\" this year. She called for better rural broadband for virtual learning and additional mental health services for school kids. She also repeated her husband's promise to appoint an education secretary with teaching experience. Biden did not answer any questions from reporters about the Trump administration's stance on school reopening. \"I don't think we're going to take questions now,\" she replied as she left a classroom. \"We are officially into September,\" the Trump campaign manager declared on a call with reporters, Tuesday. \"This is when voters start to tune in. And from our perspective, this is when a campaign wants to be on offense.\" The president's re-election bid has recast its September strategy as an \"offensive\" dead-set on overtaking 2016 battleground state near-misses like Minnesota, New Hampshire and Nevada. But while the campaign is competing for traditionally Democratic voters in the North Star state, it has also played defense in seemingly safe states with $18 million and $6 million reserved in television ad buys in Ohio and Iowa respectively. \"As long as we hold onto Florida and do well in states that we believe we are safe in like Arizona and North Carolina, Joe Biden has to shut us out and go four for four in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said, laying out the campaign's path to the 270 electoral votes needed to secure victory in November,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports. Fresh off a GOP convention featuring a handful of Latino elected officials, Miller also predicted President Trump would earn \"north of 40% of Hispanic voters\" in 2020, which would be a 12-point spike from 2016. The last Republican candidate to attract that kind of coalition was President George W. Bush in 2004, who had 44% of Latino support. Both Miller and Stepien flagged President Trump and Vice President Pence's travel as big indicators of the Trump campaign's November goal posts. The president traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin Tuesday, despite concern and criticism by some local leaders who worry his presence in the area could exacerbate the situation and fuel tensions following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. At a law enforcement roundtable in Kenosha, Mr. Trump made no mention of Blake or specific police reform, declaring only that \"bad apples\" in the law enforcement have to be held accountable. \"They choke sometimes,\" President Trump added. Meanwhile, Pence made a campaign stop in Exeter, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, part of Luzerne County. \"We're not too far from our opponent's boyhood home, but it's Trump country now,\" the vice president said.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0reports Luzerne is one of three longtime Democratic counties in the state that flipped for President Trump in 2016. It also borders Lackawanna County, where Biden grew up. Speaking at Kuharchik Construction in Luzerne County, Pence rebutted Biden's speech in Pittsburgh the day before. He attacked Biden for being critical of law enforcement and not explicitly condemning Antifa yesterday, saying, \"I think you all know: you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America.\" Pence also doubled down on Mr. Trump's false claims that Biden wants to ban fracking, a drilling technique that's boosted Pennsylvania's economy. Although Biden again reaffirmed yesterday in Pittsburgh that he does not plan to ban fracking on private land, Pence cited Biden telling a potential voter in New Hampshire last fall that he'd end fossil fuels. \"Joe, that includes fracking...I guarantee with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House we'll have more fracking,\" Pence said. On Monday, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak moved to delay the end of the state's eviction moratorium by 45 days. Such moratoriums have already lapsed in the majority of the 43 states that enacted them amid the outbreak,\u00a0according to data\u00a0compiled by Princeton University's Eviction Lab. President Trump recently floated executive action to stop states from throwing people out of their homes,\u00a0telling reporters\u00a0\"a lot of people are going to be evicted.\" Elizabeth Renteria, who used to be a guest room attendant on the Strip, said, \"I'm behind in my rent, my electricity, everything.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says\u00a0Renteria is a member of the Culinary Union, which claims to represent 60,000 across the state's hospitality and gaming industry. The labor group is\u00a0among the union locals\u00a0demanding a \"right to return\" measure by local lawmakers to guarantee laid-off workers can return to their previous positions following the pandemic in Nevada.\u00a0A recent Census survey\u00a0found 66% of Nevadans reported a loss of income in their household, greater than any other state in the country. \"I've been looking for other resources,\" Renteria said. \"I already spoke with my landlord and she said she could work with me on that. But really, I'm so behind. I really need to go back to work.\" The Biden campaign appeals to Gen Z voters in a recent campaign ad featuring Tallahassee native Adrianna Williams, 21, who discusses the protests that have rocked the nation in recent months, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell. In 30-second and 60-second\u00a0ads, Williams, a student at Duke University and a national co-chair of Black Students for Biden, talks about the importance of activism and democracy while unpacking why \"Black lives should more than just matter.\" In the ad, Williams says, \"These protests are not just about police brutality anymore. They're about addressing systemic racism and economic disparities across our country.\" She adds, \"I think electing Joe Biden is essential to addressing these issues and getting meaningful change. We have to continue the activism, we have to continue protesting, but we also have to go out and vote.\" According to Kantar/CMAG data, the 30-second version of the ad is now airing in Spokane, Washington. Williams is the daughter of former Florida House Representative Alan Williams and Leon County School Board attorney Opal McKinney Williams. In a\u00a0new episode\u00a0of \"The Debrief with Major Garrett,\"\u00a0CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett\u00a0explores how the civil rights movement of the of the 1960s led to the renewed push for equality today. Fifty-seven years after Martin Luther King, Jr. led the March on Washington for civil and voting rights legislation, protesters returned to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial this past Friday to demand justice for African Americans killed by police, and several of them spoke to the team behind \"The Debrief with Major Garrett.\" Ondine Woods Foster from Mobile, Alabama, attended last week's March on Washington and told CBS News she grew up during the civil rights movement. She said, \"We had to push our way through to be successful\" and \"we have to instill those same things into our children to let them know that there's nothing impossible that they can reach for the skies, that they can reach for the stars.\" Between a global pandemic, outcry over the police-involved deaths of George Floyd and Jacob Blake and the political fallout, the summer of 2020 won't soon be forgotten. Listen to the episode for interviews with Martin Luther King III, historian John Whittington Franklin, Black Lives Matter Greater New York Chairperson Hawk Newsome and more. It's another month in the books for fundraising ahead of the 2020 election, and while focus might be at the top of the ticket, down ballot efforts are breaking new records, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. According to the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the DLCC had the best online fundraising day in committee history on August 31, in an election year where state legislatures will play a major role in redistricting following the 2020 census. The cash haul comes after the committee also announced surpassing its $36 million fundraising record set during the 2018 cycle with more than two months still to go before the 2020 election. \"State legislative elections this November are enormously consequential, which is why we're not taking anything for granted,\" said DLCC President Jessica Post in a statement. \"Our unprecedented fundraising demonstrates that Democrats are more focused on down ballot races than ever before, and we're just getting started. We're going to keep breaking records and we're going to flip legislative chambers and seats across the country from red to blue in just a couple months.\" The DLCC credits its record cash haul this cycle thanks largely in part due to its grassroots digital fundraising efforts, which has raised a record online with nearly 400% growth compared to 2016. In January, the DLCC announced a $50 million \"Flip Everything\" effort targeting more than a dozen state legislative chambers across the country. In a decision that the Georgia Secretary of State's office is planning to immediately appeal, U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross of the Northern District of Georgia ruled Monday that absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day and that arrive at county election offices by 7 p.m. on November 6 -- three days later -- can be counted in the November election.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0notes that this decision comes just two months before the general election. Georgia's Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs called the extension a \"bad idea\" in a statement. \"Extending the absentee ballot receipt deadline is a bad idea that will make it nearly impossible for election officials to complete their required post-election tasks in the timeline that is required by law,\" said Fuchs. However, Nse Ufot, CEO of the voter advocacy group The New Georgia Project, said in a statement that Judge Ross' ruling confirms that our democracy responds to changing societal needs. \"Tens of thousands of Georgia voters will now have the opportunity to have their ballots counted as long as they are postmarked by Election Day and delivered up to three days afterward,\" said Ufot in a statement. \"This is a great day for democracy but the fight to ensure that ALL Georgians have access to the ballot box continues.\" Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced that the first round of absentee ballot request forms will be arriving in the mailboxes of registered Ohio voters this week, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. In order for Ohioans to vote absentee, they need to fill out the request forms and then mail the form to their county board of elections. Absentee ballots will then be sent to voters beginning on October 6. \"With the convenience of voting from home comes a responsibility - don't wait to make your voice heard,\" LaRose said in a statement. \"Get your ballot request form in the mail as soon as you can.\" According to a press release, LaRose's office said there will be two more rounds of forms that will be mailed to Ohioans who register to vote through the registration deadline, which is October 5. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court is taking over another election issue case, it announced today, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. This suit, filed by the state Democratic Party in July, asked the Commonwealth Court to explicitly allow counties to use drop boxes and satellite election offices to collect ballots and to count ballots they receive up to a week after Election Day, so long as they're postmarked by it. The secretary of state, who has been supportive of drop boxes and some late counting, asked the Supreme Court to exercise extraordinary jurisdiction in the case. The court decided to take the case Tuesday, with its two Republican justices dissenting. The original suit was filed as a counter to the Trump campaign's federal court lawsuit in the western district, which asked largely for the reverse and is now stayed so state courts can interpret the law. It's the second election lawsuit at the state's highest court. The centennial anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment just passed in August. The crowning achievement of the women's suffrage movement, the amendment reads, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\" In reality, though,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0reports\u00a0not all women were granted the right to vote in 1920. That milestone wouldn't come until the 1965 Voting Rights Act. And even now, Congresswoman Deb Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico, considers the anniversary to be representative of obstacles that remain. \"We are still in a battle for access to voting, especially for communities of color, and working people,\" she said in an interview. In the same way that many Americans, especially White Americans, have come to recognize that holidays like the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving are more complicated than fireworks and turkeys, the 19th Amendment centennial also merits another look --at both its triumphs and its shortfalls. Senator Ed Markey and Congressman Joe Kennedy III are crossing Massachusetts Tuesday to deliver the last pitch to voters in the Democratic Senate primary ahead of polls closing at 8pm, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. A Kennedy has never lost in Massachusetts, but recent polling has Markey slightly ahead of Robert F. Kennedy's grandson. \"This race is not over.,\" Markey told reporters Tuesday morning. \"We don't know how this is going to turn out today, and that's why we're working hard to get every vote out.\" Just a year ago, Markey was facing two other challengers in the primary race and was behind in polling by double digits to Congressman Kennedy who hadn't even entered the race. Since then, Markey has made the race more competitive than many thought it would be, in part because of his partnership with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in authoring the Green New Deal. Seventeen-year-old Abigail Mack of Bridgewater, Massachusetts told CBS News she will be voting for Ed Markey in the general election because of his progressive proposals. \"I think Joe Kennedy - the fact that Ed Markey was the person he was challenging is what turned me away from him because trying to challenge an incumbent that is a progressive kind of defeats the purpose of trying to put someone new in,\" Mack said, adding, \"Like when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ran against Joe Crowley, I think that was a race that needed to happen to get someone more progressive in a seat that was held by someone who was just a sitting duck.\" Daniela Finlay, who goes to Wellesley College in Massachusetts, told CBS News, \"I'm supporting Ed Markey because he's been fighting for our futures since before I was even alive, and I'm not supporting Joe Kennedy because I don't think now is the time to be primarying the author of the Green New Deal. \" Kennedy's campaign is hoping a coalition of voters will show up to vote in-person on Election Day to take him over the finish line. Nick Clemons, Kennedy's campaign manager, told CBS News this past weekend, \"We know our voters are more likely to vote on Election Day. They're not early voters, they're not vote by mail folks, so we're pushing our coalition out the door, phone banking, texting, everything we can do to get them out to vote.\" There are still plenty of Massachusetts voters who value the congressman and the whole Kennedy family. Rigoperto Quinonez, who is volunteering with his wife to get out the vote for Kennedy in Boston, told CBS News, \"Every time a new Kennedy comes to office, something happens. For some reason, something happens. Something changes, and there's a dynamic in Washington when they come to office that they have no choice but to listen to them when they speak.\" Markey invoked the Kennedy name in his speech Monday night to supporters when he said, \"I think it's right at this time to ask what your country can do for you,\" playing off of the famous John F. Kennedy inaugural address in which he said, \"Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.\" Markey and his campaign have played off of the Kennedy name and have alleged that Kennedy's father, Joe P. Kennedy, is giving money to a political action committee supporting Congressman Kennedy's bid. Despite the tension, Congressman Kennedy told reporters Monday night that he would support Markey as the nominee if he were to win. \"Look, it's been a spirited campaign,\" Kennedy said. \"I still respect Senator Markey, but yes, I look forward to supporting a Democratic nominee, I think that's going to be me, and I would hope he'd say the same thing.\" ADVERTISEMENTS The Democrat and Republican House Committees launched a flurry of ads across the battlefield Tuesday, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In total, 17 attack ads came out. Seven of them were from the National Republican Congressional Committee, hitting five incumbents and two Democrat challengers on a variety of issues. Its ad in\u00a0New York's 24th District\u00a0splices sound from Joe Biden criticizing Medicare for All with sound from House candidate Dana Balter supporting it. Two ads dealt with the topic of police and protests, with one criticizing Congressman Anthony Brindisi's support for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. \"Brindisi even backed Pelosi's anti-police bill to help accused criminals, and prevent police from protecting us, because Anthony Brindisi backs criminals over cops and Pelosi over us,\" the\u00a0ad concludes. Meanwhile, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released 10 ads in eight districts, with at least five of them running in incumbent districts. Healthcare and prescription drug prices were a common message in each of the ads. \"While we're waiting for Ann Wagner to answer our calls, she's busy calling the corporate drug and insurance industries, who've given her more than $1.3 million in campaign cash,\"\u00a0one ad running\u00a0in Missouri's 2nd says about GOP Congresswoman Ann Wagner. The Democrat-backed House Majority PAC also launched two ads Tuesday, in Oklahoma's 5th District and New York's 22nd District. ENDORSEMENTS The U.S. Chamber of Commerce pulled a surprise move Tuesday, moving forward with endorsing a slate of 23 freshmen House Democrats. A source familiar with the matter confirmed to\u00a0Navarro\u00a0a list of endorsed Democrats, including Representatives Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico and Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, three freshmen House members sitting in districts Trump won by double digits. \"I am honored to have the endorsement of the U.S. Chamber because it means I've delivered on my promise to bring both parties together in support of Oklahoma's businesses and economic opportunity in our state,\" Horn said in a statement. The Chamber will also be endorsing 29 freshmen Republicans. The Chamber of Commerce is a lobbying group that has historically supported Republican candidates. The group endorsed and supported a Democrat challenger to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in June, but roughly 73% of their contributions to candidates this cycle\u00a0have been to Republicans. This gap is flipped when it comes to just House recipients though, as the Center for Responsive Politics finds that $104,833 has gone to Democrats while $74,650 has gone to Republicans. The endorsements come after reports of internal disagreement over whether these Democrats are pro-business enough to warrant the chamber's support.\u00a0The Hill reported\u00a0the committee voted for the endorsements, with five to one in support of it. A spokesman for the Chamber said they could not comment on internal processes. MASSACHUSETTS While the Democratic primary in Massachusetts' 1st District is the most high-profile race tonight, two other primaries are worth keeping an eye on, according to\u00a0Navarro. In the state's 4th District, a crowded field of seven is competing to fill Congressman Kennedy's old seat. The\u00a0latest poll\u00a0shows city councilor Jake Auchincloss and town board member Jesse Mermell in a dead heat as the primary's front runners. Like Congressman Richard Neal, Congressman Stephen Lynch is facing a progressive challenge from Robbie Goldstein in the state's 8th District. Lynch has held the seat since 2001. Former Massachusetts Representative Michael Capuano said in a call with former members of Congress if Neal or Lynch gets defeated Tuesday, \"it's not definitive, but it certainly will raise my hackles a little bit.\" Capuano, who called himself more of a \"traditional progressive\" on Tuesday, was beaten in his 2018 Democratic primary against Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. \"Do I worry about a few on the extreme left wing? No, not all,\" he said. \"If you're making me make a choice between free healthcare and QAnon, that's really not a choice to make. But I hope the moderate middle is the long-term successor.\"",

Neumann discusses potential repercussions, offers some advice to the incoming Biden administration and considers the possibility of a civil war in Afghanistan. Highlights \"Intelligence Matters\": Ronald Neumann Producer: Paulina Smolinski MICHAEL MORELL: Ambassador, this episode is part of a series of episodes that we're doing between the election and the inauguration on the key national security issues facing the country. We started a few weeks ago with H.R. McMaster, who gave us an overview of all the issues. Now we're taking a deep dive on each of them. Today, we are very lucky to have you with us to talk about Afghanistan: its past, its future, and what the U.S. policy should be.\u00a0 But before we do that, what I'd love to do is give my listeners a sense of who you are. How did you end up in the Foreign Service? I'm sure your father had a little role in that. AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: My father, when I was growing up, was a university professor. Later on, he became a very odd animal. He was a political appointee ambassador who served four presidents, three posts, and two parties. When I was growing up, we had various strange foreigners and others coming through the house when he was a university professor. Somehow that got me interested. I decided very young that I wanted to go in the foreign service. I hadn't had a particular focus. Then my father became ambassador to Afghanistan, which makes us one of only three fathers and sons to have run the same embassy in our diplomatic history. MICHAEL MORELL: I know that John Adams and John Quincy Adams were one. What was the other one? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: I've discovered there was a family named Francis. I know absolutely nothing about them except that the father and son were both minister to the court of Austria, Hungary.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: That's very cool.\u00a0 AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: It has no political significance. You can do it about once every hundred years. In any event, I first went to Afghanistan in 1967. When my father was ambassador, I had a three-and-a-half-month break between graduate school and needing to report for the U.S. Army where I'd gotten carried away and volunteered. My wife and I went to Afghanistan, which was peaceful in those days. We traveled all over the country and saw parts of Afghanistan that foreigners are not likely to see for a long time. We were out everywhere by Jeep, by horse, even into the Palmyras.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: What was it like in those days? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: Primitive but peaceful. I went with a hunting party where we went all the way up to the northeast, where there's this funny little panhandle that goes out along what was then the Soviet border. We had a group of foreigners and we had hunting rifles, but they were packed away. Nobody bothered us. We traveled to the absolute end of the road by Jeep and then by horse, and up into the Palmyras to the high plateaus into that panhandled base camp at about thirteen thousand feet.\u00a0 I traveled all over the country at that point, sometimes with my wife and sometimes alone. It was peaceful. MICHAEL MORELL: How long were you in the army before the Foreign Service? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: Almost three years. I passed the Foreign Service test before I got carried away. I got a letter when I was in Vietnam asking if I could join. I put in my paperwork. They lost it. I put in my paperwork a second time. I had finished my Vietnam tour. It was on my 30 day leave when I got the notice that my release was approved and two weeks later, I was in Washington joining the Foreign Service. MICHAEL MORELL: Give us give us a sense of your career path in the Foreign Service.\u00a0 AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: It has been essentially a path that you can see on a fairly small map of the Middle East and South Asia. I had one excursion tour in West Africa, in Senegal. But after that, I served in my overseas tours in Iran, Yemen, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Then Algeria as ambassador, Bahrain as ambassador, and Iraq after the invasion for about a year and a half, and then Afghanistan. MICHAEL MORELL: How long were you in Afghanistan? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: A little less than two years. When I wrote a memoir, I called it Three Embassies, Four Wars. I think that's really all you need to know from my short biography. MICHAEL MORELL: I'm interested in your sense of how the Foreign Service has changed from when you started your career and when you ended it? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: Wow, I suppose in my part of the world, one difference is it's not quite as much fun. More people seem to be shooting at each other. One big difference that bothers me is that we're not getting out as much. There are a lot of reasons and pressures that keep people at their computer. But overall, it is the the fears of security and also the fears of having your career blown up if you survive a security incident. There's a big problem here. One of the problems is this so-called accountability review board, which is twenty five year old legislation. My day job at the American Academy of Diplomacy, we are working on a project to get Congress to change that law. MICHAEL MORELL: It's really important to get out because that's how you end up knowing the country and knowing the people.\u00a0 AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: The ultimate job of the foreign service is to persuade foreigners to do things that we want them to do. You only do that well if you understand where they're coming from and what their pressures are. You don't have to sympathize or agree with them. You have to understand them, so that you know how to present your own arguments, your own case. So you can tell Washington occasionally that an idea sounds bright, but it's not going to work. MICHAEL MORELL: What you're describing in terms of the difference you saw; I saw a similar difference when I was sitting at CIA. As a very young analyst in 1980, I was reading these incredibly rich, deep pictures of the countries that I was following that were written by State Department officers on the ground. By the time I left the agency in 2013, those kind of cables from the State Department were few and far between. AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: That's sad because that's the world that I grew up in, and that I still believe in. Frankly, an ambassador who wants that kind of reporting can get it from his team, but he has to give them the backup, the support, and the top cover to get out and to see multiple contacts.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: You're still involved today. You're running this organization called the American Academy of Diplomacy. What is its mission? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: It's a very small organization of former senior diplomats, mostly foreign service, but not all. We have some noncareer appointees, some people with backgrounds in intelligence, USAID. It's basically people who have worked at senior levels trying to get foreigners to do what we want as a matter of policy. Its mission is twofold. One is explaining what diplomacy is to Americans. We have two podcasts, one called American Diplomat, it's a lot of life stories, the other called The General and the Ambassador that focuses on how ambassadors and senior commanders have worked together. There's an awful lot in that area that people don't know. Our other area is pushing things at the Department and Congress that we think would improve the quality of our diplomacy. MICHAEL MORELL: Let's jump to Afghanistan today. On February 29th, earlier this year, there was an agreement signed between the United States and the Taliban. What was in that agreement? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: Great starting place, because it's a very unbalanced agreement in a sense. First of all, it's really important that people understand it is not a peace agreement. It is a withdrawal agreement for the U.S. We committed to a very specific withdrawal calendar, part of which was to be very quick and then the rest of which was to come about by May of next year. The logic of the case was that if we put a firm withdrawal timetable in the agreement, the Taliban would agree to direct negotiations with the Afghan state and that was the only way we were going to get to such negotiations, which are the essential way of ending the war. That has not fully worked.\u00a0 There are a couple of things the Taliban have adhered to. They have, by and large, not attacked the foreigners, us and our NATO allies. They have mostly adhered to not attacking cities. They have not attacked so much in Kabul, but they are not really adhering to that. They've had major attacks on some other cities. There was an expectation, which is not in the agreement itself. It's not in the any public text that there would be a lowering of violence. The Taliban has gone in the other direction. They have picked up the pace. America gave up a point that was a central point all the way from the attack against us in 9/11 until this agreement, where we had insisted that the Taliban had to break ties with al-Qaida. We gave that up. We modified it so it's an agreement that there won't be any extremist violence against us or our allies from Afghanistan. It's a very vague, wishy washy kind of commitment. I guess it means that al-Qaida can have their R&R facilities in Afghanistan, but not their planning headquarters. In any event, the Taliban have not given up ties with al-Qaida.\u00a0 That's been documented by the U.N. So you have had the start of negotiations as agreed in the document, although the Taliban do not recognize the Afghan government. So the negotiations are with a mixed group of political leaders. However, the negotiations have started only in form. The Taliban have put forward new conditions to start and the argument since then has been about their starting conditions. As of yet, you do not have any actual peace negotiations going on, although we are ahead of schedule on our troop withdrawal. MICHAEL MORELL: The negotiations say we will leave in a certain period of time if certain conditions are met. But it doesn't spell out those conditions, correct? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: The agreement itself doesn't even say anything about the conditions. Now, at the beginning when it was signed, former Secretary of Defense Esper and Secretary Pompeo were very outspoken about how this was conditions based. I don't know that anybody believes that any more. We didn't have much credibility on the idea of conditions based all the way back at the Obama administration when we talked about it. We didn't do it with our withdrawal from our big surge. Now the Taliban have continued to ratchet up violence. People like Ambassador Khalilzad have testified in public that they are not meeting all the conditions, and we have accelerated the withdrawal program. So whether conditions means anything to anybody is not clear. MICHAEL MORELL: What's your take on this agreement? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: Their logic of starting on this basis is not necessarily bad. But when you look at this agreement and when you look at similar wars elsewhere, you get to a peace only when both sides believe they cannot win on the battlefield and they have to settle down and actually make an agreement. I don't think that condition yet applies. The Taliban believes they're winning. The first thing to understand about this kind of negotiation is that it is not an alternative to violence. It's a parallel track. The fighting is where you create the leverage to push the other side. So I expect the fighting will go up and down. Right now with a change of our administration, I expect the fighting to get much worse because I believe the Taliban will likely do everything they can to box in the Biden administration, to give them as little room for maneuver and choice as possible. I think the Biden administration is going to have to think about that a little faster than they're probably going to want to. MICHAEL MORELL: If the Taliban's mindset is that they're winning. What's the mindset of the Afghan government, our allies, in this whole thing? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: The Afghan government has said that it wants a peace which preserves human rights, particularly women's rights, and which preserves as much of the constitutional structure of Afghanistan as possible, including elections. The Taliban is not interested in any of that at present. They want the Islamic Emirate back. The positions right now are frankly incompatible. But lots of peace agreements have started with incompatible positions. MICHAEL MORELL: We talk all the time about the U.S. troop presence there, but not many people talk about the financial support that the U.S. government provides to the Afghan government. How important is that money to the Afghans? And was that part of the discussion at all between between the United States and the Taliban? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: It was not to my knowledge, remember, I was not in those talks. I'm not in the government anymore. But there were certainly, to the best of my knowledge, no specific figures. On the other hand, the Taliban have been clear that they would like America to remain involved. They understand that if they do come to power, they're going to have a busted country and we're the only ones with the resources to really help them. So there have been marginal discussions and understanding. As far as the current situation goes, our payment and the payment of other allies- remember we've got all the NATO countries and some others as well helping to pay for the Afghan army- that level of payment is key to maintaining the size of the army that is necessary to fight this insurgency in a very poor country. MICHAEL MORELL: Looking forward where do you think we will be on January 20th? What will Joe Biden inherit in Afghanistan? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: He will inherit an ongoing war that is not going very well. Right now, militarily, the basic situation is that the Afghan forces, with our support, are standing on the defensive, pushing back when they're hit hard.\u00a0 The Taliban are cautiously on the offensive, pulling back a little when they meet too much resistance. That means the strategic initiative on the battlefield right now is with the Taliban. We have undermined Afghan confidence by this extra pullout of troops that President Trump just did. So we're in a shaky position. At the same time, the Taliban has not broken with al-Qaida. Our most fundamental national interest in Afghanistan is not to have it again become the victory of al-Qaida and terrorist forces. That is easier to prevent than it is to have a victory strategy. I think when Biden comes in, he's going to find that violence is up. He will have an enormous number of other issues that he needs to work on. Afghanistan is not going to be the first thing. But the Taliban will be trying to run the situation before h\\e can catch up with it. If this was a pool game, they're trying to run the table before he gets to break. The first decision that President Biden will have to make is whether he can make clear that he's not going to be run out of the game before he has time to think about it. I don't think anybody can reasonably expect that he's going to come in with his mind totally made up to every piece of the strategy. But I think he has a tremendous need to say something about no further troop withdrawals and no lessening of support until he has time for his own review. He needs to stabilize both the military situation and stabilize the political situation in Kabul by making it clear that he's not going to be run off until at least he has time to think about it and consult with his allies, which we've been pretty lackadaisical about. He needs to then make clear to everybody what his policy is.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: In putting together a strategy, the first thing you need to do is be able to articulate what your national interests are in a particular place or issue. You mentioned one of them, which is counterterrorism. But are there other strategic interests when you look at Afghanistan?\u00a0 AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: No, I think there are other interests. Then you have to get into complex discussions. How much are these worth? How much money? How much blood? First of all, you have regional stability. If Afghanistan collapses, I don't think you have a Taliban quick victory. You have a descent into civil war again, in which you will find all the outside powers drawn in and all of the local terrorist resistance organizations, whether it's Uzbekistan or Chinese or Tajik with bases in Afghanistan. You have a potential for rippling insecurity coming out of Afghanistan. At some point that's going to begin to touch things you don't want to be messing with. Although you could make an argument that maybe we don't care about anything. So you have instability.\u00a0 You have a long-term commitment the United States has made to the people of Afghanistan, to Afghan women, to the constitutional process. There's a real question, 'what is that worth?' It's not worth everything. But if you are going to get involved in the future anywhere and make similar commitments, then the question of whether your commitments are meaningful is also a national interest. It isn't the be all and end all. It isn't that you have to always put good money after bad if things don't work, but it is of interest. MICHAEL MORELL: You mentioned the regional instability. For years, the flow of extremism went from Pakistan into Afghanistan. In the situation that you were describing, I was thinking about the flow of extremists going the other direction now and what that could potentially mean for Pakistani stability which we should care about because it is a nuclear armed state. How do you think about that? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: I think it's a serious problem. I'm not sure whether the Pakistanis agree. You do have the Pakistani Taliban which is at war with the Pakistani state, and they are now based in Afghanistan. You have the Islamic State, which is also not a friend to Pakistan, based there. So a real collapse does have the potential to make things in Pakistan worse. It's not clear whether the Pakistanis fully agree with it. They don't seem to be supporting a Taliban victory. They seem to be content with a difficult situation. I don't know whether the Pakistanis believe they have the power to actually make an agreement. They certainly have a lot of power to keep things from happening. They have enormous power as a spoiler. But whether they think they have an option of a stable situation with the government they would consider friendly, that I don't know. MICHAEL MORELL: We're shifting back towards big power competition with China and Russia. Does Afghanistan play any role in that competition? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: Yes, it has threat potential for both China and Russia. I think both know it. I don't think that's a threat potential that we have any ability to exploit. Secondly, as Russia plays the new great game and wants to be a large power, it has been using the Afghan situation to expand its prestige by hosting conferences. I don't think Russia has much ability to make peace with Afghanistan. It has some ability to be a spoiler. MICHAEL MORELL: Where are you on this debate about whether the Taliban is serious when it says it will not allow extremist organizations to use Afghanistan as a launching point for attacks? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: I don't believe it. It might be true; the evidence is limited. But I think you have to ask, if the Taliban is really serious about that then why would it not be willing to even say in an agreement that it will break with al-Qaida? The Taliban would only go with this very vague language that it can walk around. Secondly, al-Qaida has a very tight link with the Haqqani movement. The Haqqani movement is part of the Taliban. So Taliban has some real problems. One of the things you saw when the contents of Osama bin Laden's computers were being declassified to some extent. At one point there was a message from Osama bin Laden to somebody saying that he was nervous about the Taliban's position towards al-Qaida but 'go check with the Haqqani movement, because we've got good friends there and they'll give us a good read.'\u00a0 That's an interesting illustration of how tight the al-Qaida and Haqqani movement relationship was, and as far as I know, still is.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: What do you see as the strategic options going forward? Which one would you recommend to a President Biden? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: There is broad agreement that the best option would be a negotiated peace. We're trying that and we should continue to support that. The real strategic questions I think that the Biden administration has to deal with are, 'how do you support such a peace agreement or such a peace process? How do you posture yourself if you can't have that?' It's not at all clear that such a peace process will work. I think the two come together in a very unsatisfactory way, in a long-term maintenance policy. And people won't like that. They want a clear end. They want a clear exit route. I understand that. I think you have a choice between helping failure or giving yourself a chance at a long-term success. On the one hand, the way you advance the peace process, paradoxically, is to support the war because the Taliban will only make peace if they don't think they have a choice of military victory. If we're really in a hurry to run and go, all we're doing is saying to them that they have no reason to make concessions. The second thing is that we can sustain Afghanistan now at what amounts to a low cost compared to the days of big war. We are losing a few people in Afghanistan, less than 20 a year, which is serious. Its loss of life. But it's fewer than we lose in noncombat training incidents. It costs us about 1% to 1.5 % of the defense budget. This is real money, but these are long term sustainable costs. Frankly, unless you have a way of producing peace like a rabbit out of a hat, which we don't, then you need to understand that it is a steady as you go kind of policy where you look at what is the lowest number of troops and the lowest cost that has long term sustainability. That creates a situation that everybody else has to acknowledge and deal with instead of what you have now, which is a constant return to policy re-examination, troops that are pulled out with no strategic rationale, nobody in the world knowing what the hell you're going to do next, and the complete sense of insecurity. MICHAEL MORELL: What happens if that doesn't work. For whatever reason, we can't convince the American people that strategy makes sense to them and they continue to want to bring troops home. What happens if we leave and there is this instability you talk about? What does Afghanistan look like if we don't get this right? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: If we don't get this right, we leave. NATO leaves because NATO can't stay without us. There are lots of people in Afghanistan, particularly the ethnic minorities, some of which are very large, which have experienced the terror and horror of living under the Taliban and are prepared to continue fighting to prevent that, whether or not the Afghan army holds together. If we leave, particularly if we pull our money out, the Afghan army is likely to fragment because they can't afford it. But lots of pieces of that army will continue in a war. That is where you move from an insurgency against a government to something that I would call a civil war. A civil war will then pull in outside powers because they all have things to protect. Iran, Russia, and China, they will all find that the way to protect their borders from people like the Islamic State is to intervene and support groups in Afghanistan. That gives you a rolling civil war that will continue for an indefinite period of time. That leaves lots of room for al-Qaida to broaden its presence for the Islamic State, ISIS, which is there to broaden its presence and for its physical strategic threat to the United States to grow because they are looking for vengeance. Secondly, you are going to have a sense that the Islamic warriors have defeated the second superpower. 'This is proof that God is really on their side.' And that much more confidence to go on for the next 50 years of war with both the Islamic State and al-Qaida. MICHAEL MORELL: Our objectives in Afghanistan started pretty narrow and then they broadened. With 20/20 hindsight, was that the right thing to do?\u00a0 AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: I think they got too broad, but it is a lot easier to make that criticism than it is to go backwards and say, 'what were your real choices?' I suppose we could have just said, 'OK, we kicked the Taliban out. Now we're going to let it go back to civil war. We're out of here.' But realistically, I think you get into a position, 'OK, you busted it. You got to put something in place.' Therefore, you have a political negotiation. Once you say you want to keep the Taliban down, then you need an army. Then for an army, you need a state. And for a state, you need a budget and an economy. These things drive you into state building.\u00a0 I don't think we recognize the logic of this. You tend to do these things a step at a time. There's a tale for the future that it's really hard to have a limited goal once you overthrow a country and take over. In retrospect, sure, we got too broad in the democracy and too far drawn in. In any event, I think our bigger problem has not been the broadening of goals, but the constant shifting of goals.\u00a0 By my count, I see two major policies in the Bush administration, five in the Obama administration, at least two blending into an incoherent third one in the Trump administration. On average, we can't go more than about two years without wanting to change our mind and go someplace else and deal with really hard situations in the world where you have to bring a lot of other people on board and have a consistent direction. You really are going to screw it up if you insist on changing your mind every couple of years. MICHAEL MORELL: Of all the things that you know about Afghanistan, if you could tell Joe Biden only one, what would it be? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: I wish I had the golden answer. I would like to tell him first that you can lose this, but you don't have to. You can sustain a presence. I know you'll hate it because a muddle through policy, but you can actually make that work. You don't have any major political pressure to get out and your choices are between that messy, undesirable world and just losing. That's a choice that you will probably fight and look every which way to see. Isn't there a better solution? Isn't there a plan B that gives me what I want? I think the answer is no, you haven't got a plan B. Those are your choices and it would be better not to lose. MICHAEL MORELL: Mr. Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us. If you want to mention one more time those podcasts from your Academy? AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN: One is called The General and The Ambassador. It goes from Petraeus and Crocker right up to today. The other one is called American Diplomat. If you really want a full scale understanding of what diplomats really do or what the life is like, I commend that one.\u00a0",

They discuss the advancement of North Korea's nuclear missile program as U.S. attempts to negotiate denuclearization have halted. Terry is concerned about possible North Korean provocation during the Biden administration transition.

Obviously, one of those is North Korea. Give us a 50,000 foot summary of where President Obama left the North Korea issue in January of 2017, and what happened during the Trump administration. SUE MI TERRY: President Obama pursued what the administration calls strategic patience policy. President Obama did not really talk to Kim Jong-un. There was not an active conversation or negotiation towards the end. He pursued a sanctions policy primarily because -- I think it was Bob Gates a long time ago who said 'we're not going to buy the same horse for the third time.' Meaning that we negotiated with North Korea. We had a framework during the Clinton administration. We had six party talks during the Bush administration. And we're not going to just return to negotiations. President Obama and the administration wanted to get away from this cycle that North Korea was engaged in. Provocation, then negotiation, then concessions, then provocation-- this whole cycle.\u00a0 North Korea kept building their nuclear missile program. That's one criticism of the strategic patience policy because it didn't stop North Korea from building its nuclear missile program.\u00a0 So, when President Trump came in, he pursued what he called maximum pressure policy, really tightening sanctions. The whole idea was to pressure and squeeze North Korea. It was a lot of a fire and fury rhetoric and calling Kim Jong-un a rocket man on a suicide mission. We even saw China really implementing sanctions in the fall of 2017, which was surprising to a lot of Korea watchers. We saw China putting more pressure on North Korea, probably because China was stressed that the Trump administration might actually be going the route of a preventive strike. Remember, there was three intercontinental ballistic missile tests, ICBM tests, six nuclear tests in 2017. When we were at the end of 2017, early 2018, all of a sudden, Kim Jong-un abruptly shifted to diplomacy and summitry, starting with participating in the Winter Olympics in South Korea, which then paved the way to having these summits, starting with the Singapore summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. So we had maximum pressure policy in 2017 shifting to summitry and diplomacy. President Trump and Kim Jong Un met three times. But at the end of the day. Their nuclear and missile programs are even more advanced, and we have not made any progress on the denuclearization front. MICHAEL MORELL: How would you characterize the threat? How would you characterize the relationship between the United States and North Korea, the relationship between North Korea and South Korea?\u00a0 SUE MI TERRY: President Trump and Kim Jong-un actually have a personal relationship, it seems like they've exchanged many love letters, beautiful letters.\u00a0 But if you followed this parade that the North Koreans had on October 10th, what we saw in that parade was quite significant. It was really something unprecedented on many levels. We saw more North Korean technology, both conventional and WMD than ever before. It was truly impressive. We saw everything from this new technology, anti-air defense radar system, to anti-tank guided missiles, to SLBM and this new strategic weapon that Kim Jong-un had said himself that he was going to reveal this year, which turned out to be indeed a monster size ICBM. Korea watchers are now calling it Hwasong 16, which is the largest liquid propellant road mobile ICBM anywhere in the world with capacity to hold as much as triple the payload. The nuclear missile program made incredible progress. North Korea's made incredible progress in the past several years on their nuclear missile program and their delivery system.\u00a0 The main message from the North Koreans is that they've made these impressive breakthroughs despite sanctions on North Korea, despite the very difficult domestic situation that they are in right now in terms of economically with sanctions and these measures they took to prevent covid and typhoons. The message that North Koreans were sending is that time is on their side. And in fact, Kim Jong-un himself gave this very emotional speech saying that time is by the North Korean side.\u00a0 So, there is a personal relationship between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, but their nuclear missile program made incredible progress. In terms of North Korea-South Korea relationship. President Moon Jae-in really wants to make progress. He is desperate to have a big breakthrough with North Korea. But at the end of the day, unless there is a breakthrough between the United States and North Korea, there's a limit to what South Koreans can do. They can't open the Kaesong industrial complex because of international sanctions in place. So President Moon Jae-in is very frustrated, and South Koreans feel like they don't have a whole lot of time left right now to make progress on North Korea.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: How does Kim Jong-un see us? Has that changed at all in the last four years? Second, what does he see as the strategic purpose of having nuclear weapons and ICBMs to deliver them? SUE MI TERRY: Let me answer the latter question first. From Kim Jong-un's perspective or the North Korean perspective, they pursued nuclear weapons for a very long time. This program really began in the 50s and continued to the 80s. They pursed it for a very long time because they see it as the ultimate deterrence against the United States. Even a superpower like the United States cannot attack North Korea if they are armed with the ultimate weapon, nuclear weapons. They pursued nuclear weapons for deterrence. What they truly want, the overarching goal, is regime survival. Nuclear weapons serve that purpose. With nuclear weapons they can deter the United States or any other threat. Nuclear weapons also give Kim Jong-un North Korean regime legitimacy. It is a rallying card. With nuclear weapons, they can rally the people. It is a source of pride for the North Koreans. It justifies all the deprivations that those people have to go through because 'we at least are a nuclear weapons power.' It gives North Korea prestige.\u00a0 What is North Korea without nuclear weapons? It is the 197th ranked economy in the world. Without nuclear weapons, what is it? Nobody would pay attention. So they have influence in regional affairs or possibly world affairs because they have nuclear weapons. Finally, in terms of conventional power, they have already lost to South Korea. South Korea is an ultimate rival state that exists just south of the border. In that rivalry, you also need to have nuclear weapons because that is the only way to beat South Korea. There is a whole host of reasons why they've been pursuing nuclear weapons. In terms of your second question on how North Korea sees the United States, I think fundamentally, the United States is their number one threat. They call the United States the number one hostile country to North Korea. They don't trust Americans. I had North Koreans tell me this in 1.5 track meetings, that even when they have a deal with the United States, they know that administration could change and the policy could change. They had this experience under the Clinton administration in 1994. They had an agreed framework. Kim Jong Il was supposed to even come to the United States or Clinton was supposed to go to North Korea to have a meeting.\u00a0 But time ran out and the Bush administration came in. From North Korean perspective, the Bush administration pursued a so-called hard line policy and everything fell apart, which is not true, because we also found out at that time around 2002 that North Korea was pursuing uranium enrichment program separately. There's a fundamental trust issue on both sides. They don't trust us and obviously we don't trust them.\u00a0 We have tried almost everything under the sun when it comes to North Korea. Bilateral talks, multilateral talks. We had agreements with North Korea. I think there's a trust deficit between the United States and North Korea. MICHAEL MORELL: What do you think our policy objectives should be vis-a-vis North Korea? Is it just denuclearization or is it broader than that?\u00a0 SUE MI TERRY: It's really hard because I think we should not give up seeking denuclearization of North Korea as a goal, but I'm not sure if it's achievable because I think almost everybody can agree that North Korea is not going to give up their nuclear weapons. I don't see a scenario in which they would give it up. Even with maximum sanctions placed on North Korea, the most we can get out of North Korea is some sort of a deal that caps their program where they say they will give it up but we know they have some nuclear weapons.\u00a0 And that's OK with us. That's a realistic goal. But that's something still worth pursuing. Longer term, I think we need to pay attention to potentially seeking unification of the Korean peninsula. Not that the we actively seek it, because it's up to the the two Koreas, obviously. But we need to think strategically about if a unified Korea is in United States interests, which I think it is. That's a long term goal that we should keep in mind. MICHAEL MORELL: What should be our strategy? What would you advise President Biden to do about North Korea? SUE MI TERRY: It's truly a difficult case. Even the most well intentioned folks can't come to an agreement. We've been working towards having some sort of deal with North Korea for many, many years. We had deals with North Korea. Every single deal fell apart over verification. Now the key question is whether the priority should be verifiably capping their fissile material and capping their program. They've been making tremendous advancement under both nuclear and missile programs.\u00a0 So, whether we should go for a freeze deal: I think the Biden administration should be at least open to potentially having some sort of a deal. But it all depends on how the North Koreans react going forward. I'm very concerned that the North Koreans will revert to provocation now that we have President Elect Biden. There's always a provocation cycle. Historically with the North Koreans, there is a provocation that's bracketed around the election. Historically, the North Koreans like to conduct a provocation to get the attention of Washington, to gain leverage in negotiation. I'm so concerned that they will test this Hwasong 16 missile that we saw October 10th. In that case, we have no other option but to continue with sanctions, trying to implement sanctions, trying to get other countries to implement sanction. It depends on North Korea's reaction. In the immediate term, we need to send a signal to North Korea to not conduct a provocation. To not return to the early days when President Obama came to office and North Korea conducted a series of provocations in the first four months of the Obama administration, which led to the strategic patience. We need to send a message to the North Koreans to buy some time, because once they conduct this provocation, we have no option but to continue with sanctions.\u00a0 Meanwhile, we should be open to possibly having a dialogue with North Korea, starting with working level talks. I don't think the Biden administration would be eager to engage in any kind of summitry, pageantry or theatrics. It'll be very different with President Biden. He will be more in favor of pursuing a traditional working level diplomacy, empowering negotiators. I think that's the right approach. Extending a handout to North Korea to say we are interested in restarting talks, but it really also depends on North Korea's reaction and how they conduct themselves in the next months to come. MICHAEL MORELL: It seems to me like we've got two options here. One is some sort of a freeze deal. The other is keeping the maximum pressure on and demanding denuclearization. I don't believe there's a military option here in terms of disarming them. I'd like to get your take on that. But why does it make sense to go down the the freeze approach, a negotiation that freezes their program vice just keeping the pressure on vice some sort of military option?\u00a0 SUE MI TERRY: I don't think military option exists in the Korean Peninsula, so I can't even contemplate that. We always have to say all options on the table. But realistically, the military option is not on the table because the consequence of having a conflict on the Korean peninsula is enormous. I am was somebody who was always for maximum pressure. I thought that was the best approach.\u00a0 I still believe that we need to put pressure on this until there is a deal that we can live with. There was no other option. It's the only leverage we got. The issue is we need for maximum pressure to work. It did sort of work in 2017 before President Trump abruptly shifted. We should actually continue maximum pressure minus the rhetoric in 2017 because we actually had China and other countries implementing sanctions.\u00a0 The problem now going forward is that particularly given the U.S. China conflict and the Cold War between U.S. and China, why would China have any incentive to implement sanctions? We've only seen loosening of sanctions implementation. This was the problem of just turning to diplomacy and summitry and meeting with Kim Jong-un without having really worked out all the problems, because now Xi Jinping has met with Kim Jong-un four times.\u00a0 The China-North Korea relationship is better than ever. Just recently, they've exchanged letters between Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un with rhetoric around the Korean War that was very positive. So this is a closer relationship. Sanctions are not going to truly get North Korea to come back unless sanctions are implemented like Iran style sanction. Secondary boycott, implementation of sanctions, really harsh sanctions like we did with Iran. It took about three years of really hard sanctions on Iran for Iran to turn back to negotiation. That's the problem.\u00a0 To summarize, I still think we have to put maximum pressure until there is a deal that we can live with. I'm a little bit more hardline. There are a lot of folks who says we just need any kind of cap deal. I don't. I think for us to even have a freeze deal, we have to get a couple of things, which is going to be very hard to get. We need North Korea to at least give us some sort of inventory of its nuclear program to show that they intend to freeze or cap their program. They need to agree to international verification otherwise we would be trading sanctions concessions in return for nothing.\u00a0 That's going to be hard. So, in theory, I think we can get to a first deal. But it's going to be a hard road to even get there. Until we get there, we don't really have this brilliant solution that's out there that no one has ever thought of. The only thing we can do is continue to apply pressure until we can get to this kind of deal that it's at least a starting point. MICHAEL MORELL: If they were willing to give us a verifiable declaration of what they have, both in terms of the nuclear program and their missile program, and if they agreed to a verifiable freeze of those programs, would you be willing to get rid of all the sanctions or just part of them? SUE MI TERRY: You are asking the toughest questions. This is the chief challenge for us. North Korea is highly unlikely to agree to any sort of agreement that does not include maximal sanctions relief. They are going to try to do that without offering the kind of verification that would be needed even for a nuclear freeze deal. This is why the talks in Hanoi fell apart. The President Trump and Kim Jong-un meeting in Hanoi. Because the Yongbyon nuclear facility, which the North Koreans offered us, was an important but it was only one of many North Korean facilities. We felt that was not good enough to give North Koreans these maximum sanctions relief that they are looking for. So, no, I don't think we have to lift sanctions. 'If we can get international verification. They give us a true declaration, and we can get international inspectors to verify. Maybe we can agree to significant sanctions relief.' Not all. Because what they are going to ask for is maximum sanctions relief. MICHAEL MORELL: What about normalization of relations? Is that something you would consider? SUE MI TERRY: Yes. At least a peace declaration, not a peace treaty. A peace declaration is mostly a symbolic way to say the war is over. I do think the Trump administration was ready to offer that in Hanoi: exchange of liaison offices and a peace declaration.\u00a0 But what the North Koreans wanted was sanctions relief. So that's the problem. That's what the negotiators have to figure out: how much sanctions relief to give North Korea for an internationally verifiable freeze of their nuclear program. The problem of just doing sanctions and not talking to them and not considering the cap is that, as we've seen in the past few years, they have a really advanced a nuclear missile program. They mass produce. That's going to be a problem because we have to worry about the proliferation risk of that. MICHAEL MORELL: If we end up with a freeze deal and we provide at least some sanctions relief, how do you think about the signal that sends to other countries that North Korea at the end of the day, was successful in getting what it wanted? SUE MI TERRY: It's a terrible message, but there's no perfect solution. It's a terrible message because you're sending a message to all the countries out there who want to pursue nuclear weapons that all you have to do is keep at it and they will get to basically international acceptance like North Korea as a nuclear weapons power. Because what the North Koreans want is arms control negotiation, but to be treated like a nuclear weapons power. So it's not a great message. I'm not suggesting this is a great solution. There is no great solution. There is no good solution at all. But all I'm saying now is that I have shifted a little bit from just maximum pressure and secondary boycott and all of that. Now to realistically, just consider- this is what the Biden administration needs to do. They will need to have a policy review and they need to consider whether it is worthwhile to give some targeted sanctions relief\u00a0 in exchange for a genuine freeze of their nuclear missile program as an interim first step with the goal of moving toward verified dismantlement of some important facilities and nuclear weapons. Whether this is better than allowing the North to grow its program unchecked as it is currently doing. That's the deliberation. MICHAEL MORELL: Walk me through how the other key countries here, China, South Korea, Japan, Russia, would think about what you just outlined?\u00a0 SUE MI TERRY: In general, I think all countries in the region would welcome that except Japan. South Korea doesn't even want to for us to be this hard about needing a verifiable declaration. They really want a deal. That's very candidly speaking. That's where they are with North Koreans. They want to make progress with the North Koreans. They want to make a breakthrough. And they even say 'you're demanding too much because the North Koreans are never going to give a verifiable declaration and so on.' They're already pushing for sanctions relief. So the Moon administration is already there. China, Russia, they're already pressing for sanctions relief when North Korea has not done anything. They have not taken one step towards denuclearization. And they're already pressing for sanctions relief. Last year, they even put a draft UN resolution, they were seeking sanctions relief. The region wants a deal with North Korea. Now, Japan is the one country that doesn't want that. Japan is arguably even more hardline than the United States. And former Prime Minister Abe- when you read Bolton's memoir, you can see that he is the one who sort of whispered to President Trump's ear to say, 'We have to stay strong. We cannot have another bad deal with North Korea.' So they will remain hardline on this because, they are worried about repeated cycles of missiles and nuclear testing. Obviously, all the missiles fly over Japan. They're worried about their abduction issue. They've been always concerned about not having any kind of progress on the abduction issue. North Koreans kidnapped Japanese citizens during the 70s and 80s. This still remains a top priority for Japan. So they would not want the U.S. to give any kind of sanctions relief or sign on to any kind of bad freeze deal. I think the region is united except Japan in terms of wanting some sort of breakthrough. South Korea, China, and Russia are going to push for us to accept any sort of deal, not even the one I outlined. Any kind of deal would be good for them. MICHAEL MORELL: My sense is that Kim was behaving himself vis a vis Donald Trump because he felt that he still had some hope of convincing President Trump to do sanctions relief without having to give up much of his program. But with President Biden coming in now, and President Biden sounding right now like he might go back to President Obama's strategy of kind of ignoring them. It does raise the risk of a North Korean provocation. What would your advice be to the administration with regard to reaching out to North Korea?\u00a0 Is there a way to manage this so that they don't do a provocation in the short term just because they think President Biden is going to go back to where President Obama was? SUE MI TERRY: Yes, I think that's important. At least we have a communication channel with North Koreans. South Koreans can play a role because South Koreans are very concerned that there would be a provocation. Then we're basically going back to strategic patience 2.0. So South Koreans have already been talking to North Koreans. There are a lot of ways to convey that message 'to hold on, let's not repeat what happened during the Obama administration.' When Vice President Elect Biden in the third debate with President Trump, called Kim Jong-un a thug. I'm sure North Koreans are not happy with that. But I was surprised to see the North Koreans didn't come back with this horrible rhetoric that normally comes out of North Korea. Maybe they're also waiting to see what happens.\u00a0 Vice President Elect Biden also wrote a very unusual op-ed in a Korean news outlet, Yonhap, recently talking about alliance issues. His tone was milder than the one he used during the debate. Already there is a signal being sent. I think this is critical. In the short term, the first step is to prevent North Korea from conducting a major provocation. In terms of sanction, I am very wary of rushing into not a good deal with premature sanctions relief. History shows us the Kim family has been tempted to cheat or they did cheat on any deal. So if we grant mature sanctions relief, we're not going to get anything. We're not even going to get a genuine halt to North Korea's nuclear missile program. We have to be very careful. When I was suggesting some sort of deal, I'm still talking about achieving a genuine halt to North Korea's nuclear missile program. Not one where they say they will do that and we don't get it. Because then we don't have anything.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: If you could tell President-elect Biden one thing about North Korea that we haven't already talked about here, what would it be? SUE MI TERRY: He's been around. He, the administration, and the people who are going to be in charge of the Korea policy, they've been there. We've tried almost everything with North Korea. So it's going to be really hard. President Elect Biden, on the human rights angle, I think he's going to be tough on human rights. He understands a lot about North Korea. He understands foreign policy. I'm hard pressed to find something that he's not going to really know about North Korea. MICHAEL MORELL: If you could tell Kim Jong-un one thing about America what would it be? SUE MI TERRY: I think Kim Jong-un ultimately cannot achieve his desired goal. I believe that Kim Jong-un is different from his father and grandfather in the sense that it's beyond regional survival. I think he wants a better economy for North Korea. He's a young man. He wants to rule for many, many decades. But that's fundamentally never going to happen as long as he keeps this nuclear program. Kim Jong-un lost an opportunity with President Trump. There truly was an opportunity there. Fear is driving North Korea. Because of examples like Libya, what happened with Gaddafi, they believe United States cannot be trusted. But we have no desire to invade North Korea or attack North Korea. I think that's what he needs to think about. But I don't know how we can ever convince the North Koreans of that.\u00a0 That we would never treat North Korea like Libya or Iraq. It's a fundamentally different situation. MICHAEL MORELL: Do you see him maturing as he gets older and has more experience? SUE MI TERRY: I am not sure about maturing, but we cannot simply say the North Korean regime was always this way. I do think Kim Jong-un is different from his father, even just his speech. In a speech he gave on October 10th, he was emotional. He was almost teary. Maybe that's just being a shrewd leader. But he's savvy. He's different. I think we've seen that with the last three Trump-Kim summits and meetings. I do think he's a smart guy. I think the Korea watchers have underestimated him when he first came into power right away. He's savvy. He's different. I'm not sure about maturing necessarily. He did have truly a unique opportunity with President Trump. From North Korean perspective, they should have gone for a deal. MICHAEL MORELL: Thank you so much for joining us as always. It's a fascinating discussion, and we look forward to more in the future.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 In remarks that closed out the third night of the Republican National Convention, Vice President Mike Pence highlighted the challenges that have roiled the nation this year and cast the November election as an opportunity for voters to decide who will carry them through when the nation is tested. After his speech, President Trump made a surprise appearance as they listened to country singer Trace Adkins sing the national anthem.\u00a0 \"On November 3rd, you need to ask yourself: Who do you trust to rebuild this economy?\u00a0 A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world,\" he said. \"The choice is clear: To bring America all the way back, we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\" Pence delivered his remarks from Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland, the site of the 1812 battle that inspired the national anthem.\u00a0 \"In these challenging times our country needs a president who believes in America, who believes in the boundless capacity of the American people to meet any challenge, defeat any foe, and defend the freedoms we all hold dear,\" Pence said. \"America needs four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\" Pence became the first speaker Wednesday night to mention the violence and unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which was sparked when a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, in the back. But the vice president made no mention of Blake, who is partially paralyzed, fighting for life in the hospital. Pence also made no mention of any other Black American injured or killed by police this year, or of greater racial unrest and division in America.\u00a0 Good evening, America.\u00a0It is an honor to speak to you tonight from the hallowed grounds of Fort McHenry. The site of the very battle that inspired the words of our national anthem.\u00a0Those words have inspired this Land of Heroes ever since.\u00a0It was on this site 206 years ago when our young Republic\u00a0 heroically withstood a ferocious naval bombardment from the most powerful empire on earth.\u00a0\u00a0They came to crush our revolution, to divide our nation, and to end the American experiment.\u00a0The heroes who held this fort took their stand for Life, liberty, freedom and the American flag. Those ideals have defined our nation.\u00a0Yet they were hardly ever mentioned during last week's Democratic Convention.\u00a0Instead, Democrats spent four days attacking America. Joe Biden said we were living through a \"season of American darkness.\"But as President Trump said, \"where Joe Biden sees American darkness, we see American greatness.\"\u00a0In these challenging times\u2026 our country needs a president who believes in America. Who believes in the boundless capacity of the American people to meet any challenge, defeat any foe, and defend the freedoms we all hold dear...America needs four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House!\u00a0Before I begin, allow me to say a word to the families and communities in the path of hurricane Laura.\u00a0\u00a0Our administration is working closely with authorities in the states that will be impacted and FEMA has mobilized resources and supplies for those in harm's way. This is a serious storm. We urge all those in the affected areas to heed state and local authorities.\u00a0\u00a0Stay safe, and know that we'll be with you every step of the way to support, rescue, response, and recovery in the days and weeks ahead.\u00a0Four years ago, I answered the call to join this ticket because I knew that Donald Trump had leadership and the vision to make America great again.\u00a0\u00a0For the last four years, I have watched this President endure unrelenting attacks and get up every day and fight to keep the promises he made to the American people.\u00a0So, with gratitude for the confidence President Donald Trump has placed in me, the support of our Republican party, and the grace of God, I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as Vice President of the United States.\u00a0Serving the American people in this office has been a journey I never expected.\u00a0 A journey that would not be possible without the support of my family, beginning with my wonderful wife Karen, a lifelong school teacher, an incredible mother to our three children and an outstanding Second lady of the United States. And WE couldn't be more proud of our three children: Marine Corp Captain Michael J. Pence, his wife Sarah, our daughter Charlotte Pence Bond, author and wife to Lieutenant Henry Bond, who is currently deployed and serving our nation in the United States Navy and our recent law school graduate daughter Audrey and her fianc\u00e9e, who like so many other Americans, had to delay their wedding this summer, but we can't wait for Dan to be a part of our family. In addition to my wife and kids, the person who shaped my life the most is also with us tonight, my mom Nancy. She's the daughter of an Irish immigrant, 87 years young, mom follows politics closely. And truth be told, sometimes I think I'm actually her second-favorite candidate on the Trump-Pence ticket. To mom and to my father looking down, thank you, I love you.\u00a0Over the past four years, I've worked closely with our President. I've seen him when the cameras are off. Americans see President Trump in lots of different ways but there's no doubt how President Trump sees America. He sees America for what it is... a nation that has done more good in this world than any other . . . a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance . . . and if you want\u00a0 a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted, then he's not your man.\u00a0We came by very different routes to this partnership and some people think we're a little bit different. But I've learned a few things watching him deal with all we've been through these past four years.\u00a0 He does things his own way, on his own terms.\u00a0 Not much gets past him and when he has an opinion, he's liable to share it. He's certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly, he's kept his word.\u00a0 In a city known for talkers\u2026President Donald Trump is a doer. Few presidents have brought more independence, energy, and determination to that office.\u00a0Four years ago we inherited a military hollowed out\u00a0 by devastating\u00a0 budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the great depression\u2026 ISIS controlled a land mass twice the size of Pennsylvania and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values like freedom of religion, and the right to life.\u00a0That's when President Trump stepped in.\u00a0\u00a0From Day one, he kept his word. He rebuilt our military, created the Space Force, the first new branch of our armed forces in 70 years\u2026 and we returned American astronauts to space on an American rocket for the first time in nearly a decade.\u00a0And after years of scandal that robbed our veterans of the care they EARNED, President Trump kept his word. We reformed the VA \u2026 and veterans choice is now available to every veteran.\u00a0\u00a0Our armed forces and our veterans fill this land of heroes and this historic fort. Tonight we have among us.. four recipients of the Medal of Honor\u2026 6 recipients of the Purple Heart and a Gold Star mother, of a gallant Navy SEAL \u2026 wounded warriors from Soldier Strong, a group that serves injured veterans \u2026 We're honored by your presence. Thank you for your service.\u00a0\u00a0With heroes just like these we defend this nation everyday and we've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil.\u00a0Last year, American armed forces took the last inch of ISIS territory, crushed their caliphate and took down their leader without one American casualty. Earlier this year, I was there when President Trump gave the order to take out the world's most dangerous terrorist.Iran's top general will never harm another American again because Qassem Soleimani is gone.\u00a0My fellow Americans you deserve to know,Joe Biden criticized President Trump following his decision to rid the world of both of those terrorists. But it's not surprising because history records that Joe Biden even opposed the operation that took down Osama Bin Laden.\u00a0It's no wonder Bob Gates, Secretary of defense under the Obama Biden Administration said Joe Biden had \"been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\"\u00a0So, we've stood up to our enemies and we've stood with our allies.\u00a0\u00a0Like when President Trump kept his word and moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel, setting the stage for the first Arab country to recognize Israel in 26 years.\u00a0\u00a0And closer to home, appointed more than 200 conservative judges to our federal courts, supported the right to life and all our God given liberties including the second amendment right to keep and bear arms.\u00a0But when it came to the economy, President Trump kept his word and then some...to pass the largest tax cut and reform in American history, rolled back more federal red tape than any admin, unleashed American energy and fought for free and fair trade.\u00a0in our first three years, Businesses large and small created more than 7 million jobs, including 500,00 manufacturing jobs. America became a net exporter of energy for first time in 70 years.\u00a0Under President Trump, unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, hit their lowest levels ever!\u00a0On this 100th anniversary of women's right to vote, I'm proud to report that under President Donald Trump we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for women in 65 years and more Americans were working than ever before.\u00a0In our first three years, we built the greatest economy in the world. We made America great again.\u00a0\u00a0And then the coronavirus struck from China.\u00a0Before the first case of coronavirus spread within the United States, President Trump took the unprecedented step of suspending all travel from China.\u00a0That action saved an untold number of American lives.\u00a0 And bought us time to launch the greatest national mobilization since World War II. President Trump marshaled the full resources of the federal government and directed us to forge seamless partnerships with governors across America in both parties. We partnered with private industry to reinvent testing and produce supplies and we're now conducting 800,000 tests per day... have coordinated the delivery of billions of pieces of Personal Protective Equipment\u2026 And we saw to the manufacture of 100,000 ventilators in 100 days. And no who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. We built hospitals, we surged military medical personnel and enacted an economic rescue package that saved 50 million American jobs.\u00a0\u00a0As we speak we're developing a growing number of treatments, including convalescent plasma that are saving lives all across the country. Last week, Joe Biden said \"no miracle is coming.\" What Joe doesn't seem to understand is that America is a nation of miracles and we're on track to have the world's first safe, effective coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year. \u00a0\u00a0After all the sacrifice in this\u2026 year like no other \u2013 all the hardship\u2013 we are finding our way forward again. \u00a0But tonight, our hearts are with all the families who have lost loved ones. We mourn with those who mourn, and we grieve with those who grieve. And this night I know millions of Americans will pause and pray for God's comfort to each of you.\u00a0A country doesn't get through such a time unless its people find the strength within. The response by doctors, nurses, first responders, farmers, factory workers, truckers, and everyday Americans who are putting the health and safety of their neighbors first has been nothing short of heroic.\u00a0Veronica Sayez put on her scrubs and went into work day in and day out in one of New York's busiest hospitals. She stayed on the job until it was done. Her brother William is a New York City firefighter. and they're emblematic of heroes all across this country. You've earned the admiration of your fellow Americans, and the thanks of a grateful nation.\u00a0Thanks to the courage and compassion of the American people, we are slowing the spread, we are protecting the vulnerable, we are saving lives, and we are opening up American again.\u00a0Because of the strong foundation that President Trump poured in our first three years, we've already gained back 9.3 million jobs over the last three months. And we're not just opening up America again\u2014we're re-opening America's schools. I'm proud to report that my wife Karen, a lifelong school teacher, will be returning to her classroom next week.\u00a0To all the heroic teachers, faculty, and staff\u2026You have our thanks.\u00a0In the days ahead, as we open up America again and open up America's schools, I promise you we'll continue to put the health of America first. And as we work to bring this economy back, we all have a role to play and we all have a choice to make.\u00a0\u00a0On November 3rd, you need to ask yourself: Who do you trust to rebuild this economy?\u00a0 A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world.\u00a0The choice is clear to bring America all the way back, we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\u00a0My fellow Americans, we are passing through a time of testing. For in the midst of this global pandemic, just as our nation has begun to recover, we've seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities.\u00a0President Donald Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest, but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest, tearing down statues is not free speech. Those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u00a0Last week, Joe Biden didn't say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country.\u00a0Let ME be clear: the violence must STOP \u2013 whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha.Too many heroes have died defending our freedoms to see Americans strike each other down.We will have law and order on the streets of America.President Trump and I know the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best of us. They put their lives on the line every day.\u00a0People like Dave Patrick Underwood was an officer of the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service, who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California. We are joined tonight by his sister Angela. Angela, we grieve for your family and are grateful for his service. And America will never forget Dave Patrick Underwood and his service and sacrifice to this nation.\u00a0The American people know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement, and standing with African American neighbors to improve the quality of life in our cities and towns.\u00a0From the first days of this administration, we have done both.And we will keep doing both for four more years in the White House.\u00a0Joe Biden says America is systemically racist.\u00a0 And that law enforcement in America has a, quote, \"implicit bias\" against minorities.\u00a0And when asked whether he'd support cutting funding to law enforcement, and he replied, \"Yes, absolutely.\"\u00a0Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to unsafe streets and violence in America's cities.\u00a0The hard truth is... you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. Under President Trump, we will stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line, and we're not going to defund the police \u2013 not now, not ever.\u00a0My fellow Americans, we are passing through a time of testing. Soon, we will come to a time for choosing.\u00a0\u00a0Joe Biden has referred to himself as a \"transition candidate.\"\u00a0 But many are asking: A transition to what? Last week, Democrats didn't talk much about their agenda, and if I were them, I wouldn't want to either.\u00a0\u00a0Bernie Sanders, did tell his followers that Joe Biden could be the most liberal President of modern times, and confirmed that, quote, \"Many of the ideas we fought for, that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream\" in the Democratic Party. \u00a0\u00a0At the root of their agenda, is the belief that America is driven by envy, not aspiration \u2014 that millions of Americans harbor ill-will toward their neighbors, instead of loving our neighbors as themselves.\u00a0 The radical left believes the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to correct those American wrongs. They believe the federal government needs to dictate how Americans live, how we should work, how we should raise our children \u2014 and, in the process, deprive our people of freedom, prosperity, and security. Their agenda is based on government control; our agenda is based on freedom. \u00a0\u00a0Where President Trump cut taxes\u2014Joe Biden wants to raise\u00a0 taxes by nearly $4 trillion.\u00a0\u00a0Where this President achieved energy independence for the United States.\u00a0 Joe Biden would abolish fossil fuels, end fracking, and impose a regime of climate change regulations that would drastically increase the cost of living for working families.\u00a0Where we fought for free and fair trade this President stood up to China and ended the era of economic surrender.\u00a0\u00a0Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China \u2013 wants to repeal all the tariffs that are leveling the playing field for American workers and actually criticized President Trump for suspending all travel from China at the outset of this pandemic.\u00a0Joe Biden is for open borders; sanctuary cities; and free lawyers and healthcare for illegal immigrants. President Trump has secured our southern border and built nearly 300 miles of the wall.\u00a0\u00a0sJoe Biden wants to end school choice.\u00a0 President Trump believes every parent should have the right to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income or area code.\u00a0\u00a0Joe Biden supports taxpayer funding of abortion right up to the moment of birth.President Donald Trump has been the most pro-life President in American history.\u00a0When you consider their agenda it's clear: Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for a radical left.\u00a0\u00a0The choice in this election has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher.\u00a0Last week, Joe Biden said democracy is on the ballot but the truth is\u2026 our economic recovery is on the ballot, law and order is on the ballot. But so are things far more fundamental and foundational to our country.\u00a0It's not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrat. The choice in this election Is whether America remains America. \u00a0\u00a0It's whether we will leave to our children and our grandchildren a country grounded in our highest ideals of freedom, free markets, and the unalienable right to life and liberty \u2014 or whether we will leave to our children and grandchildren a country that is fundamentally transformed into something else.\u00a0We stand at a crossroads, America.\u00a0President Trump set our nation on a path to freedom and opportunity from the very first day of this administration.\u00a0 But Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline.\u00a0President Donald Trump believes in America and the goodness of the American people, the boundless potential of every American to live out their dreams in freedom. Everyday, President Trump has been fighting to protect the promise of America. Every day our President has been fighting to expand the reach of the American dream. And on everyday President Donald Trump has been fighting for you. Now it's our turn to fight for him.\u00a0\u00a0On this night, in the company of heroes, I am deeply grateful for the privilege of serving as Vice President of this great nation. I pray to be worthy of it. And I will give that duty all that is in me.\u00a0\u00a0In the year 2020, the American people have had more than our share of challenges, but thankfully we have a President with the toughness, energy and resolve to see us through. Those traits run in our national character\u2026 as that invading force learned on approach to this fort on September 1814. Against fierce and sustained bombardment, our young country was defended by heroes, not so different from those with us tonight. The enemy was counting on them to quit. But they never did. Fort McHenry held. And when morning came our flag was still here.\u00a0My fellow Americans, we are going through a time of testing. But if you look through the fog of these challenging times, you will see\u2026 our flag is still there.\u00a0That star-spangled banner still waves ove'r the land of the free and the home of the brave. From these hallowed grounds, American patriots in generations gone by did their part to defend freedom. Now it's our turn.\u00a0\u00a0So let's run the race marked out for us. Let's fix our eyes on Old Glory and all she represents, fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire ...let's fix our eyes on the author and perfecter of our faith and freedom...and never forget that \"where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom,\" That means freedom always wins....\u00a0My fellow Americans, thank you for the honor of addressing you tonight and the opportunity to run and serve as your Vice President again. I leave here today inspired. And I leave here today more convinced than ever that we will do as Americans have done through our long and storied past, we will defend our freedom and way of life in November of 2020, we will re-elect our president and principled Republican leaders across this land...and with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, and Gods help...we will make America great again, again.\u00a0\u00a0May God Bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America.",

On this final weekend of the year on FACE THE NATION, it wouldn't be 2020 without last-minute breaking news. And there's a lot of it today. First, that early Christmas morning explosion that rocked the city of Nashville. We'll talk with the mayor of Nashville, John Cooper. Former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence Frank Figliuzzi will also be with us. Then, an update on the biggest story of the year: The COVID-19 pandemic. More than a million Americans have been vaccinated so far as coronavirus cases, deaths, and hospitalizations continue to climb dramatically. The governor of California says his state could see, quote, \"a surge on top of surge on top of a surge\" in the next two months, as millions of Americans ignore CDC recommendations to stay home this holiday season. We'll talk with former FDA commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. That massive aid bill negotiated by Congress and the administration has been torpedoed by the President. His refusal to sign is putting a staggering amount of financial aid in jeopardy just as struggling Americans need it the most. In these final weeks of the Trump administration, ironically, it's Democrats who are in agreement with Mister Trump on his demand for additional payments, which has split the President from most Republicans. One thing Americans are not divided on? 2020 will go down in history as one of the worst years ever, at least in our lifetime. With political and racial divisions plaguing our society, what can be done to unite the country? We'll have a discussion on race, leadership, and moving forward with our holiday book panel. We'll talk with Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist Isabel Wilkerson. Her new book is Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents. His Truth Is Marching On: John Lewis and the Power of Hope is the latest from presidential historian Jon Meacham. Susan Glasser, writer for The New Yorker, and her husband, chief White House correspondent for The New York Times Peter Baker, wrote The Man Who Ran Washington: The Life and Times of James A. Baker III. Plus, we'll talk with two Midwest governors, Michigan Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, and Ohio Republican Mike DeWine. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. There are only four and a half days left in 2020, and the wicked blow this year has dealt is not letting up. There have been more than eighty million cases of COVID-19 worldwide. Here in the U.S., we've seen nearly nineteen million infections, and more than three hundred and thirty-one thousand deaths. Los Angeles County alone is seeing a coronavirus death every ten minutes. Washington is quiet, as the President vacations at his golf resort in Florida, but yesterday jobless benefits for more than fourteen million Americans ran out, and the government could shut down just after midnight tomorrow if Mister Trump does not sign the COVID relief bill. This comes on top of the Christmas morning bombing in Nashville, which left three people hospitalized and decimated part of the city. We begin there this morning with CBS News correspondent Mola Lenghi. MOLA LENGHI (CBS News Correspondent/@MolaReports): Well, Margaret, there are more than two hundred fifty federal agents on the ground here in Nashville continuing to investigate. The FBI says they've received more than five hundred tips. And CBS News has learned they have zeroed in on a person of interest. (Begin VT) MOLA LENGHI: The day after an RV exploded in Nashville, leveling parts of downtown, federal agents raided a home tied to Anthony Quinn Warner, identified by the FBI as a person of interest in the blast. This Google Maps image is partly why the Feds ended up at the home just outside Nashville. Notice the RV parked behind the wood fence. Investigators believe it matches the description of the one used in the explosion. On Christmas morning, the RV was found blaring a recorded warning in ominous countdown. WOMAN (automated voice): If you can hear this message, evacuate now. MOLA LENGHI: In addition to three injuries, human remains were found around the scene. Now it's unclear to whom they belong, but authorities say possibly the suspect. DOUGLAS KORNESKI: We're working under that assumption and processing as such. MOLA LENGHI: At this point, the FBI says they do not believe there are any additional public threats. Parts of the downtown area remain a crime scene as investigators sweep through the streets for evidence, keeping an eye out for components of whatever caused this massive blast felt miles away. DON COCHRAN (U.S. Attorney): It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle created by a bomb that throws pieces of evidence across multiple city blocks. (End VT) MOLA LENGHI: Well, the RV exploded while park next to an AT&T transmission building, knocking out cell and Wi-Fi service in the area. The Fire Department here says it could take a couple more days for that to be restored. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mola Lenghi, thank you. We want to go now to the mayor of Nashville, John Cooper. Good morning to you, Mister Mayor. MAYOR JOHN COOPER (D-Nashville/@JohnCooper4Nash): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: CBS is reporting that a person of interest in this explosion has been identified. Is there any update yet on the motive behind this bombing or who carried it out? MAYOR JOHN COOPER: I think everybody feels like there is a lot of momentum behind the investigation, and I expect a lot of answers-- a lot of questions will be answered relatively soon. We've got hundreds of agents on the ground working very hard. MARGARET BRENNAN: The person of interest, CBS is reporting, is a Nashville area resident named Anthony Quinn Warner. He's been described as a sixty-three-year-old white man who had an RV similar to the one in the explosion. Do you know if he is the suspect and-- and what his status is? MAYOR JOHN COOPER: Well, I-- I know what you know, what the authorities are reporting to the public. Again, I just think there's a lot of momentum in the investigation and it's so-- I think there's a lot of public interest because it's so shocking that on Christmas morning, this time of greatest hope, you have a bombing, a deliberate bombing. How can this be? And the public I know is anxious to try to understand it better. MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, absolutely. You said that this was not typical of terrorism. You called it an infrastructure attack. What did you mean by that? MAYOR JOHN COOPER: Well, those of us in Nashville realize that on Second Avenue there is a big AT&T facility and the truck was parked adjacent to this large, historic AT&T facility, which happens to be in downtown Nashville, somewhat surprisingly. And to all of us locally, it feels like there has to be some connection with the AT&T facility and the site of the bombing. You know, and that-- that's just-- that's a bit of just local insight in it's got to have something to do with the infrastructure. MARGARET BRENNAN: We know service was knocked out in parts of Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky. MAYOR JOHN COOPER: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: This was far reaching. When will service be restored? And-- and do you also need help from the President, as the governor has asked? MAYOR JOHN COOPER: Yeah. Oh, absolutely. The governor and I have talked about this. The damage on Second Avenue is not dissimilar than what the tornado in-- inflicted on Nashville and bigger parts of Nashville rather than just on one street. And so we-- we're going to need to get this rebuilt. It's part of our historic identity of Nashville, this kind of late Victorian streetscape that ended up being bombed. And the businesses there, they've just-- going through COVID they've had the worst nine months that you could have as a business. And then now to be affected by a bombing. Of course, we're going to need help and we may need some help in re-hardening our infrastructure. Now, the AT&T building itself, I think a lot of it probably survived very well, but you have flooding after these events-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MAYOR JOHN COOPER: --that gathers in basements. And so some of the problem may have been the result of the cure than from the bombing itself. MARGARET BRENNAN: And how long before service is restored? MAYOR JOHN COOPER: Well, I know AT&T is working very hard and sent a lot of trucks to Nashville to get this back online. They'll have to tell you when it will be, but every-- everybody's working hard to solve the problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel confident that there is no ongoing threat to your city? MAYOR JOHN COOPER: I-- I feel confident in repeating what the authorities-- what the investigators said yesterday to Nashville, that they think that the threat is over, that-- that Nashville is safe, that there aren't any other bombs. I think they wouldn't have said that unless they were very confident that that is true. MARGARET BRENNAN: You also have an ongoing COVID spike in the state of Tennessee-- MAYOR JOHN COOPER: Hmm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that you're dealing with-- MAYOR JOHN COOPER: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and you're rolling out the COVID vaccine in your city. How is all of this coming together? Is it complicating the response? MAYOR JOHN COOPER: Well, this is our year of first responder. You know, we-- we've had a lot of brave nurses and doctors all year long. On Christmas Day, six incredibly heroic police officers get added to our roll of honor in Nashville for 2020. COVID, of course, makes everything harder. We are in the middle of a spike. It's hard to know post-Christmas where that-- those numbers are headed to. In Nashville, we've dealt with it reasonably well. We've had a mask mandate and we've had restrictions on gatherings and-- that have been going on for some time. It's part of how our businesses are suffering, our hospitality area, our-- the gatherings have been restricted and so the businesses that were bombed are still in the middle of having a COVID recovery. Again, it's part of needing response by the federal government, both from the bomb-- bombing and-- and for COVID also. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Mister Mayor, good luck and-- and good luck to everyone in your city. MAYOR JOHN COOPER: Oh, thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Frank Figliuzzi. He is the former assistant director for counterintelligence at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the author of the upcoming book, The FBI Way. He joins us from Houston. Good morning. FRANK FIGLIUZZI (Former FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence/@FrankFigliuzzi1): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: This was a significant explosive device detonated in a major U.S. metropolitan area, and, yet, there was no threat detected beforehand. How confident are you that there is no broader threat in the country? FRANK FIGLIUZZI: So my confidence comes out of the language that law enforcement has been using as recently as the press conference yesterday afternoon. When you hear law enforcement leaders say things like they're confident that the city is safe, that there is no additional threat, that there's no additional explosives attached to this incident, and that they're confident they will find out who did this, that's a code for we know who did it and we've got our man. And I say man because the statistics tell us that bombings are largely committed by men. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the person of interest that CBS News is reporting is Anthony Quinn Warner. Federal investigators are not calling him a suspect. Do you believe that he is? Do you know anything about him? FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Margaret, I-- I do from observations, experience and from talking to sources-- I do believe that we'll fairly quickly see Warner turned from person of interest to the subject of the investigation. And I think right now we're all waiting for DNA results of that tissue that we all heard has been found in and around the scene. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you believe that may be him? FRANK FIGLIUZZI: I think it's quite likely that this was a suicide mission for this individual. If there's any comfort to be taken here, it's that this may likely end up being not connected to a larger group or organization, international or domestic, but rather a personal, real or perceived, beef, acting out on something that may or may not relate to that AT&T building. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. FRANK FIGLIUZZI: It's going to be personal to him. The choice of Christmas morning, deserted street was not about hurting people or sending a political or ideological message, but rather some personal connection to that building, to Christmas Day or some other thing that caused him to act out. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know the governor of Tennessee described this as an attack and he said it was a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device. It blew up not just that RV, but it decimated at least forty-one buildings in the surrounding area. How easy is it to make a bomb of that scale and do it underneath the radar without law enforcement knowing this threat was there? FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yeah, I think this is a wake-up call and a warning for all of us about how vulnerable our infrastructure is, how relatively easy it is for a single individual to do this. Now, we've concentrated, post 9/11 on-- on getting our hands around all the chemical companies, mass orders of precursors for known explosives. And look what an individual can do on his or her own when they simply unmask quantities of things that are under the radar screen. So here's the takeaway with this. The public has to be extremely vigilant about those around them that are talking about acting out where that might be able to do this. Shop owners and companies who are seeing smaller orders of precursors, that's where our vulnerability-- our vulnerability is. And, Margaret, the-- the notion of a copycat seeing what's happened in Nashville and trying to do this themselves is very real. And we should be concerned about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But in your professional opinion, operation of this size, could it have been completely undertaken by a single actor? FRANK FIGLIUZZI: We saw this in the-- in the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. You'll remember Timothy McVeigh largely, perhaps, with one or two cohorts, did this entirely by himself, getting huge amounts of fertilizer. So the short answer is, yes, it can be done. It's not the last time we'll see this, but we're-- we should be thankful that this happened with-- with very few casualties. MARGARET BRENNAN: CBS is reporting this morning that witnesses told investigators, the individual here we're talking about, Mister Warner, may have had an issue with 5G technology and online conspiracy theories stemming from it. To you is that discernible intent here, and when you were talking about trying to figure out what motivates him and copycats, what are you most concerned about going forward? This is a pretty tense time in the country. FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yep. I don't have to tell you we're living in an incredibly politically charged environment. There's tremendous dangerous polarization and it's being fueled by social media, conspiracy theorists out there. And, yes, I'm aware that there are groups and individuals who seem to think that 5G technology might be the cause of COVID, that technology generally is targeting us. You'll find almost anything imaginable and unimaginable online, and it may be that this is how-- partially what drove this individual. And that's why we need to speak the truth about what 5G is, where COVID came from and all of this. But all of that increases the possibility of a copycat operator. And we've got to be extremely vigilant as we move into the next couple of weeks-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. FRANK FIGLIUZZI: --where we're going to see the nation increasingly polarized about election results and upcoming inauguration. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Frank Figliuzzi, thank you for your analysis. We will be right back with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He's also on the board at Pfizer and joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you. You predicted-- SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: You predicted last Sunday we'd have about three more weeks of increasing infections. We ask you every week, where are we at this point? What are you thinking now? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, there are signs that the number of new daily cases is starting to plateau. It might be an extended plateau, but we're seeing a leveling off in new cases right now. Some of that is the holiday effect. It's underreporting around the holidays. But there is a discernible trend that we were taking even into the holidays. But, once again, the number of hospitalizations and the number of deaths is likely to lag by about two to three weeks. So even if we start to see a plateau in cases and a decline in the first week in January, it's really not going to be towards the end of January that we start to see the burden on hospitals begin to lessen and we start to see deaths plateau. So we have a grim month ahead of us. We have a very difficult month ahead of us. And right now the cases are being led by the coasts: it's California, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey to some extent. When you look at the Midwest, when you look at the Great Lakes region, Illinois, Michigan, you're starting to see cases come down quite discernibly. So the places where the infection was first are now-- it's now slowing and it's the East Coast and the West Coast and Florida as well, where cases are still building. MARGARET BRENNAN: This was the deadliest week in the deadliest month for people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. We know vaccinations began there last Monday. How soon do you think it will be before we see that relief? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, vaccinations are going to take about three weeks to get through all the nursing homes. I mean, we will start to see some-- some indication that the vaccines are probably having an effect maybe as early as this week, because we know that immunity does start to kick in maybe a week after vaccination. They went into the skilled nursing facilities first and vaccinated there first so you have some of the highest risk people in those facilities. So that will start to have an impact on mortality trends with COVID. But, you know, it's coming late in the season and it's going to take a couple of weeks, maybe a week or ten days for partial immunity to kick in. And to get full immunity, especially in an older population, you really need the booster. We do see in a younger population more robust immunity after that first dose. But in the older populations, it really requires a second dose to get the full effects of the immunity from the vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: The President tweeted this morning, cases in California have risen despite the lockdown, yet, Florida and others are open and doing well. He seems to be encouraging the lifting of local restrictions. Is that medically advisable? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, Florida had seventeen thousand cases on the twenty-sixth. They have around twenty-one thousand deaths now. I think they're the fourth highest in the country in terms of the number of COVID deaths and the third highest in terms of the number of total cases. It is true that California is having a worse epidemic right now, although there's some signs that the epidemic may be plateauing in Northern California. I don't think any part of the country has really done especially well with COVID. Every state has grappled with this. And so, I wouldn't be trying to make, you know, comparisons between different states in terms of how they've approached this. Every state has had to approach it differently, because they've all had different challenges. Some states are far more dense, like California, than other states. Florida too is dense and I think that's why they're experiencing a very difficult epidemic right now. So, Florida is not out of the woods by a long shot. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. Canada is now saying that it has detected evidence of that new strain of coronavirus on its shores. That means it's here in North America. The U.S. is set to begin requiring those coming from the United Kingdom where this is thought to have originated, and people will have to be tested within seventy-two hours of arrival. Is that going to make any impact? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think it's probably here in the United States, and-- and it could be here in a reasonable number at this point. Where-- we don't sequence a lot of samples in this country. And a lot of that sequencing that does get done, gets done in private labs, and doesn't get aggregated into public database-- that needs-- databases. That needs to be fixed. In the U.K., they're sequencing about ten percent of all the samples. Here we're doing a fraction of one percent. I'm on the board of Illumina, one of the companies that's involved in sequencing. We probably need a better approach to more systematically sequenced strains in the United States to track changes and new variants in this virus. We're not doing that. And so we probably wouldn't be detecting it if it was here in sort of low numbers, which I suspect it is. MARGARET BRENNAN: So it may be here, we just don't know it. On the vaccine, nine and a half million doses of the two approved vaccines have been distributed. As of the week past the CDC says a bit more than a million vaccinations have actually taken place. What do you think of this pace? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, the pace is slower than what was stated. I think it's probably realistic to think that the pace is going to be a little bit slower, especially as we try to move through hard to vaccinate populations next month. I suspect there's more than a million who have been vaccinated. There's a lag in reporting. But the idea that we're going to get to twenty million vaccines-- vaccinations by the end of the year, that's probably unrealistic at this point. And, remember, that's after they cut in half. They only shipped about forty-five percent of the vaccines to states. So the states weren't able to absorb this. Now, I think-- I think they'll get up and running and get better systems in place to distribute these vaccines more efficiently. I think they're going to turn to CVS and Walgreens to start distributing them in the community, and that's a pretty big footprint. But, again, as you get out into the community, try to vaccinate a harder to reach population, it's going to come-- become significantly more difficult to get those vaccines out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And so the fact that we've struggled to vaccinate health care workers and nursing home patients, that shows we need to be investing more in these efforts. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good point. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you as always for your analysis. And before you go I do want to--- SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot. MARGARET BRENNAN: --thank you. The whole team wants to thank you for helping to guide our viewers and us through this crisis. And we want to thank your wife and your family for sacrificing your Sunday mornings so that you can join us here. We'll see you next year. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks for the opportunity. Thank you. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress will be back in session tomorrow to try to resolve its standoff with President Trump. As of this morning, he is refusing to sign the COVID relief bill, and if he doesn't sign it or if he vetoes it, the impact to tens of millions of Americans and the U.S. economy could be enormous. Jobless benefits for more than fourteen million people stopped yesterday. The three-hundred-dollar a week payment was supposed to be extended until mid-March. Without the bill's extension, the federal moratorium on housing evictions will end on Thursday, impacting as many as thirty million Americans. The President insists that he wants to boost individual payments from six hundred dollars to two thousand for Americans who make less than seventy-five thousand dollars a year. But that is a figure that most Republicans think is just too high. Most urgently, the bill funds the government, and without another temporary funding measure, it could shut down at midnight tomorrow. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: You can go to our website at facethenation.com for more of what didn't make it to air today. Our full book panel is available on our YouTube channel and a version of that (AUDIO CUT). (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Today, we wanted to bring together two governors from particularly hard hit states this year, Ohio Republican Mike DeWine and Michigan Democrat Gretchen Whitmer. Good morning to both of you, Governors. GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-Michigan/@GovWhitmer): Good morning. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE (R-Ohio/@GovMikeDeWine): Good to be with you. Thank you very much, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the responsibility of dealing with this pandemic, including the decisions on health restrictions, on testing, how you're going to get this vaccine to your constituents has really been placed on you as the executives in your state. Do you feel like the country learned this year the value of their local government, Governor Whitmer? GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: Well, I hope so. I know that this is not a moment that any one of us governors would have chosen to be in, and yet it was incumbent on us to rise to this challenge and to do what we needed to do to protect the people that we serve. In lieu of a broader national strategy, it really was on us to navigate. And I think we've done-- done a lot of it together. MARGARET BRENNAN: And Governor DeWine, do-- do you think there is a new appreciation for the local officials versus the focus on the national? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: No, I think people normally look to their governors in a-- in a crisis, a local crisis, you know, flooding along the Ohio River or tornadoes in western Ohio. That's normally what you think a governor will respond to. So I think in a sense, they're-- they're used to, you know, a crisis. But, of course, this is a once in a hundred years. We haven't seen anything like this at all. And I think one of the things that I have found good about it, frankly, is that I've gotten to know Gretchen, Governor Whitmer. I've gotten to know all our neighboring governors. And, you know, we talk-- we talk quite a bit. And, frankly, you know, we have a common enemy. The common enemy is this virus. And we're, you know, we're-- we're battling back against it. You know, there are certainly some people in my state who, you know, disagree with some of the things that-- that we have done. MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Whitmer, I mean, viruses don't know borders. Do you feel like as, you know, two Midwesterners here, that there is more of a call now to work together regionally to deal with crises like this pandemic? I mean are you looking at that when it comes, for instance, on how to vaccinate your populations? GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: This virus does not stop at state line. It doesn't stop at party line. This is a common enemy. And that's always been how we've looked at it, trying to learn from the best science. This being a novel virus, we've learned an incredible amount. But when I share information with Governor DeWine and vice versa, I get the benefit of the Cleveland Clinic and all the experts he's talking to and he gets the benefit of the University of Michigan and all the experts we're talking to. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you coordinate those strategies on who goes first and who goes last? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: Well, you know, we share a lot of information. And we were on the phone with all the Midwestern governors just a few days ago, and one of the issues, of course, is, you know, what's-- what's the priority? I think there's been a real consensus among what we call A1 group, which is the-- the first responders, our medical people, our EMS, people who are risking their lives every-- every single day, as well as where we've taken the most losses, and that is in our nursing homes. I think there's probably going to be more lack of consensus among people in general when you get beyond that first group. MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Whitmer, I wonder how you're thinking of it, because like we're talking about essential worker is, you know, kind of subjective here. In-- in the state of Colorado, I read they are going to begin prioritizing employees at ski resorts, for example, because it's so key to their economy. I mean how much is this going to vary state by state? Who's essential in Michigan? GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: I've-- I think it could vary a great deal. And the thing is, vaccines are coming online and they're going to come at a faster pace. And so doing the hard work of acknowledging who is-- has the most exposure, who is out there in jobs that are, you know, come into contact with the public at greater numbers. These vaccines, what we have to do right now is really to ensure that the public understands these are safe, these are effective. As they become more available, we want people to make their plan to get vaccinated. MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Whitmer and Governor DeWine, both of you have been, you know, criticized for taking extraordinary measures to protect your constituents, but been accused of, you know, overstepping authority, for example. Governor Whitmer, I know you had that extraordinary kidnapping threat. There were threats against you, Governor DeWine, as well. I-- I wonder how the both of you make sense of that experience, Governor Whitmer? GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: Well, Margaret, I would say this: Every governor in the country is getting some sort of, you know, backlash. The backlash that we're getting is because we've gone to take sure that every measure is about saving people's lives. And we have largely had a lot of success. Studies have shown we have saved thousands of lives, and, yet, we know COVID-19 is still a very real threat. We're posting the highest numbers that we have in ten months. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: Mm-Hm. GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: Other governors are getting a backlash because they haven't done enough and people have been dying on their watch. There are no easy solutions here, no clearly obvious solutions here. Yet, I believe that the right thing to do is to follow the science and to put people's lives first because we can and we will recover from the economic blowback, from COVID-19 that has run amuck in our country. What we can't do is, you know, bring someone back to life. MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor DeWine? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: Well, I think it's understandable that people are upset. It's nine months into this. People are tired of it, so I-- I get it. And, you know, we've asked people to-- to make sacrifices. But my message to the people of Ohio continues to be, we should do everything we can to save lives and hope is there. The vaccine is here. Now it's going to take a few months, you know, for everybody to-- to-- to get it, but this is not the time to pull back. This is not the time to give up. We know bu-- business, particularly small business, continuing to go is very, very important. We know they've been hit very, very hard.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: But you've got to balance that with-- with saving the lives. MARGARET BRENNAN: Here's to a healthier and happier 2021. Thanks to you both, Governors. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We like to honor tradition on FACE THE NATION, and each year we talk to authors whose new books have all been named some of the year's best. Four of them join us now. Jon Meacham's new book is His Truth Is Marching On: John Lewis and the Power of Hope. Peter Baker and Susan Glasser are the co-authors of The Man Who Ran Washington: The Life and Times of James A. Baker III. And Isabel Wilkerson is with us to discuss her latest Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents. Good to see all of you. Isabel, I want to start with you. You tackle the very difficult subject of race in your book and which you describe a caste system in our country where you say skin color is really kind of the metric for where you fall in the hierarchy. Does the awakening within our country this year to the issue of systemic racism begin breaking that apart? ISABEL WILKERSON (Caste/@Isabelwilkerson): Despite the record turnout for this election, we have seen the-- you know, the ruptures that are as deep as they've ever been. We still face, you know, disturbing levels of division in our country. This idea of racialized polarization still continues. But I do hope that some of the things that have happened over the last year, this past summer, particularly involving this sense of awakening and-- and outrage over what happened to George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and so, so many people who have become part of our conversation. I hope that this has been leading us to some type of awakening to get past these divisions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jon, you profiled one of the giants of our civil rights struggle in this country, John Lewis, who we lost this year. And you wrote about his famous march to Selma, where he was severely beaten by law enforcement, even though this started out as a peaceful protest. You said when that footage was shown to the country, there was revulsion all over America. \"Revulsion, then redemption. Is there anything more American?\" Right now in America, we have rev-- revulsion that Isabel just described again at what happened. Are we at the point of redemption yet? JON MEACHAM (His Truth Is Marching On/@jmeacham): Well, redemption is a complicated thing, and that's something that we have to work on every day. John Lewis represents, I think, faith in two fundamental forces in life. He was on that bridge because of a faith in God, and he was on that bridge because ultimately of a faith in America. Frederick Douglass once said, \"There is no soil so conducive to the growth of reform as American soil.\" And so there is-- pro-- progress is possible. And John used to say when people would say, well, nothing's ever changed. He would say, when he was a senior member of Congress, come walk in my shoes. Now, that's easy for me to say. I'm a white Southern male Episcopalian. Things tend to work out for me in this country. I wrote this book and I wanted to profile John Lewis because he represents the embodiment of the best that the religious impulse can play in our public life. And more than any other person I've ever known he closed the gap between a profession of allegiance to the lessons of the Sermon on the Mount with the practice of those virtues. And I think if we look at stories of people who walk among us and who just walked among us and we see what they did and they did something so remarkable that should give us some faith, some inspiration that we can do the same. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. And-- and part of that process, Peter and Susan, is figuring out how to turn what the country is experiencing into action that falls upon our political leaders. I mean, you-- you cover Washington, the both of you. We're seeing a lot of pressure on the President-elect to do something about race and division in this country. A lot of that early on is focused on representation. Does it end there? How does the President elect begin dealing with this problem, Peter? PETER BAKER (The New York Times/The Man Who Ran Washington/@peterbakernyt): Well, look, you know, it's not just a question of who you put in your cabinet. That's only a start. There's, obviously, great wounds out there in this country to heal. And this is a President who has talked about doing that. He's talked about being a bridge builder and talked about being a healer and a person who wants to bring America together. You know, we talk about-- in our book, we talk about James Baker not so much as a race healer but as a bridge builder. We talk about how he tried to work with the other party to make things happen. He tried to work with people from other countries and across the Cold War divide with the Soviets to bring the world together. And I think that what Joe Biden is talking about doing is the same kind of thing where we can cross these-- these lines and cross these divides and begin to reimagine America in a better way. MARGARET BRENNAN: Susan, it just feels so different. The divides feel more bitter and deep. How do you do that? And is there something unique to the challenge ahead? SUSAN GLASSER (The New Yorker/The Man Who Ran Washington/@sbg1): You know, Margaret, I think the thing that was so striking is just how profoundly the political incentives in the country have changed. It's not just that we've had a uniquely divisive President. You know, we're often used to Presidents more like Joe Biden, who at least talk and pay lip service to wanting to be a uniter, not a divider. So we certainly had a divisive President, but it's also that we've had a country and a political system that-- that's just lost the ability, it seems, for politicians to work together across the aisle. You know, the question is, have that-- has that incentive structure changed so fundamentally that it's actually going to be impossible for even a Joe Biden to come in and sit down and work when the-- the incentives and the-- the reward system has gone in the other direction to be ever more extreme. MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and, Isabel, you in your book start off with a pretty stark image of choice and-- and the moment in time. You describe a photo from 1936 in Germany in which a lone man stands in a crowd full of other men. They're all giving Nazi salutes and his hands are-- are folded. It appears defiant almost. Why did you start on this? What does that signify to you? ISABEL WILKERSON: Well, I started with that-- it's the photo of August Landmesser. He was surrounded by people who were caught under the spell of the Nazis. And, yet, he alone was the one who was on the right side of history. And we all would like to believe that we would be on the right side of history in a situation such as that that we'd somehow find a way to stand up in favor of justice in this-- in-- while we are surrounded by injustice and people who are falling under the spell of that. And so it calls upon all of us to recognize, you know, where we happen to be, what each of us can do, the responsibilities that each of us has. And the reason why I speak about hierarchy in Caste is because this is part of our inheritance, an inheritance of-- of this hierarchy that-- that dates back to the time of enslavement that has been-- that, essentially, was in place for far longer than it was not in place in our country from Jim Crow, which only ended in the 1960s, and how we live with the aftereffects of that. And it falls upon each of us to learn the history and to-- to be able to reckon with it. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm interested in this idea, though, of what you are describing as a caste system, because in-- in at least political narrative, the past four years have been about disruption. They've been about breaking apart systems. They've been about, you know, trying to break apart the establishment in particular. But you have a very different view, right? You-- you think and have pointed to the 2016 election in particular as about reinforcing those caste systems. ISABEL WILKERSON: Well, you know, a caste system, essentially, is an artificial, arbitrary, graded ranking of human value, and it dates back to the time of enslavement. And so we've inherited the assumptions, the stereotypes, the rankings that are-- have been-- have essentially been assigned to people based upon what they look like, which goes back to the time of enslavement. And I-- I want to take a moment to remind ourselves of how long this has been a part of our country, that it's the foundation of the power structure that we have inherited. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Jon, you-- you have used the phrase \"the soul of America,\" one we hear that-- that phrase from the President-elect quite often. We've had the election that was supposed to be the fight for the soul of America, where are we now? Where does that fight go? Are-- are we at absolution? Where-- where are we? JON MEACHAM: No, we're-- we're a long way from absolution and-- and will be until what Faulkner called the last red and dying evening.\u00a0My sense of the soul of the country is that the soul is not wholly good or wholly bad, but is an arena of contention in which our better angels, to use Lincoln's phrase, do battle against our worst instincts. Many of the worst instincts that Isabel's remarkable work has- has cast light on. \u00a0Many of the worst instincts that Isabel's remarkable work has-- has cast light on. And every day is part of that struggle. To go to what Peter and Susan were saying, division in American life is-- is not the exception, it's the rule. And disagreement and the impulses of appetite and ambition and the clash of interests, all of these things are perennial and universal human forces. What we have to do, what we're called to do by history and by reason and to some extent by faith, is to devote ourselves to the idea and the reality of making real for everybody the promise of the country-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JON MEACHAM: --which is that we were all created equal and we're endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. And at every point, Isabel mentioned the right side of history, at every point from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, the right side of history has been those who stand on the side of individual rights, of the sanctity of the individual, of liberty under law and of openness, not of-- you know, we build bridges in this country when we're at our best, not walls. And that may sound like a homily, but it has the virtue of being rooted in history. Go around Washington. What are the monuments to? The monuments are to imperfect people and imperfect events, but they are ultimately about liberation and not captivity. And that's what our-- the work of politics should be. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, President Trump as we-- as I referenced, was elected on this agenda of disrupting the status quo. Kamala Harris is a symbol of change. Joe Biden, though, is seen as a return of the establishment. What is the choice we are making here as-- as a country? I mean in-- in some ways, the Biden platform was about restoring where-- where we were. SUSAN GLASSER: Well, look, Margaret, it's very hard to imagine a world where we're just going to pretend that the last four years didn't happen, right? You know, I think there was a-- a palpable sense of returning to normalcy that-- that powered and animated Joe Biden's campaign. But I think, you know, the question is really whether identity politics is the choice that people on both sides of the aisle are making right now. Was it really about a policy platform for Biden or even for Donald Trump? You know, to me, the lesson of the last few years is that people are much more likely to embrace identities and tribalism that they find to be comfortable in our politics right now at the expense even of a program. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the disruption become the new foundation here or is it about restoration? SUSAN GLASSER: Margaret, that, to me, that's the thing that's so notable. You might want a more normal world, right? That word normalcy, you know, has never had such political resonance. But the truth is, is that, you know, the world has moved on. And there are a number of areas, the Middle East and the recognition of Israel sort of midwifed by the Trump administration, by several Arab countries, obviously is-- is a different faction and a different reality than the one that was there four years ago. Biden so far has assembled a government that suggests that-- that a sort of certainly a return to competence and expertise, bringing people who served already in senior positions in the Obama administration. So, there's a continuity. And then I think the-- the message to people is that Trump represents a discontinuity-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SUSAN GLASSER: --in American politics and policy. But I-- it's-- it's unclear that that's really the case. And I think, you know, to Jon's point, we're not just going to wash away the last few years. That's not how this is going to work. It's not over. It's not even the beginning of over. We're not just going to wake up one day and it's all going to be some-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SUSAN GLASSER: --crazy dream and, you know, tweet storms. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Peter, you know, as Americans, we always think it's about us and we're talking here about us as a country. But for the rest of the world, when-- when they hear the President-elect say America is back and we're ready to lead. Hasn't the world moved on? Hasn't the world changed? Does the world really want America to organize it? PETER BAKER: Yeah, that's a great question, and I think President-elect Biden probably recognizes that it's not simply a matter of returning to where things were four years ago. And if he doesn't, that's going to be a challenge for him, because, in fact you're right, the world has moved on to some extent. They've seen in the last four years, what it's like when America goes in a different direction. I think there's a lot of burned feelings out there about international agreements. What-- you know, who's going to want to enter a new international agreement with the United States, if they feel like four years from now, it might just be reversed by the next administration? And that's why I think President-elect Biden does have a-- a challenge in terms of deciding what to keep and what not to keep of what his predecessor has done, partly because of this-- the idea of not seeming like we just swing back and forth radically every-- every term. He probably will adopt more of-- of Trump's positions on China, for instance, maybe not the specific tactics on tack-- on tariffs, but a stronger position against China than the Obama administration had. You can't just simply rerun the past. You're going to have to adapt to the future. And that will include at least some of what the last four years has-- has-- has brought to us. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks to all of you for the conversation and for joining us today. And happy New Year. Stay healthy. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's it for us for 2020. We hope you have a happy and healthy and safe New Year. We will see you next Sunday in 2021.

            "article_content": "Even after the acquittal of the president, his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is pursuing allegations of corruption in Ukraine. This past week, Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department would \"carefully scrutinize\" what Giuliani finds. Last July, President Trump made the phone call to Ukraine that led to impeachment. He asked the president of Ukraine to investigate a mysterious Democratic National Committee computer server that Mr. Trump said was hidden in Ukraine. We have found that odd request is a story that has grown over the years and was influenced by Moscow. You may have wondered how the president was impeached over Ukraine of all places. The answer is in the story of the mystery server, a reminder that the U.S. and Russia have been on opposite sides of a war in Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2014. Few people understand what's at stake as well as Ambassador Bill Taylor. He led the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine as the Trump administration withheld military aid while pressing for investigations of Democrats. Taylor's testimony carried the weight of his resume; Westpoint, 101st Airborne in Vietnam, 33 years as a diplomat, and an expert on Ukraine. \"Ukraine's security is important to our security and the reason I believe that is that Ukraine is on the frontline,\" Taylor told correspondent Scott Pelley. \"The Russians are fighting a hybrid war against Ukraine, but it's not just about Ukraine, they are fighting a hybrid war against Europe and against the United States.\" \"The war that the Russians are fighting in Ukraine,\" Pelley said to Taylor, \"We have a stake in?\" \"We have a stake in, but it's not just the military war,\" Taylor said. \"Hybrid war is more than tanks and soldiers. Hybrid war is information war, it's cyber war, it's economic war, it's attacks on elections and as we know they have attacked our elections.\" The Russian attack on the 2016 election included hacking the computers of the Democratic National Committee. U.S. intelligence agencies found, \"\u2026the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton\u2026\" Former deputy national intelligence officer and CIA Russia analyst, Andrea Kendall-Taylor worked on that report.\u00a0 \"The report itself was based on a large body of evidence that demonstrated not only what Russia was doing, but also its intent,\" Kendall-Taylor said. \"And it's based on a number of different sources, collected human intelligence, technical intelligence.\" Kendall-Taylor said the evidence is convincing and it isn't a close call. \"If you read the intelligence report, it's the consensus view of three intelligence agencies; CIA, NSA and the FBI,\" Kendall-Taylor said. The same conclusion was reached by the Republican-led Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The committee's report on Russia interference was unanimously approved by all of its Democratic and Republican members. Democrat Mark Warner is vice-chairman. \"The Russian project was a top down, government-run covert operation that hacked into the DNC and individuals' personal emails, and weaponized that information to release it at the most important times,\" Warner said. But the idea that the Trump campaign was helped by Russia, even unwittingly, was a unanimous judgment Mr. Trump would not accept. \"And by the way folks just in case you're like, curious, no, Russia did not help me OK? Russia? I call it the Russian Hoax,\" Mr. Trump said at a rally in Alabama in 2017. Mr. Trump began a campaign to discredit the intelligence community's conclusions. He tweeted, \"So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers?\" In Mr. Trump's telling, the FBI failed to look for evidence on the Democrats' computer network. The story of the mystery server was born. So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on? Robert Johnston dealt directly with the FBI as an investigator of the DNC hack for CrowdStrike, a leading cyber security company hired by the Democrats. He told us the FBI didn't physically examine the DNC servers because CrowdStrike gave the bureau copies of the data from the servers.\u00a0 \"If there is a server or a computer system of any kind that's involved in the incident you can take an exact bit for bit digital copy of what's on that system. Now that digital copy is just as good as having the real thing,\" Johnston said. \"As far as you know, the FBI got what it needed and what it wanted?\" Pelley asked Johnston. \"Exactly and evidence of that is you don't hear the FBI complaining,\" Johnston said. He's right. A former senior government official, familiar with the investigation, told us the FBI would have preferred to work alongside CrowdStrike's investigators, but the Democratic National Committee decided to give the bureau digital copies of its servers instead. The official told us this was \"acceptable,\" in fact even typical in FBI investigations. ...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election! Disproven and paid for by Democrats \u201cDossier used to spy on Trump Campaign. Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election?\u201d @foxandfriends  Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails?  What a mess! The FBI used the data to help indict 12 Russian intelligence agents for hacking the DNC. But Mr. Trump's tweets persisted, \"Why did the DNC refuse to turn over its server to the FBI\u2026\" and \"Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers?\" There were more than 140 servers in the Democrats' network, but Mr Trump created an image of a single box of incriminating information. \"Where is the server? I want to know, where is the server? And what is the server saying? With that being said, all I can do is ask the question,\" Mr Trump said in a press conference while standing alongside President Putin. \"My people came to me \u2014 Dan Coats came to me and some others \u2014 they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server.\" That statement, letting Russia off the hook, forced President Trump to issue a retraction the next day. Through all of this, Vladimir Putin wasn't just standing idly by. He was working to shift blame away from Russia. \"What we can see is that Russia did what Russia does, and that is piling on,\" Kendall-Taylor said. \"They amplify those narratives in ways that then advance Russia's own interests.\" \"They look for conspiracy theories that are already out there?\" Pelley asked. \"They're picking up on elements or narratives that already exist in a society and amplifying those narratives that advance Russian interests,\" Kendall-Taylor said. The interest of Putin was to drive a wedge between his enemy, Ukraine and Ukraine's most important ally, the United States.\u00a0 \"A successful, prosperous, Western-oriented Ukraine provides a direct threat to Putin's hold on power,\" Kendall-Taylor said. \"He can't have a successful Ukraine on his southern border, because then it demonstrates to Russians what is possible.\" Two weeks after Mr. Trump's inauguration, Putin said, in a news conference, it was not Russia that helped Donald Trump but Ukraine that helped Hillary Clinton. Russian media and U.S. conspiracy websites began to spin suspicion of Ukraine. Ultimately, those rumors appealed to Mr. Trump's private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was working to discredit the investigations of Russian meddling in 2016. \"And there were concerns that there was another game being played, another channel that Mr. Giuliani was involved in,\" Bill Taylor said. As head of the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, Taylor was frustrated that Giuliani was agitating for investigations that were never official U.S. policy. Taylor said no one at the State Department ever directed him to investigate whether there was a server in Ukraine because, \"no one took it seriously.\" No one, perhaps, except the president. In 2017, for the first time, he added Ukraine to the story of the server. In an interview he said, \"Why wouldn't \u2026 Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server? They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.\" \"CrowdStrike?\" The reporter asked. \"That's what I heard,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian...\" The Securities and Exchange Commission, shows that CrowdStrike is incorporated in Delaware and based in California. Its largest shareholders are American venture capital firms. Over the years, CrowdStrike has been hired by both the Democratic and Republican parties. \"So, the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine,\" Mr. Trump said during remarks at the White House in October 2019. \"I'd like to see the server.\" Taylor said that, to his knowledge, there are no links between CrowdStrike and anyone in Ukraine. \"Was this something that the embassy was concerned about?\" Pelley asked. \"No,\" Taylor said. Pelley asked Johnston if, during the investigation he was leading, CrowdStrike ever sent any of the DNC's computer hardware to Ukraine. \"No,\" Johnston said. \"That-- that is-- that is insane. That is not within the realm of reality.\" Last July, reality suffered a final blow. The story Mr. Trump first adopted as a server the FBI was blocked from seeing, and then became the server investigated by a Ukrainian company, finally morphed into the server hidden in Ukraine. In the call, after the Ukrainian president asked for anti-tank missiles to defend himself from Russia, Mr. Trump replied, \"I would like you to do us a favor though\u2026 they say CrowdStrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it.\" This was the first favor Mr. Trump asked for even before his request that Ukraine also investigate the son of Vice President Biden. This past November, Mr. Trump spoke, by phone, to \"Fox and Friends.\"\u00a0\"They gave the server to CrowdStrike or whatever it's called which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian and I still want to see that server you know the FBI's never gotten that server,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That's a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company, why?\"\u00a0\"Are you sure they did that?\" an anchor on the show asked the president. \"Are you sure they gave it to Ukraine?\"\u00a0Mr. Trump replied, \"Well, that's what the word is\u2026\" \"The word,\" that Ukraine was involved, was amplified by the president's defenders in the impeachment inquiry. They pointed to a 2016 opinion article and social media posts, written by Ukrainians, that were critical of Mr. Trump, as though they were equivalent to Russia's covert campaign targeting U.S. computer networks, voting systems and social media. Fiona Hill, Mr. Trump's former senior director for Russia on the National Security Council, warned the committee.\u00a0 \"Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country\u2014and that, perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,\" Hill said. \"This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.\" \"What are the chances that this whispering campaign about a Democratic National Committee server in Ukraine is actually a Russian intelligence operation, a Russian disinformation operation?\" Pelley asked Taylor. \"The Russians are very good at that,\" Taylor said. \"It's these fake stories that they have propagated. And that's what they do. They do it pretty well. We have to be on guard against that.\" From Vladimir Putin's perspective it worked. Last November, as impeachment played out and America's next election season was underway, he said, at a forum, \"Thank God no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore; now they're accusing Ukraine.\" We reached out to the White House multiple times on this story, but they did not respond.

            "article_content": "WELCOME TO 2020. CBS NEWS' TRAIL MARKERS IS BACK. HERE'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED:\u00a0Former New York City Mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg is embracing a straight-talking, New York style on the campaign trail, which could appeal to voters looking for authenticity,\u00a0CBS News political director Caitlin Conant\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0report. A similarly blunt style was something that worked well for President Trump, another New Yorker, in 2016. When answering a question in Fayetteville, North Carolina about whether the United States should reinstate the draft one day after the killing of the Iranian military official Qasem Soleimani, Bloomberg said that Americans weren't in good enough shape to fight. \"If I talk to the generals, 25 percent of all the people that come in physically can't do it,\" Bloomberg said in Fayetteville, the home of Fort Bragg. \"Americans are getting soft and we're overweight, and we don't exercise and don't get good education, which you need to join the military in this day and age.\" Bloomberg has also dismissed attacks from fellow Democrats regarding his personal fortune, which CBS News estimates is north of $50 billion. \"They're criticizing me for it. I don't know, ask them what they're doing. Why didn't they do that? They had a chance to go out and make a lot of money. And how much of their own money do they put into their campaigns?\" Bloomberg recently told \"CBS This Morning\" co- host Gayle King. Rather than shying away from it, Bloomberg leans into his billionaire status. A frequent refrain in his stump speech is that the massive donations he made in 2018 House races were pivotal in Democrats regaining control in the House. His campaign contributions, he said at an event in San Diego on Sunday, put \"Nancy Pelosi in charge, and she has started to hold [Mr. Trump] accountable in the impeachment process. So it really made a difference.\" The day after the House impeachment vote, Bloomberg held an event in Nashville. While the other candidates were duking it out on the debate stage in Los Angeles, Bloomberg was taking credit for the impeachment vote, saying it wouldn't have been possible without his financial involvement in the 2018 midterm elections. At this same event, when protesters criticized Bloomberg for what they saw as his more moderate stances, he was quick to fire back. \"I'm doing more on the climate than you've even dreamed of. I've put a fortune into this thing, and we're still doing it,\" Bloomberg retorted. Members of Bloomberg's own campaign have not been spared from his sharp tongue. At an event in Alexandria, Virginia, Bloomberg criticized his staff after they led him outside for a photo op in front of a closed-down coal factory.\u00a0 \"This is one of the dumbest things we've ever done,\" Bloomberg said. You won't find the blunt-speaking Bloomberg in his campaign TV ads, which are currently saturating the airwaves in much of the country. But with a news cycle focused on impeachment, Iran, and the early-state contests he's skipping, will Bloomberg's straight talk help him break through the noise? With the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll showing close contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bloomberg is hoping that he can convince voters in March's Super Tuesday states that he's the only candidate tough enough to defeat Mr. Trump. JOE BIDEN CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports\u00a0that with less than a month before the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden is continuing to overwhelmingly target rural communities throughout the state. In fact, the last event he held in Des Moines before his current bus tour was in November, when former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack and wife Christie Vilsack, endorsed him. On Monday, he wrapped his fourth bus tour in the state. \"We feel good about where this Iowa operation is and we feel good about where we are one month out,\" Biden campaign senior adviser Anita Dunn told\u00a0Erickson, adding it's a \"mistake\" for campaigns to focus only on \"larger population areas.\" But the Biden campaign will be relying on ads to bring his message home in those areas, with $4 million in television and digital ads throughout the Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Quad Cities and Sioux City areas.\u00a0 His campaign recently reportedly canceled ad spending in South Carolina between now and January 27, where he has been leading in recent polls. Campaign aides tell CBS News the strongest pockets of Biden's support in the state are in eastern Iowa, specifically the towns of Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Waterloo and Clinton.\u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN Mere days after dropping out of the race himself, Julian Castro endorsed Elizabeth Warren for president, reports\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak.\u00a0 \"There's one candidate I see who is unafraid to fight like hell to make sure that America's promise will be there for everyone,\" Castro said in a video posted on Twitter that announced the endorsement. \u00a0 Although Castro's campaign never found momentum, it was praised by the left wing of the Democratic party. In a field with dwindling diversity, he was also the only Latino candidate. But a Warren-Castro affiliation had been long anticipated. The two have tended to move in the same lane, both literally, when Castro stepped into Warren's photo line for a picture with the senator at Iowa's Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, and in policy, when Warren followed Castro in calling for the decriminalization of unlawful border crossings in July.\u00a0 Castro, who was considered a potential vice presidential pick long before he left the race, could prove a valuable surrogate for Warren in January, especially if she's held up in Washington for President Trump's impeachment trial. However, with less than a month until the Iowa caucus, potential supporters may remember that Castro spent much of November arguing that Iowa and New Hampshire should not be first-in-the-nation states. MIKE BLOOMBERG The verdict is in. Judy Sheindlin, best known as Judge Judy, is officially endorsing former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg for president and has released an advertisement for his campaign, CBS News' Melissa Quinn wrote Monday. The endorsement marks Sheindlin's first of a presidential candidate and comes after the famed judge of daytime television announced her support for Bloomberg in October, before he launched his campaign for president and after he vowed to sit out the race. \"I like to say you can judge someone's character by what they've done. Mike Bloomberg has done amazing things and will be a truly great president,\" Sheindlin says in the 30-second ad. \"No one comes close to Mike Bloomberg's executive achievement, government experience and impactful philanthropy. His steady leadership will unite our country and bring us through these very challenging times.\" Sheindlin, 77, served as the supervising judge of Manhattan Family Court before launching a television career with the Emmy-award winning show \"Judge Judy,\" which debuted in 1996. A\u00a02016 survey\u00a0found that 10% of college graduates believe Sheindlin is on the U.S. Supreme Court. NEW HAMPSHIRE In New Hampshire's first county-wide endorsement, Carroll County Chair Knute Ogren announced his support for Pete Buttigieg Monday, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"As a person of faith, I appreciate how Pete speaks intelligently and authentically about faith in a way that drives all of us, regardless of our personal faith or lack of faith, to rebuild our community \u2014 a rare thing in today's politics,\" Ogren said in a statement. \"With our nation so divided, he inspires us to serve and to be compassionate to one another \u2014 something our country desperately needs. And as a mayor and a veteran, he has embodied a humble life of service, and we can all learn from his example.\" Carroll County, a largely rural home to just a sliver of New Hampshire's Democrats, voted for Donald Trump by a slender margin in 2016, with 50.3% casting their ballot for the President. Primary voters backed Sanders with 63%, picking the Vermont lawmaker over Secretary Hillary Clinton who won over just 36% of Carroll County.\u00a0 The county has experienced a shift in politics in recent years. While in 2016, Republicans occupied 12 of Carroll County's 15 seats, the GOP lost five of those seats to Democrats during the 2018 midterm elections.\u00a0 NEVADA One of Joe Biden's earliest endorsers in Nevada is stepping up to a new role for his campaign: Nevada State Senator Yvanna Cancela, who once served as political director for the influential Culinary Union, was named a Nevada senior adviser on Monday, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Though the legislature isn't scheduled to reconvene for another year, Cancela cited her Southern Nevada constituents in explaining the move. \"They deserve better than Donald Trump and his attacks on immigrants, health care, and the environment \u2014 we all do. That is precisely why I'm on Team Joe: we must all do our part to defeat Donald Trump and I know by helping Joe win in February, we will be one step closer to making that a reality,\" she said in a statement released by the campaign Also in Nevada, Tin\u00a0reports that with less than two months until voting begins in Nevada's presidential contest, the state Democratic party has released\u00a0the final list of thirteen candidates\u00a0who have successfully filed for its caucus. Missing from Nevada's menu of candidates is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Even as competitors are\u00a0ramping up staff, rolling out\u00a0new endorsements, and\u00a0buying air time\u00a0in the \"first in the West\" caucus, Bloomberg's campaign\u00a0has since made clear its plans\u00a0to entirely skip the first four early states - including Nevada - and focus on Super Tuesday's\u00a0mammoth haul of delegates.\u00a0 SOUTH CAROLINA After hosting numerous town halls and roundtable discussions with half a dozen Democratic candidates this cycle, South Carolina Senator Marlon Kimpson has announced he's backing former Vice President Joe Biden for president. Kimpson told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0Monday that after months of hosting events with candidates, Biden's ability to draw diverse crowds and the steady momentum he's maintained went into his final decision. \"I took some time over the holidays to digest all the information gleaned from the town halls,\" said Kimpson. \"[Biden has] overwhelming support consistently in the African-American, which is the predominant demographic in my district.\" One of just two Democratic senators representing South Carolina's Charleston County delegation, Kimpson's support could prove helpful in garnering the support of the more than 60,000 registered\u00a0voters\u00a0in his majority-black Senate district, which is comprised of both Charleston and Dorchester counties. Kimpson said that while some have accused him of showing favoritism even ahead of this endorsement, he just thought it was important that run-up to the primary contests was fair and said he thought some of the early criticisms that Biden received were unfair. In July, Kimpson was one of several African American leaders who met with Biden ahead of Representative Jim Clyburn's \"World Famous Fish Fry,\" just days after he received criticism from Democratic rivals for comments about his ability to work with known segregationists.\u00a0 Kimpson spoke with reporters after the meeting, which was closed to the press, and CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0at the time that the popular state senator said the former vice president's history showed that he's been a champion for civil rights. He said ultimately, he decided to endorse now because he felt it was time to take a more active role in the process. \"I took the job of vetting the candidates and requesting that the candidates engage with the citizens in my district very seriously and I kept an open mind pretty much throughout the whole process,\" Kimpson told CBS. \"I just felt a need to get off the sidelines and make sure that I get involved in helping influence the election.\" FOREIGN POLICY REACTIONS TO SOLEIMANI STRIKE: CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News associate producer Ben Mitchell\u00a0report that the Democratic candidates over the weekend and on Monday expressed concern over the long-term consequences of the U.S. strike killing Iranian Military Leader Qasem Soleimani. Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg both said there should be no weeping for Soleimani, but the United States needs to know if President Trump has a plan. Buttigieg initially called the strike an \"assassination\" as Warren and Bernie Sanders have done, but he walked that back in an interview on CNN Sunday, saying \"I'm not interested in the terminology.\" Former Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman\u00a0penned an op-ed\u00a0in the Wall Street Journal Sunday night criticizing the Democratic candidates \"yes, but..\" approach, saying that it is reasonable to ask questions about the decision but Trump should receive credit for taking out a guy like Soleimani. EARLY CONTEST BUYS: CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0reports that Democratic presidential candidates are upping their TV and radio ad buys ahead of the first contests in the 2020 presidential primary race next month. According to Kantar Media tracking, Elizabeth Warren is leading the pack in regards to planned ad buys in early states with nearly $7 million in future reservations including more than $2.5 million in Iowa, more than $1.5 million in each New Hampshire and South Carolina and more than $1 million in Nevada. \u00a0 At the same time, Joe Biden has $3.8 million in TV ad buys planned with nearly $1.5 million in Iowa, more than $1.1 million in South Carolina, more than $830,000 in Nevada and $300,000 in New Hampshire. Bernie Sanders also has more than $3 million in ad reservations planned including nearly $2.5 million in Iowa, while Tom Steyer has more than $2.2 million in ad reservations in the early states with less than $1 million in each. Pete Buttigieg has nearly $600,000 in reservations in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Meanwhile, Mike Bloomberg has them all beat in terms of dollars with nearly $10 million in ad reservations right now, but he is not competing in early-voting states. Bloomberg's biggest reservations are currently in California, Texas and Florida, with more than $1 million in each state. He also has more than half a million dollars in reservations in New York and Pennsylvania. These expected buys come after candidates broke presidential race ad buy records in 2019, with billionaires paving the way. After jumping in the race, Mike Bloomberg spent more than $135 million on TV ads through December 31 of last year. Tom Steyer was right behind with $113 million on TV and radio ads in 2019.\u00a0 Other candidates didn't even come close. Bernie Sanders spent more than $10.5 million, Pete Buttigieg spent nearly $10 million, Andrew Yang spent $6.5 million, Elizabeth Warren spent $3 million, Joe Biden spent more than $2.5 million and Amy Klobuchar spent more than $2 million. By comparison, Donald Trump spent just over $7 million in 2019. DIGITAL:\u00a0Starting today, Google's updated policy on political advertisements goes into effect across its various platforms,\u00a0CBS News Associate Producer Ben Mitchell\u00a0reports.\u00a0 The company will ban or limit certain types of microtargeted ads that political campaigns use to reach specific voters based on information specific to a voter or certain voting groups. The change comes as social media and digital media companies grapple with how best to moderate and combat misinformation during elections.\u00a0 Google's platforms, which include YouTube as well as traditional page ads, have largely taken a backseat to Facebook in the eyes of the media, due in part to Facebook's outsized role in the spread of misinformation during the last presidential election. But Google's influence can't be ignored. One need look no further than the digital spending footprint of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has spent more than $14 million on ads hosted by Google's platforms since entering the race in November, surpassing the total President Trump has spent this entire election cycle. By comparison, Bloomberg has spent just $5.4 million on Facebook ads to date. That's in part because Bloomberg is not as focused as his peers on grassroots fundraising, something Facebook ads are exceptionally good at driving.\u00a0 But Google's changes may not make a massive difference in the long run: the company will still allow campaigns to buy ads based on gender, race and zipcode, three very potent tools when targeting ads to critical voting groups. \u00a0SENATE FUNDRAISING According to numbers released by his campaign, Representative Joe Kennedy raised around $2.4 million in the final fundraising quarter of 2019 in his U.S. Senate bid. Kennedy announced in September he would challenge incumbent Democrat Ed Markey. Markey's campaign told\u00a0CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0that the senator's reelection campaign raised over $1.4 million during the fundraising quarter, which is an increase of over 30 percent from the prior quarter.\u00a0 Topping his previous fundraising haul, South Carolina Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison, who's waging a campaign to unseat Republican incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham, announced another \"record-breaking\" quarter, raising more than $3.5 million in Q4, according to\u00a0LaCrai Mitchell.\u00a0 This total not only surpasses the $2.1 million that Harrison's team\u00a0brought in for Q3\u00a0but also exceeds the $3.29 million that Graham raised in Q3. Touting over 67,000 total individual contributors, Harrison's cash on hand total of $4.6 million is just over half of what Graham had in the bank at the conclusion of Q3. Mitchell reports that in a press release Monday, Harrison said he's running to be the change that he says South Carolina deserves. \"This campaign is about bringing hope back into the lives of the people of the Palmetto State and bringing a spirit of public service back to the Senate.\"",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, moving on to May is proving to be even more challenging as the emotional dilemma between personal and economic well-being intensifies.\u00a0With restrictions on Americans and businesses across the country easing by the day, the Trump administration says there are positive signs in the battle against the coronavirus.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The testing and the masks and all of the things, we've solved every problem. We solved it quickly.\u00a0JARED KUSHNER: We're on the other side of the medical aspect of this, and I think that we've achieved all the different milestones that are needed.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And there are some bright spots with treating the virus. The FDA gave emergency authorization for the drug remdesivir to be used intravenously for hospitalized patients after trials showed a quicker recovery. And the administration launched Operation Warp Speed, in a rush to find and manufacture a vaccine for COVID-19. But are we flattening the curve? Some experts say that with the books closed on April, we haven't seen the expected results from the stay-at-home orders, at one point in place for ninety percent of the country. With new predictions of the virus lasting for some time, perhaps as long as two years, are we moving too fast too soon? We'll talk to the governor of Illinois, J. B. Pritzker. Daniel O'Day, the head of the drug company manufacturing remdesivir, Gilead Sciences, will join us. Plus, former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Then we'll look at the grim and growing financial fallout as the number of jobless Americans jumps to more than thirty million. We'll talk with the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Raphael Bostic, and the CEO of Southwest Airlines Gary Kelly. Finally, with six months to go until Election Day, a look at campaign 2020.\u00a0All that and more, is just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Welcome to FACE THE NATION. As we turn the page to a new month Americans continue to struggle emotionally, financially, and with just trying to plan ahead. In most cases there are few clear answers to our many questions. We will continue to seek them for you. Our coverage begins today with CBS News national correspondent Mark Strassmann in Atlanta.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News National Correspondent): In America's COVID siege, exasperation can morph into rage. Weekend protesters were furious. They argued, our oxygen-starved economy needs a ventilator, reopen for business. With thirty million jobs lost, millions of people are running low on something--food, toilet paper, patience, and especially money. You'll probably notice more stores reopening this week. Thirty-eight states have already eased restrictions, six more will follow suit tomorrow and Tuesday, all emphasizing social distancing.\u00a0GOVERNOR PHIL MURPHY (D-New Jersey): If we hear minimal reports of knucklehead behavior at our parks and we see the-- the metrics we need to meet, then we know that you all have taken to heart your responsibility.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Another concern: Food shortages. Across the country, widespread COVID infections have closed twenty-two meat and poultry-processing plants. The virus has killed at least twenty workers and at least two hundred seventy-nine have been infected in Maryland.\u00a0GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN (R-Maryland): Any disruption or interruption to processing at our poultry-processing plants could lead to significant national supply chain issues.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Most health experts worry about a shortage of COVID testing. As April ended, the U.S. had conducted 6.2 million COVID tests. But a Harvard study concluded the country needs five million tests a day by early June to reopen safely. And Maryland and Colorado plan to hide their PPE from the federal government.\u00a0GOVERNOR JARED POLIS (D-Colorado): A global free-for-all. We're just worried about them cutting them off at the manufacturer during the supply chain or during customs.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: But there's no hiding a looming financial crisis for dozens of states. Record job losses have drained their unemployment trust funds. Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, and West Virginia all have enough to pay one more week's worth of benefits. Four other states have two weeks. And more than forty percent of Americans live in states with less than six weeks.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Several dozen malls around the country will reopen tomorrow. Here in Atlanta, Phipps Plaza behind me, is one of them. Georgia has led the charge nationally to reopen, but on Friday new COVID infections jumped again. The state reported a thousand new cases in twenty-four hours. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann, thanks.\u00a0China claims that the coronavirus outbreak began in an animal market in Wuhan. The U.S. intelligence community is investigating that theory and the possibility that it was accidentally released from a lab. Either way, U.S.-China relations are at a new low. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports on COVID-19 hot spots around the world.\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@elizapalmer): Margaret, China was the very first country to enforce radical isolation and widespread testing--an approach we now know to be the most effective way to control a COVID outbreak.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: And it's paid off. Almost fifteen weeks since Wuhan went into lockdown, if not for the masks, life this May Day weekend looks pretty normal. Even retail shops are open. South Korea acted fast, too, and now says it has the outbreak under control. There is still social distancing, here at an exam for job applicants. But with just a handful of new cases every day, Koreans are at last relaxing. At the other extreme, there is Brazil. These are fresh graves in Sao Paulo. The country is South America's COVID epicenter. With a rampant outbreak, limited testing, and a president, who when confronted with the numbers said, so, what do you want me to do? In Europe, rules are easing, but at different speeds. Spaniards gratefully took to the streets after forty-eight days indoors, but only to exercise. Adults in the morning; kids in the afternoon. Austria has opened up more widely. Shops and crucially even hair salons are up and running. Poland is due to reopen its borders today, but care homes are still strictly locked down, though this one in Warsaw went the extra mile to arrange safe visits. Europeans can now see the light at the end of the COVID tunnel. Even in lockdown, they are finding ways to party. This is a drive-in disco in Germany. And here is the Finnish folk group, (INDISTINCT), celebrating International Dance Day in isolation.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: Here in the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fianc\u00e9e had a new baby last week. But he is not taking any paternity leave. Instead, he is hard at work on a plan to gradually reopen things in Britain. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Elizabeth Palmer, thank you.\u00a0We go now to Chicago, Illinois, and Governor J.B. Pritzker. Last week, he extended the state's stay-at-home order until the end of May. Good morning to you, Governor.\u00a0GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois/@GovPritzker): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Why is the number of hospitalizations in your state still increasing?\u00a0GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, it's increasing barely, it's true. But we have really bent the curve significantly. We're not through this yet. There's no doubt. And we've been looking to see those numbers flatten. We are seeing them flatten now. My great concern at this point is that we make sure we've got our contact tracing up and running. We have increased testing significantly. So we are getting ready for a point where we can begin to reopen the economy.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's some pressure on you. I mean, you had the mayor of Chicago say that residents aren't abiding by these calls to stay at home. You've had protests in Chicago, in Southern Illinois as well. Is the politics of this complicating things for you?\u00a0GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Not at all. I'm not thinking about the politics. I'm thinking about saving lives and keeping people healthy in our state. The fact is that there is-- there are millions of people in the state of Illinois who have been following our stay-at-home rule, and they are the ones who have bent this curve for us. It is true there are outliers. The mayor and I have talked several times about the challenge of people wanting to break the rules. But the truth is those are real outliers. And even the protesters, there were only a few hundred protesters. And although, you know, they sometimes carry reprehensible signs and, you know, are attacking what we're trying to do, we're still trying to keep them healthy as we are the 12.7 million Illinoisans across the state.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The presidential adviser, Jared Kushner, gave an interview this week. You heard a clip of it in the beginning of the show. And he said the country is on the medical aspect side of this improving and that the federal government rose to the challenge. Did the federal government rise to the challenge and meet your state's needs?\u00a0GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, it's the governors that have risen to the challenge, you know, I talked to my fellow governors, Republicans and Democrats. We have shared ideas with one another about how to keep people safe. We've gotten some guidance from the CDC that's been helpful. But much of what came out of the White House for many weeks was not helpful. We needed the White House to lead on the Defense Production Act to help us get swabs, to help us get VTM, to help us get reagents. That really hasn't much happened, although recently we got a call from the White House telling us that in May they're sending us six hundred thousand swabs, and I'm very grateful for that. We've, of course, overcome our challenges more recently and increased testing significantly. We're now among the top ten states in-- in America, we're number two for testing. We've got to get our contact tracing up and going. And then, as I say, we can reopen the economy as we see our hospitalizations begin to wane.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you agree then with Kushner when he says the biggest thing holding testing back is the state's ability to collect more samples?\u00a0GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: You know a couple of weeks ago or maybe a week ago, the White House said that we have all the capacity we need. Well, they're right in the sense that there are plenty of machines that exist in the state of Illinois. But there weren't enough swabs, VTM and reagent. There still aren't. But the White House is helping, and I appreciate that--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it enough?\u00a0GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: But re-- it's not enough. It's not enough today. But, again, as a state, we're having to go out in the market and compete with every other state to get swabs and VTM and reagents. I wish that the White House had stepped up earlier; and I think they still have the opportunity to do so when it comes to reagent. But the fact is that we're going to overcome this. I believe by mid-summer we'll be able to do tens of thousands more tests. And just, again, in May, we'll be able to do more than we're doing today, which is in the high teens.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, you know, I-- I know that you have said and other governors have said that they will need more federal aid because of this crisis. But I want you to respond to to this because before the crisis, Illinois had one of the worst pension problems in the country. By your state's own admission, the pensions were underfunded by hundred and twenty-nine billion in 2019. Citing numbers like this, Republicans have characterized any emergency help now as, essentially, a bailout of-- of poor management. I mean, the President slammed you this week in a presser as well. Is-- is it reasonable for Congress if they put together the emergency aid you're asking for to attach strings that restrict how you spend it?\u00a0GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, let's point out that-- that all fifty states are suffering from a failure of revenues to come in over the last couple of months. Coronavirus has caused that. All of us are having to spend more on social services and health care to take care of people. And as far as Illinois goes we balanced the budget this year. We were on our way to a balanced budget for next year as well. So all we've asked for, and, frankly, the other forty-nine states, too, as far as I know, is just help to replace those revenues that we all lost--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You--\u00a0GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: --as a result of this invisible killer.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- so do you think you'll get the money and will there be strings attached?\u00a0GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: I don't know whether there'll be strings attached. I hope there aren't too many, because the fact is every state has a problem and it's different in every state where they need to put the dollars. So putting more strings on it makes it much more difficult for us to move forward to get our economies going. Remember, Illinois has one of the most important economies in the world, not to mention in the nation.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Certainly.\u00a0GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: So the federal government is really the only entity that can step in and help us out.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be watching that, Governor. Good luck to you.\u00a0GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who joins us from Westport, Connecticut, this morning. Good morning to you.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So these federal social distancing guidelines expire this week. It's a-- a different story state to state over what's opening up. But you tweeted this week that you saw some worrying-- worrisome signals, specifically, when it comes to hospitalization rates. What is the direction of the epidemic?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, when you look across the country, it's really a mixed bag. Certainly cases are falling in the Tri-State region around New York City. But when you back out what's happening in New York, and New York is really driving a lot of the national statistics because it was such a large outbreak, around the nation, hospitalizations and new cases continue to rise. So there's about twenty states where you see a rising number of new cases: Illinois, Texas, Maryland, Indiana, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee have a lot of new cases on a daily basis. And so while mitigation didn't fail, I think it's fair to say that it didn't work as well as we expected. We expected that we would start seeing more significant declines in new cases and deaths around the nation at this point. And we're just not seeing that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning Doctor Deborah Birx was on another network, and she said our projections were always that we would see between a hundred thousand and two hundred and forty thousand Americans' lives lost due to the virus. On Monday of this week, the President said it's probably sixty to seven-- seventy thousand dead. The week before, he said fifty to sixty thousand. Are these White House numbers reliable at all?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, the White House was looking at the IHME model out of Washington State. And that model initially showed at the high end two hundred and fifty thousand deaths and a base case of a hundred thousand. But it's come down since then to about seventy thousand. It's starting to creep back up when you look at the updates of that model over the last two weeks. I think we have to look out to what's going to happen by the end of June. It's really hard to predict beyond June where this goes because we could have large outbreaks or it could become quiescent in the summer. But I think when you look out to the end of June, it's probably the case that we're going to get above a hundred thousand deaths nationally. I think the concerning thing here is that we're looking at the prospect that this may be a persistent spread, that while the doubling time has come down dramatically to about twenty-five days. So the amount of days it takes for the epidemic to double in size is about twenty-five now, from day-- days or less than a week at the outset of this epidemic. We may be facing the prospect that twenty thousand, thirty thousand new cases a day diagnosed becomes a new normal and a thousand or more deaths becomes a new normal as well. Right now we're seeing, for about thirty days now, about thirty thousand cases a day and two thousand deaths a day. And if you factor in that we're probably diagnosing only one in ten infections--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --those thirty thousand cases are really three hundred thousand cases.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Persistent spread is what you called it. So if we're going back to reopening business and life in America, what does that look like? You had airlines this week issue new guidelines. They're asking people to wear masks, giving them to them when they board. If someone has asthma, if someone has diabetes, something that makes them vulnerable. Is it safe for them to get on a plane when there's persistent spread?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, this may be the new normal. And we need to know what that looks like, and it's going to be a case where people who have comorbidities, have conditions that could lead to a bad outcome if they get infected, are going to need to be very careful. That may be the future that we're looking at. You know the challenge is that if we see this slow simmer through this summer--maybe this summer's a backstop to spread, I think it will be. But we see this sort of persistent twenty thousand cases a day, maybe thirty thousand, but it probably comes down a little. We see a persistent one thousand or more deaths a day. That's through this summer. But what happens when we come back in the fall and schools are back in session, colleges are back in session--residential college campuses. People are letting their guard down a little bit more. People are back at work after an August recess. And then you can see this slow simmer explode into a new epidemic or large outbreaks. That's the concern, that if we don't snuff this out more and you have this slow burn of infection, it can ignite at any time.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been warning of looking ahead to the fall, that that hasn't been addressed yet. You've also talked to us about this drug, remdesivir, that the FDA gave emergency authorization for this week. Is that one of the tools in the tool box that you say will exist in the fall that could make this better?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's right. I think the more that we see persistent infection, the more we're dependent upon a technological change to really be an inflection point in this epidemic. Remdesivir is an effective drug. It's going to help some patients, especially when used early in the course of disease, to reduce hospitalizations, and reduce death. There's also the antibody drugs that we talked about that could be available by the fall. And vaccines may be available by the fall in doses sufficient to ring fence infections in cities while we continue to study them to make sure they're safe and effective for mass inoculation. I think the more that the government accepts the fact that there's just going to be persistent spread and they want to open the economy against that backdrop, the more they better be doubling down on the technology and make sure that we're doing--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --everything we can to get those drugs in time for the fall.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You said there may be a vaccine by the fall? That-- the Trump administration has set January in this Operation Warp Speed as their goal for three hundred million doses. Do you think it will be ready before that?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think what we're going to have in the fall is, hopefully, multiple manufacturers that have cleared early stage safety trials and have millions of doses that could be deployed in large-- large-scale studies inside cities. And so what you would do is deploy the vaccine in the setting of an outbreak in a city to both test whether it's safe and effective. So you're continuing to study it, but you're also using it potentially, therapeutically, to ring fence an outbreak. I think we're going to be in a position to do that. And I know companies are working on protocols, designing trials, to engage in that kind of deployment of vaccines. What we need right now is more than one manufacturer to be successful. We need multiple manufacturers, U.S.-based manufacturers, to have vaccines ready to deploy in time for the fall.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know the country's two largest known coronavirus clusters are in prisons in Ohio. You hear about clusters in nursing homes, also in meat processing plants. There's a school of thought that says because these are highly concentrated, that somehow they're more manageable. What do you make of that argument?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, it's true to some extent. It might not be more manageable, but it's more vulnerable, and I think we need to understand that. Disadvantaged communities and certain kind of institutional settings where people can't naturally social distance are hotspots. They're very vulnerable. And we need to be putting resources into those kinds of settings. And it's not just the shop floors and warehouses and workers who are vulnerable to infection because of the way they work. That's certainly part of the story. But it's also people who come from communities where they have to take mass transit. They can't naturally social distance. They don't have access to good health care to begin with and can't get access to testing. Those communities are very vulnerable, and the data now supports that. We're seeing pockets of intense spread in these kinds of settings, in these kinds of communities, and we should be pouring resources in to help those people.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Gottlieb, thanks as always, for your insight.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now is Daniel O'Day, chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences, that's the pharmaceutical company that makes remdesivir. Good morning to you.\u00a0DANIEL O'DAY (Chairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences): Good morning, Margaret. Thank you for having me on.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So this drug shaves about four days off the recovery time of someone hospitalized with coronavirus, according to the government study. Now that your company has this emergency use authorization, how quickly will the drug get to those people who need it?\u00a0DANIEL O'DAY: Well, you know, I think I speak on behalf of all of us at Gilead that we are grateful and really humbled that everything has moved so quickly. You know, it's only been three months since the first case was diagnosed in the United States to the emergency use authorization that was provided this past Friday. That's thanks to a lot of patients and caregivers that participated in our clinical trials.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DANIEL O'DAY: And we are now firmly focused on getting this medicine to the-- the most urgent patients around the country here in the United States. And, Margaret, we intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week, beginning to work with the government, which will determine which cities are most vulnerable and-- and where the patients are that need this medicine.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I think that's important. You're saying you've-- you've donated some of this drug to the federal government, and you will work with the federal government to decide where the drug goes? Or is that up to the federal government to decide?\u00a0DANIEL O'DAY: Right, Margaret. So we've donated the entire supply that we have within our supply chain. And we did that because we acknowledge and recognize the human suffering, the human need here and want to make sure that nothing gets in the way of this getting to patients. And what we will do is-- is provide that donation to the U.S. government and they will determine, based upon things like ICU beds, where the course of the epidemic is in the United States. They will begin shipping tens of thousands of treatment courses out early this week and be adjusting that as the epidemic shifts and evolves in different parts, in different cities here in the United States.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Okay. Well, we have more to talk about with you, but I have to take a quick break here. So stay with us, and stay with us, all of you as well, please. More with Daniel O'Day in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: With all the news focused on the tragedy of COVID-19 you'd never know it but Election Day is six months from today. We have a new CBS News poll out this morning and that will be coming up in our next half hour.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more from Daniel O'Day.\u00a0And later, we'll talk to the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Raphael Bostic for a snapshot of the economy.\u00a0And is it safe to fly? Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly joins us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to pick up where we left off with Daniel O'Day, the head of Gilead Sciences, which produces the drug remdesivir, which was just given emergency use authorization.\u00a0I want to pick up on this. You said the-- the supply of one and a half million doses of remdesivir has been donated to the government. That's enough for what, a hundred and fifty thousand patients or so?\u00a0DANIEL O'DAY: Right, Margaret. Just to be clear, what we've done is we've donated the entirety of our supply, which is around 1.5 million vials, and that turns into around a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand treatment courses depending on whether it's a five-day or a ten-day. And this donation will be made available to patients here in America and the United States and across the world as other regulatory decisions are taken for those countries.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: This drug is clearly going to be in demand since it's the-- the first sort of promising development we've had. You were at the White House, has the Trump administration talked to you at all about using the Defense Production Act to somehow mandate that you prioritize the U.S. market over foreign markets?\u00a0DANIEL O'DAY: Yeah, let me say something on the supply and the demand, because, you know, I am so proud to work with the scientists at Gilead that, you know, that quickly moved and mobilized themselves in January, long before we knew whether the medicine would be available, to increase the supply. This is a long supply process. It used to take around twelve months, and now it takes around six months. And because of the steps we took in January, we'll have significantly more supply in the second half of this year to serve the suffering and the human needs out there. We've been working very closely with the U.S. government, with other governments around the world. In terms of the allocation question, I think we're aligned with the U.S. government to both serve the patients here in the United States and then to be able to also make sure, as a global company based here in the United States, that we can serve other countries around the world as well. We've had very good dialogues with the government--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DANIEL O'DAY: --and that's going well.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So they haven't talked to you about mandating the U.S. market be prioritized or taking it for the stockpile, for example. You can still export it?\u00a0DANIEL O'DAY: That's correct. We have been exporting for clinical trials and for compassionate use, thousands of treatment courses. And-- and our collaboration with the government has been such that we've been very transparent with them here in the United States. And we have a good relationship on-- on future allocation.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: This drug you have to get through an I.V. right now, so it works for hospitalized patients. Will you develop other mechanisms? Does this ever become a pill someone can take at home?\u00a0DANIEL O'DAY: Yes. It's important to note that this medicine is really right now for the most severe patients in the hospital, and it's given by I.V. either through a five-day treatment course or a ten-day treatment course, depending on the stage and nature of the patient. But our scientists have been working since earlier this year to say, are there other ways that we could deliver this medicine, potentially, as Doctor Gottlieb mentioned, to earlier patients.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0DANIEL O'DAY: And in order to do that, we're looking at formulations such as subcutaneous formulations that may be given outside the hospital setting and possibly an inhaled version. This medicine is not suitable for oral administration because of the way it's metabolized. But there are ways we can look at formulations potentially that would get us to earlier patients and patients outside the hospital setting. That research is still ongoing, yet, hasn't yet read out. And we'll certainly keep you up to speed on that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We will be watching. Thank you very much, Mister O'Day.\u00a0DANIEL O'DAY: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Trump administration predicts a significant comeback for the economy by the end of the year. But last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell was blunt.\u00a0JEROME POWELL: Both the depth and the duration of the economic downturn are extraordinarily uncertain. I think everyone is suffering here, but I think those who are least able to-- to bear it are the ones who-- who are, you know, losing their jobs.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Chairman Powell also urged the Trump administration and Congress to take more emergency action. And he announced a loan program for medium-sized companies to help keep them running.\u00a0We turn now to the head of one of the twelve banks that make up the Federal Reserve System, Raphael Bostic. He is in Atlanta this morning. Good morning to you.\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC (President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta/@RaphaelBostic): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We just heard that very bleak assessment, in some ways, from the Federal Reserve chair. In the past six weeks alone, thirty million Americans have filed for unemployment claims. Are we headed for a depression?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, when I-- when I think about this question, I think the first thing to be mindful of is that the Federal Reserve is acting boldly and decisively to try to provide support for markets all across this country. Look, we knew that coming out of this public health crisis our-- that the response was going to do damage to the economy. And that was required if we were going to get to the other side. What we've tried to do is really provide support to give people a bridge from that pre-virus situation to the post-virus situation. And let me just say, in terms of the numbers, I think we knew that the jobless numbers were going to be bad for March. They're going to be tough again this Friday. But I think the real question, the thing I'm focusing on, is how many of these-- these jobs are going to-- job losses are going to be permanent as opposed to those that are going to be temporary losses. And a lot of the--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And what is the answer to that question?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, we're going to-- we're-- we are-- a lot of the-- the responses that we've been doing have been aimed to try to provide support and relief. And what I would tell you is right now it's too soon to tell.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: The-- the Pay-- Paycheck Protection Program, that money is just getting into the system. The economic impact payments, those are just going into the hands of families and households. And what we're going to do over the next week and several weeks is continue our outreach. Call businesses, talk to people and really try to find out whether the relief that's been offered has-- is sufficient--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: --or whether they need more. And also whether there are pockets that are missing. And if there are, we will talk to policymakers and make sure they're aware of it, to see if there are other things that might be done.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The-- the actions the Fed have taken are pretty unprecedented. In terms of things that you are forecasting and warning about, I know you personally, last month, said that the month of May could be make it or break it for many businesses. It's not just about cash anymore. It's about staying solvent. Does that mean you're predicting a large number of bankruptcies in the weeks to come?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: No, it doesn't mean that at all. And let me just provide some context. We know that for many businesses and for many families, they don't have six or seven or eight months of savings. Instead, they may only have one or two months of savings, which means we're getting about to the time when those savings are going to be depleted. This is why so many of the actions that have been taken have been so important, getting relief into families. And so what we're trying to do right now is understand to what extent is that relief providing its service and keeping people away from those bankruptcies because it is not in our interests for those bankruptcies to happen. That will mean that much more of this is permanent than temporary. And we're going to do all we can to make sure that doesn't happen.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're president of the Atlanta Fed. That means you monitor closely what's happening in the American South. States like Florida and Georgia are reopening. What do-- what do these initial days and weeks indicate to you? I mean, just because consumers can go out, does that mean they're actually going out and spending?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, we've talked-- we've talked to a lot of folks, a lot of consumers, and a lot of businesses, and what we're hearing is that many are actually being quite thoughtful in terms of how they're approaching this. You know, one of the things that is very important as you look through the South is that the virus is presenting itself differently in different populations. We know that African Americans are being hit much harder by this. And so the response of how we reopen the economy has got to be thoughtful. What I've been encouraged by is that many businesses that have the option are choosing not to do that where I've talked to a number of leaders of-- of important and small businesses that say we're going to keep doing our restaurant, our curbside delivery. We're going to keep doing our social distancing to try to make sure that as we open up we don't do it in a way that adversely impacts the population and leads to another spike in terms of infections.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed chair was clear that he is watching closely what's happening in the mortgage market. So many Americans have had to put off their monthly payments. What level of risk is there? You know the housing market. What level of risk is there that we are facing a banking or a financial crisis in the months ahead?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, I-- I was in-- in the government through the last crisis when it was a housing crisis. And, fortunately, this is not that right now. What I would say is this is that there have been some policies put in place.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But could it be in the months ahead? Is that what this warning-- that you're watching closely, the mortgage servicers? Is that what you're saying?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, what I'm saying is that we're going to do what it takes to make sure that doesn't happen, that we-- we know where there are stress points. We know where there are tensions. And if we see those tensions start to get to a higher level, we're going to-- we're going to encourage policymakers across the spectrum to do that. One other thing I would say is that the banking sec-- sector coming into this crisis is much stronger than it was in 2007 and 2008. There's much more capital.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: We've taken a lot of steps to make sure that-- that banks do have resources available so that they are not in that insolvency space. And I'm hopeful that they're going to be able to be part of the solution in terms of extending capital, mod-- modifying the mortgages--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: --and loans and financial relationships they have with businesses and households in ways that reduces the tension and allows families to be able to forbear for even longer than they can right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the things that the Fed did this week was say that it'll, essentially, buy more debt of-- of local governments to help them out. As we've been hearing from governors and local leaders, they are under a lot of financial stress right now. But the Fed chair also said that's basically not-- the Fed's job is to lend money, not to spend money. He-- he pointed right at Congress and said it's up to you to do something at this point. What is it that the states need in terms of relief, from your point of view, from what you are seeing?\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, first, I would just say that as the Federal Reserve, we stand ready to act as much as we can within the limits of the law. And the chair was exactly right. We are-- we have limits as to what we can do and how much support we can offer. I think it's an open question as to how much more is going to be needed. And we're going to continue, as we engage with governments and helping them with their financing, to understand the depth of that need--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: --and then communicate that to policymakers so they can decide how much extra support might be necessary. But, you know, for us, we are very much in a situation--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: --where we're going to do what we can, what we're legally allowed to do as much as we can.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: And then take information and get that to policymakers--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0RAPHAEL BOSTIC: --so they can decide the next step.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you very much.\u00a0We'll be right back with Gary Kelly, the head of Southwest Airlines.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The airlines are just one of the many industries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. With the number of air travelers plummeting ninety-six percent, half the U.S. fleet of planes is grounded, and the planes that are taking off are nearly empty, averaging just seventeen passengers per domestic flight. Congress has given the industry fifty billion dollars in financing, either as loans or grants. Despite that assistance, the four biggest carriers reported massive first-quarter losses last week.\u00a0One of those airlines is Southwest Air. Gary Kelly is the company's chairman and CEO, and he joins us from Dallas this morning. Good morning to you.\u00a0GARY KELLY (Chairman and CEO, Southwest Airlines/@gary_kelly): Hi, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it safe to fly again?\u00a0GARY KELLY: It is. You know, we're-- we're-- we're doing everything possible to encourage people to come back and fly. We're cleaning airplanes. We're requiring masks of our employees and our customers. We're using very deep cleanings every night. We're using electrostatic misters, which will kill the virus on surfaces for up to thirty days. We're exercising social distancing. And on board the aircraft, we-- we won't be booking airplanes full so that people can spread out. So, absolutely, we're doing everything we can to make it as safe as humanly possible.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And you stopped things like food service and the like. I mean, those sound like good measures. But, you know, we had a guest on our program last week, Barry Diller, who is-- is a big investor. And he said it's just absurd if you do things like remove the middle seat to have some spacing. I mean, to his point, you still have a confined space. You still have a shared bathroom. You still have people who are walking down the aisle, going to their seat, walking past you. How-- I mean how much risk is there? What do you think the measures you're taking do to offset everything else?\u00a0GARY KELLY: I don't think the risk on-- on an airplane is any greater risk than anywhere else, and, in fact, you just look at the layered approach that we use. It's-- it's as safe as an environment as you're going to find. We're using hospital quality disinfectants, HEPA air filters to make sure that the air is-- is properly filtered and clean. We're not going-- going to remove middle seats or prohibit people from sitting in middle seats. But, at the same time, we won't book the airplanes full. So, you know, if you choose, all the middle seats can be open.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know you said at one point that-- that what you're going through now was worse than after 9/11, which is extraordinary. But I mean is the bottom line here that cheap travel is over for Americans for the future, that the business is just completely changing and that the future is uncertain?\u00a0GARY KELLY: Well, sure, the future is uncertain. But, you know, right now we're-- we're at a low point. And so I just don't think it's right to extrapolate today in-- into perpetuity.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0GARY KELLY: So we'll get through this. But, in the meantime, I think it's actually the-- the opposite. After 9/11, Herb Kelleher was famous for saying that we're all low-fare carriers now because that's what it's going to take to get people flying. And that is certainly the case today. And I think we're very well prepared for that. We've got a strong balance sheet. We've got a lot of cash. We've got a great business model and a low-cost structure. But we're going to have to fight our way through this. And, obviously, I'm anxious to see how the travel demand develops here in the summer.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It's picking up?\u00a0GARY KELLY: Well, I-- yeah. I think we've seen the bottom here in-- in April. Each week after the first week of April has gotten successively better. I think May will be better than April was, and I-- I don't think June will be a good month, but, hopefully, it will be a bit better than May. And then we're looking forward to July and August, and we'll just have to see. There are bookings in place. But those could easily be canceled. So it's-- it's really one day at a time.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Southwest has taken about 3.2 billion in federal aid. Do you expect to take more?\u00a0GARY KELLY: You know I mean the first thing is to re-- really thank the Congress, the administration, Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Chao, because what was needed for our country was a lot of liquidity. And the CARES Act was exactly what we needed to avoid a-- a really serious depression. We've applied for another government loan. I don't know that we'll take it. I think what the government has done for us with this CARES Act is it really has opened up the capital markets.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0GARY KELLY: A month ago we couldn't have borrowed money, we couldn't have raised equity. And we were able to raise six billion dollars last week. So I think that we've got what we need to see our way through. But if we have to seek another government loan, we will do that. We have until September to make that decision.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And we know because of the first round you took that you can't lay off anyone until after September 30. That was part of the-- the CARES Act provision. I know, though, you recently told employees that if business doesn't pick up by July, that you'll become a dramatically smaller airline. What does that mean? Are you laying the groundwork for job cuts?\u00a0GARY KELLY: Well, you know, I think you summarized it well with your-- with your comments. The-- the planes are virtually empty, and we've got-- at Southwest alone we've got close to four hundred airplanes that are parked. The-- the-- the demand is just not there. So, obviously, if things don't improve, we have to downsize. We've never had a furlough in our history. We've never had a pay cut in our history. And I'm extraordinarily proud of that. And we certainly don't want to break that record. What I promised our people is I don't know what the future holds, but I do know that we're very well prepared--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0GARY KELLY: --and the very last thing that we'll do--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0GARY KELLY: --is have an involuntary furlough.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0GARY KELLY: So we'll just have to see how things play out and do our best to avoid those-- those-- those kinds of results.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for your time. We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It's six months until Election Day and there is news from the campaign trail. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden publicly denied a former aide's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in 1993. Our CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe reports.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0JOE BIDEN: In every case, the truth is what matters. And, in this case, the truth is these claims are false.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Joe Biden on Saturday once again denied accusations of sexual assault. His accuser, Tara Reade, worked for him for nine months ending in 1993. Last year she was among several women who recounted what they called inappropriate touching by Biden. She began detailing more serious allegations for the first time in March.\u00a0TARA READE (Northern California): I remember his hands underneath my bust, underneath my skirt. And his fingers penetrating me as he was kiss-- trying to kiss me, and I was pulling away.\u00a0WOMAN: (INDISTINCT)) going to win today?\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Reade supported Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary and began speaking out again as Biden was on the verge of securing the nomination. CBS News has spoken multiple times with Reade and we have requested an on-camera interview. She is the only individual who has accused Biden of sexual assault. Some of her acquaintances, former colleagues, and her brother tell CBS News they recall her mentioning the alleged Biden episode in the 1990s, but details of her brother's account have differed in interviews with other news outlets. Several former Biden Senate aides have said that they never heard about Reade's allegations while working for him. And Attorney Bill Jeffress, who led the vetting of Biden for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, tells CBS News that his investigation never turned up allegations of sexual misconduct.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And Ed O'Keefe joins us. Ed, it's good to see you and to talk about politics again. This story, I mean, it-- it opens up a lot of questions, but-- and-- and it's important to investigate these kind of allegations. Politically, if President Trump faces accusations from more than twenty individuals about sexual harassment and abuse, does it hurt Biden if it didn't hurt Trump? I mean is there a political cost?\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: We'll see. A lot of this is going to boil down to whether or not there are any records of a complaint that Reade says she made to a Senate personnel office back in the 1990s about general harassment concerns with Biden. He's called for their release. But Republicans especially this morning are making a hypocrisy argument that if it was a big deal for Donald Trump, it was-- if it was a big deal for Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, shouldn't it also be a big deal for Joe Biden's presidential prospects. You're right. Trump won the White House, Kavanaugh got confirmed. We'll see, ultimately, whether or not it matters for Biden and his fortunes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, I want to ask you about some of our CBS News polling, because we have new data out today and this new national poll shows that in the head-to-head matchup, Biden is ahead of President Trump by six points, forty-nine percent versus forty-three percent. And since the Biden campaign started officially vetting vice-presidential possibilities last week, he's pledged to name a female running mate. So we then asked who Democratic voters would like to see on the ticket alongside him. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is the top choice among Democrats polled at thirty-six percent, followed by California's Senator Kamala Harris at nineteen percent, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams at fourteen percent, Senator Amy Klobuchar comes in at thirteen percent. So it's interesting, but when it comes to the guy at the top of the ticket, Biden himself, what does this indicate? Why is Trump behind him?\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Well, he's always been either pretty much tied or very close with Biden in head-to-head-- head-to-head matchups. And he is known nationally, as well as in a lot of these battleground states. Part of the issue here is the economy. He wanted to run on a strong economy. He can't do that anymore. And if the economy continues to crater, it's going to be really difficult for him to continue making that argument.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's difficult to campaign, period, these days. President Trump tweeted this morning: \"Hopefully, our country will soon mend. We're all missing our wonderful rallies.\" Is the country missing political rallies, Ed?\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Well, look, the President may be itching to get back out there, but a new poll out this morning, our new poll, finds that voters say they're seeing the President too much. Just eleven percent saying they're seeing the President enough. And while Biden has been holed up in his Delaware basement doing TV interviews and holding virtual rallies, voters say they'd actually like to see more of him. Forty-seven percent say they'd like to see him more often. Perhaps the good news for both of these men, they like to campaign, they're strong retail politicians. And, overwhelming, eighty-four percent of voters in our polls say that just because they're out there-- they're not out there doing rallies, won't affect their final decision. In other words, voters telling the candidates it's okay, stay home.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And there is nothing typical about this race, this year, this moment.\u00a0ED O'KEEFE: Not at all.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And Ed, I know-- Ed, you'll be watching it closely for us. Thank you.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0\u00a0",

Tara Reade said on a\u00a0podcast\u00a0in March that in 1993, Biden penetrated her with his hand while in the U.S. Capitol complex, when she was a staff assistant in his Senate office.\u00a0 The allegation expanded on her previous claims a year ago that Biden had harassed her 27 years ago. In a television interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Biden was asked directly whether he had sexually assaulted Reade in 1993. \"No, it is not true,\" he said. \"I'm saying unequivocally, it never, never happened.\" Biden said that while women who make accusations like this \"deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard,\" their stories \"should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny.\"\u00a0 Before the morning TV interview, Biden released a statement questioning her claim, noting that she said she had \"raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers,\" but the two people identified said \"unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues.\"\u00a0 The former VP wrote in his statement that any complaints by Reade \u2014 if they exist \u2014 should be released by the secretary of the Senate. Senate personnel records are managed by the secretary of the Senate, who did not respond to requests for comment. Some have questioned whether there is a mention of Reade in Biden's personal Senate papers, housed at the University of Delaware. Biden insists there is not, and said he doesn't want them released yet because they are mostly political. The papers are scheduled to become public two years after Biden leaves public office. Read more here about CBS News' reporting about Reade's accusation and the Biden's campaign's response to the allegations. FROM THE CANDIDATES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP Twice in the past two days, President Trump has addressed sexual assault allegations made against his presumed 2020 Democratic rival, Joe Biden. Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday testimony from Tara Reade \"could be false accusations,\" reports CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. He added, \"I have been falsely charged numerous times. And there is such a thing.\" In a\u00a0podcast interview with supporter Dan Bongino\u00a0Friday, the president expressed sympathy for the former vice president, noting he too has been accused of sexual assault. \"I guess in a way, you could say I'm sticking up for him,\" Trump told listeners, in his lengthiest comments yet about the accusation, which Biden addressed directly Friday for the first time, unequivocally denying Reade's claim. Reade said on a\u00a0podcast\u00a0in March that while working in Biden's Senate office in 1993 as a staff assistant, he pushed her against a wall in an office building, put his hand up her skirt and penetrated her with his hand. The allegation went beyond her previous claims of harassment. Biden flatly denied Reade's accusation in an interview on MSNBC on Friday morning, calling upon the National Archives to release documents \"relevant\" to her allegation. \"It's a terrible thing, it's a very scary thing,\" Mr. Trump said of the situation, Friday. \"With that, Biden's going to have to go out and fight his own battles.\" The president suggested more accusers could \"come out\" against the former vice president in the future. \"He'll probably have others come out. He might,\" Trump said. At this point, Reade is the only woman who has ever alleged that Biden sexually assaulted her. This is familiar territory for the president. More than a dozen women have accused him of sexual misconduct, including columnist E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s. The ongoing claims waged against Trump range from inappropriate comments to sexual assault. Today, the President also announced plans to visit Keystone, South Dakota ahead of the fourth of July, for a fireworks display at Mount Rushmore National Memorial. \"I'm going to go there on July 3rd and they're gonna have the big fireworks,\" the President told podcast host Dan Bongino.

VEEPSTAKES ELIZABETH WARREN The office that monitors the Small Business Administration said it has opened dozens of investigations into fraud in the distribution of loans meant to keep small businesses afloat and paying their employees during the COVID-19 crisis, following requests from Senator Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers for it to do so. \"I want to assure you my office will perform our work to the highest standards to promote transparency of this vital stimulus program and make recommendations for corrective action to ensure the funds are used efficiently, effectively and in accordance with the law,\" SBA Inspector General Hannibal \"Mike\" Ware wrote in a letter to Warren and Representative Nydia Velazquez.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says the lawmakers had written to Ware a week earlier, asking that his office review whether the SBA and Treasury Department had ensured lenders and small businesses could access Paycheck Protection Program loans \"quickly and equitably\" and that it minimized waste, fraud and abuse.\u00a0 They also called for an investigation into whether banks played favorites with wealthier customers and whether companies with political connections received priority access to loans. Ware noted that his office had been proactive in releasing fraud schemes related to PPP and had been the first to commission reports on waste, fraud and abuse in COVID-19 funding.\u00a0 He said his office plans to release a flash report on PPP implementation at the request of several other senators by May 8 and another on the the loan forgiveness piece of the program. Ware also said they planned to investigate the questions posed by the lawmakers.\u00a0 \"It is unlikely that a single review will cover all three aspects sought in your request; however, we believe our planned work, to include the flash reports, will provide the transparency necessary to inform the concerns noted relative to lending practices of the banks in implementing PPE,\" he wrote. \u00a0 GRETCHEN WHITMER Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive order on Friday that will allow some low-risk industries, such as construction and real-estate activities, to get back to work on May 7. But as she faces pressure to reopen more parts of the state and a possible legal challenge from the GOP-controlled legislature over her use of executive powers, Whitmer says she'll continue making decisions based on advice from public health experts.\u00a0 \"I will not be making decisions based on an arbitrary timeline or political or legal pressure. I'm not here to play games,\" she told reporters during her briefing on Friday. She accused Republicans in the legislature of engaging in \"political gamesmanship without substance\" after they refused to extend Michigan's state of emergency and authorized leaders to take legal action against Whitmer for her COVID-19 response. After the legislature did not extend the state of emergency, Whitmer signed\u00a0executive orders\u00a0Thursday night keeping it in place through May 28. CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says Whitmer also responded to a\u00a0tweet\u00a0from President Trump on Friday morning calling on her to \"make a deal\" with the protestors who showed up at the Capitol building in Lansing to protest Whitmer's stay at home order.\u00a0 \"These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again,\" Trump tweeted. \"We're not in a political crisis where we should just negotiate and find some common ground here. We're a public health crisis,\" Whitmer said.\u00a0 She opened her briefing by talking about the protesters, including some who were armed and entered the Capitol building, criticizing some of the attendees. \"Yesterday's scene at the Capitol was disturbing, to be quite honest,\" Whitmer said. \"Swastikas and Confederate flags, nooses and automatic rifles do not represent who we are as Michiganders.\" Whitmer declined to say whether she should remove her name from the list of potential vice presidential nominees, given the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. But she insisted, \"all of my focus is right here at home in Michigan. This is the only place I've ever called home. And this is the place where I always want to be.\" AD WARS BIDEN V. TRUMP President Donald Trump's re-election campaign has spent over $54 million on Facebook and Google advertisements since the 2018 midterm elections. By comparison, the Biden campaign has spent just under $19 million on the same platforms since his 2019 launch. While the president has outspent Joe Biden digitally overall, Biden has outpaced Mr. Trump specifically in Facebook spending since the end of March. According to Bully Pulpit Interactive's 2020 Campaign Tracker, Mr. Trump has spent $7 million on Facebook and Google while Biden has spent $5.3 million from March 28 to April 25, but Biden has spent $4.3 million to Trump's $4.1 million on Facebook.\u00a0 CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0and\u00a0Eleanor\u00a0Watson\u00a0note a review of the Facebook ad library found many of the ads that Biden has aired on the social network over the past month involve \"healing\" the soul of the nation, taking on Mr. Trump, teasing his VP pick, defeating the NRA, protecting Obamacare, touting endorsements and meeting fundraising goals. The president's ads on Facebook, meanwhile, have focused on slamming Biden and Democrats, building a wall, promoting online events, selling merchandise and reaching fundraising deadlines. PAC ATTACK The pro-Trump America First Action PAC launched a new round of TV ads in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania Friday taking aim at Joe Biden. It's part of the group's $10 million investment in the battleground states through the end of May. In Michigan, an ad titled \"China Prosperity\" has clips of Biden praising China; in Wisconsin, an ad titled \"Stop China\" also uses video of Biden remarks to accuse the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee of trying to protect China amid the coronavirus outbreak; and in Pennsylvania, the ad titled \"Travel Ban\" uses a clip of Biden criticizing the China travel ban. \u00a0 It's the latest in a series of efforts to paint Biden as aligned with China over U.S. interests. At the same time, Democratic groups have made similar efforts to tie Trump with China as well for his initial praise of China's coronavirus response. Meanwhile,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0reports that the Senate Majority PAC, which works to elect Democrats, is running its first television ad in Montana for the 2020 election cycle this weekend. This comes after the state's Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, decided to challenge GOP Senator Steve Daines, putting the race closer in play. The ad titled \"Maybe\" accuses Daines of supporting not only corporate tax cuts, but also cuts to Medicare. It's a six-figure buy that will start running statewide on Saturday. According to Kantar/CMAG tracking, Daines has already spent more than $600,000 on ads in the race, including both TV and digital. Bullock has spent $114,000, but all of his ads so far have been digital. GOVERNOR'S MANSION NEXT STEPS This weekend marks the beginning of \"Phase 1\" for some states, as the federal guidelines on social distancing expires and some\u00a0governors look to gradually reopen businesses\u00a0in their states. Texas, Arkansas, Maine, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Georgia are among some of the states to lift restrictions on restaurants, gyms, hair salons and retailers this weekend or on Monday.\u00a0 In total,\u00a0CBS News counts 35 states\u00a0that have begun or will begin to lift some social distancing regulations. In other states with ongoing increases in COVID-19 cases, governors have extended their stay-at-home orders and are waiting for a clear break in the data to start any notable waves of reopenings.\u00a0 \"It's this simple: Data determines dates. When we see our benchmarks on key factors, like testing or hospitalizations, we can begin considering a specific timetable,\" New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy\u00a0Tweeted\u00a0Friday.\u00a0 For governors in states near regional hotspots like New York and Massachusetts, the approach to reopening has them watching their neighbors for new outbreaks.\u00a0 \"We also have to recognize that states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York \u2013 states right on our borders and just a few hours away \u2013 are still confronting massive outbreaks and it only takes one spark, or one unhelpful decision, to reignite this fire. We all need to continue to be smart, cautious and disciplined to preserve our hard-earned gains,\" Vermont Governor Phil Scott said Friday, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0 TO STAY OR NOT TO STAY The Wisconsin Supreme Court will decide whether Governor Tony Evers' safer at home order will remain in place. The Republican-controlled legislature asked the court to block the order. The court announced on Friday that oral arguments in the case will take place on Tuesday morning.\u00a0 Legislative Republicans filed the lawsuit after Wisconsin Health Secretary-designee, Andrea Palm, extended the safer at home order until May 26 at the direction of Evers. They argue the Evers administration has overreached its executive powers and say Palm didn't have the authority to extend the order on her own. Evers and Palm have defended safer at home, saying it's working to keep Wisconsin safe, and believe the law is on their side. Conservatives hold a 5-2 advantage on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE DOWN BALLOT More than a dozen Democratic House incumbents and several Senate candidates in\u00a0competitive races have yet to endorse\u00a0Joe Biden, nearly a month after the former vice president became his party's\u00a0presumptive presidential nominee, report\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News Associate Producer Eleanor Watson. The holdouts underscore challenges facing Biden as he prepares to lead a party fighting to defend a House majority and win back the Senate.\u00a0 During the primaries, Biden often campaigned on being the candidate to help down-ballot races. \"It's not just whether or not the person you pick as the nominee can win. It's whether or not that person you pick as the nominee can bring along a Democratic Senate,\" Biden said in January.\u00a0 The most vulnerable incumbent Democrats in the Senate have all endorsed Biden, though several candidates challenging incumbent Republicans in battleground states have yet to officially endorse. More than a dozen House Democrat \"Frontline\" members also have yet to endorse, which other Democratic campaign operatives and members tell CBS is a matter of timing, business with the pandemic or keeping their campaign hyper-local.\u00a0 \"Remember, this crop of people was viewed as incredibly independent from the Democratic party,\" former DCCC Executive Director Dan Sera said about the freshman House Democrat class. \"I think there are places where you have to ask, what else is going on politically?\" Read the full story\u00a0here. \u00a0 IN THE HOUSE The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee launched a new \"Virtual Action Center\" on\u00a0Friday, serving as a one-stop shop for volunteers to get connected with House campaigns. Since the pandemic has transformed any sense of traditional campaigning, the center aims to get volunteers involved through virtual events like phone and text banks, registration drives or Zoom conference meetings. Most of these volunteer events begin with a Zoom training session.\u00a0 \"We're giving those Americans a way to change the channel on Washington Republicans \u2013 and they can do it from their sofa,\" DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos said in a statement.\u00a0 The DCCC's hub also highlights the upcoming special election in California's 25th District, where Democrat Christy Smith is facing Republican Mike Garcia for Katie Hill's former seat. President Trump began\u00a0Tweeting\u00a0about the election Tuesday night, pointing out her past comments about Garcia's military service, and pushing the Republican argument that Smith voted to fire teachers. While Smith has apologized about her comments on Garcia, she pushed back against Mr. Trump's argument about her vote,\u00a0saying\u00a0that no teachers were fired.\u00a0 \"I helped manage a school district during the worst of the Great Recession. I'm the candidate in this race endorsed by CFT and NEA. Looking forward to meeting Betsy DeVos in a hearing soon,\" she\u00a0Tweeted.\u00a0 CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says the race between Smith and Garcia in the Los Angeles and Ventura County district is considered a\u00a0toss up, despite Hill's 10-point win in the district in 2018.\u00a0 In a\u00a0Thursday interview\u00a0with Pod Save America, Smith says that Democrats are underperforming compared to Republicans in the ballot returns so far, \"because Republicans more persistently vote.\"\u00a0 \"Everything that's a special election anywhere becomes a tossup, simply because unfortunately, we haven't figured out what that magic is to get our Democratic voters to turnout in those off-cycle elections,\" she said. \"We're taking a different approach with contacting voters, but turnout is everything in this moment.\"\u00a0 Lastly in special election news, there will be a\u00a0debate\u00a0on Monday between Republican Tom Tiffany and Democrat Tricia Zunker in Wisconsin's 7th District, formerly held by Republican Sean Duffy.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "When COVID-19 hit the U.S., public health professionals were already busy battling another epidemic \u2013 the drug crisis in this country. President Trump announced Wednesday that the nation will launch enhanced counter-narcotics operations in the Western Hemisphere to prevent drug cartels from exploiting the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 \"I've seen many families where they're wiped out because they lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife. Or whatever. Or all of them,\" he said of the effects of drug abuse at the Coronavirus Task Force briefing. \"And we don't want to lose ground.\" Leading up to the 2016 election, Trump often tied widespread opioid addiction to his signature campaign theme \u2014 a wall at the U.S. southern border with Mexico \u2014 declaring drugs were pouring into the country through Mexico. \"We are heavily focused on the virus, very heavily focused,\" Trump told reporters Wednesday, but he added that after the operation launches, \"we will never have been so focused on drugs coming into the country as we are right now.\" Yet, beyond U.S. ports of entry, substance abuse patients and health care workers fighting the opioid epidemic face new challenges . \"COVID-19 is like a horrific tsunami that just killed us, exploded in the Northeast and is developing rapidly,\" Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) told CBS News. \"So, of course we're paying attention to it, and we get distracted from this other crisis that is also killing a lot of people.\" The opioid epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic \"have unfortunately crossed paths in a very lethal way,\" Allegra Schorr, president of the Coalition of Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) Providers and Advocates of New York State (COMPA) says. Schorr represents over 45 organizations serving 41,000 recovery patients in New York, the state hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. She wants to strike the right balance between reducing both the spread of the disease and risk of overdose for patients using Medical Assisted Treatment. \"We're like a frontline. We have to be able to keep our patients out of the hospital. We have to get that balance right. If they overdose, then they're going to be in the hospital taking up those resources,\" Schorr told CBS News. \"They could be in the emergency rooms. We have the potential of crashing the hospital system. We have to make sure that does not happen.\" \"Every day there is a change. I think that is the biggest challenge \u2013 the unknown,\" Linda Hurley, president and CEO of CODAC Behavioral Health, told CBS News. Hurley runs the largest non-profit provider of outpatient services for opioid use disorder. Lately, she's seen her patient base grow amid the anxiety and stress of this pandemic. \"On a daily basis, we're seeing more people presenting for admission than what our average was before this crisis.\" Expanding access to medically assisted treatments such as methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone has reduced mortality from opioid overdoses by close to 70%, according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse. Injections of naloxone to reverse overdoses in patients works \"like magic,\" Volkow said, \"but you need to administer it rapidly.\" Nothing is quite as rapid in the age of COVID-19. That means the chances of overdose are rising. \"We already have heard that some patients have overdosed from the methadone because they were not ready to take home these medications,\" she added, referring to the other assisted treatments. Before the crisis, federal regulation required patients receiving methadone treatment to report to clinics six days a week, for their first 90 days. The routine served as both a diversion and stabilizing force in a patient's otherwise chaotic life. Federal guidelines have been limited during the pandemic. \"The only guidance we've had from federal governments and state governments across the country is to gauge how 'clinically stable' your patient is, then give them take-homes. And that leaves you wide open,\" Schorr said, imploring the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to issue clearer protocol, instead of passing along liability to providers. \"Without clear guidelines, as providers, we have a huge vulnerability. We're accepting it because we have to, but we know it is there.\" While most recovery centers remain open for MAT pick-ups and patient onboarding, other non-clinical centers and syringe exchanges have closed, pending the pandemic's decline. Some residential programs have stopped accepting new patients. Director of SOS Recovery Centers in New Hampshire, John Burns, was forced to close his doors in early March. \"No one is paying attention to the fact that if you're homeless, you once had a recovery center. You might have had a public library or community center to go to. You can't go into quarantine when you're living in a tent,\" Burns says. \"There's also a lot of real concern \u2013 some residential detox centers stopped accepting new patients.\" The closure of residential programs is particularly hard on recovering addicts faced with the elements and nowhere else to go, Burns points out. \"How do we shut that down? You wouldn't shut down a dialysis center.\" Still, recovering individuals without housing can't practice social distancing, resulting in higher risk of infection. Many suffering from addiction also possess co-morbid physical conditions; reduced breathing, a lower oxygen level and suppressed immunity are all likely symptoms in opioid-addicted individuals. \"So, you have a double whammy,\" Volkow told CBS News. \"You have a drug that is actively decreasing your ability to fight a viral infection while decreasing your respiration. And if you contract a pulmonary infection, your likelihood of surviving is lower.\" In Manchester, New Hampshire, the Fire Department's Safe Station program has been forced to limit its hours. The first of its kind nationwide, the 24/7 entryway into treatment located at Fire Departments across the city can no longer accommodate those seeking help late at night. If someone comes at 3 a.m., \"we have nowhere to send them, [even] if they meet the criteria to enter the program,\" Manchester Fire Department District Chief Mike Gamache told CBS News. While firefighters are still offering help to those seeking recovery, entry into treatment has become a \"moving target.\"\u00a0 Meanwhile, workers on the frontline are facing glove and mask shortages. The Fire Department says its own PPE supply will likely run out within a week. \"We need personal protective equipment. We need it, and it's not coming. We need masks. We have churches making masks for us,\" Linda Hurley told CBS News. Local churches have stepped up to sew masks for recovery centers in Rhode Island in the interim. She said she's been seeing staff resign after the pandemic \"put them over the edge.\" The facility shutdowns present yet another risk factor \u2013 social isolation. \"Social isolation does not just contribute to the epidemic of addiction, but it also increases the likelihood that people take drugs,\" Volkow said.\u00a0 It's part of the reason opioid use ballooned amid the 2008 recession. \"The opioid epidemic in our country basically grew out of hopelessness and isolation,\" Volkow added. \"And to the extent that the pandemic is going to exacerbate the economic and social situation of certain people, this could increase the risk of people turning to drugs.\" Hurley told CBS News, \"With these increased stressors, this highly confusing time with concerns about family, finance and health \u2013 those are usually triggers for folks.\" Ashley Drew works as a criminal justice case manager for a recovery center in New Hampshire. The past few weeks have brought back memories of her heroin addiction.\u00a0 \"I'm a little over four years clean and sober,\" she said. \"And I feel like I'm back to my grassroots on the very early stages.\" Establishing a great life, routed in routines and work-life balance aided her recovery. \"However, this life that we're currently living is significantly different than the one I was just living.\" \"Boredom, stress, anxiety, all of those feelings\" \u2014 Drew said the outlets once readily available to tackle those feelings have vanished. Luckily, online programs and support groups have helped to fill the gap.\u00a0 Alcoholics Anonymous suspended all in-person meetings, encouraging members to go online instead. For some, the results have been positive. Thirty-year AA veteran Billy T., who asked that his full name not be used, says he's been reunited online with old friends. Colleagues from his AA chapter in Hollywood have rejoined the group online after moving cross-country or overseas. SOS Recovery Community formed a national online support group alongside partner centers in Oregon and Pennsylvania, offering free services to individuals in recovery. The group now reaches an average of 2,000 people daily, holding nine different support meetings via Zoom. During its launch, 9500 unique attendees joined the first week alone, with attendees from 16 different countries. There have been heartwarming moments. Burns recalls when a brand new mother in residential recovery at Hope on Haven Hill celebrated her birthday, hundreds unmuted their conference lines to sing to her over zoom, resulting in \"lots of tears.\" Linda Hurley estimates 10% of her patient population will be challenged without the technology they need. Yet for those who can connect, her therapists who are tele-counseling have found patients more engaged:\u00a0 \"They're absolutely enjoying sitting on their couch comfortably, talking to their therapist or counselor. They're sharing more.\" In New York State, a free mental-health hotline has been established by 6,000 volunteer mental-health professionals so people can \"talk to them about what you're feeling and what stress you're feeling,\" Cuomo announced last week. One other possible upside \u2014this crisis is likely to spur new research into remote medical practices. For example, Dr. Volkow reports that NIDA is researching automatic naloxone injections that could be triggered by themselves if an individual overdoses.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

PHILIP BREEDLOVECORRESPONDENT: AMD. SANDY WINNEFELDPRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON SANDY WINNEFELD:\u00a0Welcome to Intelligence Matters with Michael Morell. I'm retired Admiral Sandy Winnefeld, filling in for Michael while he's on travel. Our guest today is retired Air Force General Phil Breedlove, who served as the 17th Supreme Allied Commander of Europe and as the Commander of U.S.-European Command. Born in Georgia, he attended Georgia Tech and was commissioned through their ROTC program. He flew F-16s in both Europe and Asia and also served as the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. My close association with and deep admiration for Phil began when we were fraternity brothers at Georgia Tech. I'm fond of saying that, at the time, people expected Phil to succeed. Phil is recognized as being one of our most effective, if not our most effective, Supreme Allied Commanders of NATO and has done a lot in his public and private life to point out the danger represented by Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation. Since he retired he's assumed a variety of roles in business and has also taught at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at his alma mater. Phil, welcome to Intelligence Matters. GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Sandy, it's great to be here with you. And I look forward to our conversation. SANDY WINNEFELD:Well, we have a lot to cover today. Before we get into talking a bit about Europe and Asia, the title of this program is, of course, Intelligence Matters. Can you give me a sense, as a long-serving Air Force officer, former four-star general in several key positions, of how you interacted with and depended on the world of intelligence? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Well, as you know, having also been a pilot in your career, in the early more tactical part of my career, it was all about, \"How was I going to prepare for my mission? What was the intelligence required to get to a target, deliver a weapon, etcetera?\" A very tactical look. And that obviously, through the years, changed. As the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, begin to look at what intelligence told me about the requirements that we had to make to shape our Air Force. And then finally, I don't have to tell you that in my role as the SACEUR and as the Commander of U.S.-European Command, and trying to shape policy and the reactions of 28 nations in NATO, intelligence was key. And having not only an understanding of what U.S. intelligence was, but what the intelligence that was agreed to by all 28 nations, what that was, and the problems and opportunities it generated. SANDY WINNEFELD:Phil, let's talk a little bit about Asia, starting with the Korean Peninsula. You did three tours on the Peninsula, including commanding a fighter wing at Kunsan Air Base in 2001. A lot has happened since then. How do you look at the current situation on the Peninsula and the way ahead? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:It remains problematic. We have had people tell us for a long time that the Hermit Kingdom is going to implode and why are we worried about it. And I guess in a glib way, we should ask ourselves, \"How's that working out for us?\" The North continues to pose a threat, not only in a conventional way, but now in a more growing nuclear way. And they're determined to use those advantages to try to build a political situation with South Korea and the rest of the world that would advantage them in their day-to-day operations. SANDY WINNEFELD:We have gone from yelling about \"Little Rocket Man\" to hugs at the demilitarized zone. How do you feel about President Trump's overtures to Kim Jong-un? Have they been productive? Do you agree with them? And do you think the North Koreans will ever give up their nuclear weapons? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:So, Sandy, I think that we want to talk to them. We don't want to fight them. We're sort of playing poker with someone else's chips. It would be the South Korean people that would really pay if we were to begin a conflict on that peninsula. And so I would applaud any president -- I don't want to zero in on what's going on now -- but any president that began a real conversation. I think we have to understand that this is a nation and a set of leadership that is just going to be really hard to deal with. And they really haven't lived up to a lot of their promises in the past, so I think we all need to have a sober judgment of what we might accomplish. But I would say it's better to try than not to try. And so I applaud any president that tries it. As far as giving up their nuclear weapons, I don't think so. The agreed framework in the early '90s under the Clinton years, we gave them tons of money, tons of fuel, tons of food, and we got, really, nothing in return for it. Unless we get persistent, pervasive inspection that allows us to completely understand what North Korea is actually doing, we're going to be at risk in any agreement I think we make with them. SANDY WINNEFELD:Well, and it also seems that we have to be careful about mirror imaging on North Korea. You know, Kim Jong-un has to worry about both external threats, but also internal threats to the\u2014 GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE: Absolutely. SANDY WINNEFELD:--regime. Our relationship with South Korea has, like many of our allies, become a little more transactional lately. We're starting to ask the South Koreans to pay a little bit more for our presence there. Have you got any thoughts for us on U.S. basing of forces in South Korea? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:So it's not going to surprise you, having served almost half of my military career oversees, that I am a proponent for our military being engaged overseas. I think that that ounce of provision is worth a whole lot more than the cure if we let the Peninsula go. The investment that we make by having a fairly modest force forward to keep peace on the Peninsula is absolutely worth it. And you're going to hear this again as we talk about forces in other places around the world. SANDY WINNEFELD:Now this is going to be a tough fight, if it ever actually happens, a conventional fight on a peninsula. We have the tyranny of distance. Yes, we have sort of 'Fight Tonight' ethos on the peninsula. But how do you see this unfolding? Are we going to be able to stop the North Korean hoards with Seoul right on the border of\u2014 GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:So, it's a great question. And really, some of those dynamics haven't changed for 20-plus years. The fact that North Korea can range the capital in that incredibly dense population, in the general Seoul area, can range it with dumb conventional firepower from the back side of the Kaesong Heights, at any moment's notice, it's a tough problem. And how do you shut that down as a force in the South? This will be a fight that the world hasn't seen in a long time. And the loss of life, both civilian and conventional military on the ground, we are not ready for that, I think, in this world. SANDY WINNEFELD:Yes, it's going to be tough to get our forces there in time to make a difference. It's\u2014 GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Absolutely. SANDY WINNEFELD:--going to be something that nobody can really accurately predict.\u00a0 Phil, we were just talking about Korea and Kim Jong-un and nuclear weapons. What do you think is the greatest impediment to him actually giving up those weapons? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:So, Sandy, I think it doesn't take a lot of looking into history to see what has happened to every despotic leader that has given up or had his nuclear weapons taken from them, to realize that the leaders in the North see this as their guarantee. And I think one of the toughest things in my tour as the SACEUR, is what happened in Ukraine. Here, Ukraine in the early '90s had an agreement with four signatory nations, that if they gave up their nuclear weapons that their territorial integrity and sovereignty would be guaranteed by those nations. And so they gave up their nuclear weapons. SANDY WINNEFELD:And look\u2014 GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:And what happened? SANDY WINNEFELD:--what happened. GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:One of the signatories invaded them. And two of the other signatories did nothing about it. SANDY WINNEFELD:Well, and that's to say nothing of Libya and, of course, Iraq. Phil, speaking of Asia, many view China as our most capable potential adversary. They've been closing previously existing gaps in conventional capability and opening new ones in asymmetrical capability. This is making life very difficult for the Pacific Command Commander, as you might imagine. Do you think we can keep pace with the Chinese through only improvements in our capability? And if so, where do you see that heading? What kind of capabilities do we need in order to keep an advantage out there? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Actually, I don't think that's the right way to go. I've heard you talk about this. And I happen to agree with some of the thoughts you have about, we get locked into certain things. The ends aren't changing, so we have ways and means. We typically focus on those means because they are what we do as an industrial nation here in America. And I think that changing the ways may be the end tack we have to take. The bottom line is, China is very good at setting goals and sticking to those goals, investing. And they're really pushing ahead in some of these critical technologies that are going to challenge us. And if all we are going to do is just buy more of the same to try to address it, I think we're going to be on the losing end of that cost curve. Just like we applied that to Russia in its past, I think China's putting us on the wrong side of that cost curve now. SANDY WINNEFELD:So you, I think, have a clear feel that just buying more stuff is not going to do the trick. There's sort of an intermediate step, maybe, between having to rethink the whole strategic challenge out there. And that is better stuff. Is there anything out there, any kind of breakthrough that could give us an advantage? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Yes, let me back up just a tiny bit. So we do have to fix readiness. The force needs to fix readiness. And some of that fixing readiness is investing in some of those capabilities that we need. So, I don't want to say we don't need to buy anything and we need to flip this, because we do. We've got to recapitalize some fleets that have been rode hard and put up wet in all of our services. But in the meantime, I think that if all our imagination is captured in doing more of the same, we will lose in this proposition against China. We have to think about changing the cost curve in more than money, imposing on them issues and problems that they have to deal with like they're imposing on us. And so I do believe that we need to be thinking about new technologies of defense. We need to be thinking about the kind of technology that allows us to strike with precision at range and not cost us an arm and a leg to do it. SANDY WINNEFELD:So Phil, let's drill in a little bit more, beyond now the capacity piece and the technical capability piece. If we actually bump up against the wall here and we have to think of a whole new strategic concept for China, do you have a sense for what that might look like? Is it about changing our ends and lowering our ambition in the Western Pacific? Or it's some different thing we can do that would present China with the dilemmas we've talked about? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:So, I don't know that it's all that easy to just change our ends. Our world and our societies expect certain things-- free passageway in the commons, free trade, etcetera, etcetera. And so I'm not sure that we are capable as a nation of really drastically changing the ends. And as I said before, if all we're going to do is look at means, I think that we are going to be in-- on the back side of a real problem here. So, I do believe we have to look at different ways. And I think that they are at risk in-- if we do-- if we hold them at risk inside their mainland. Right now we are not thinking about attacking the mainland, because this is a nuclear power. And frankly, they have done a pretty good job at holding us at bay and putting us at risk. But if we make them understand, through our investments and our new types of thinking about how to address this problem, that they are at risk in their homeland, I think it will change the calculus a bit. SANDY WINNEFELD:So let's turn to your most recent work, where you served last in the military. And you're we'll known for your views on Vladimir Putin and Russia. You've been very outspoken on that. What do you think is motivating the Russian leader? And what do you see as the trajectory of our relationship with Russia, Phil? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:So, none of this will be terribly now because my views haven't changed. But let's just recoup. So, first of all, I think Mr. Putin is a man who has grown up a proud Russian. He grew up in the KGB. He did not like the way the Cold War ended. He felt like that Russia was not at the table when the post-Cold War order was sort of set. And he felt like Russia was snubbed and should've been at the table. And he's determined to get Russia back at the table on determining the path of Europe as well as other parts of the world, as we see now in Syria and in North Africa. And frankly, it's a bit tough to say. But remember, this is a kleptocrat. You know, Mr. Putin has never been paid officially more than an army or air force lieutenant colonel. He's been a public servant all his life. And yet he's one of the richest men in the world. This is a kleptocrat who has been extracting wealth from that nation and he doesn't want to lose that wealth stream. So I think you've got on one side, a proud Russian that believes Russia was snubbed and should be a major power. And on the other side, there's a man that really likes the stream of money that comes from his position. SANDY WINNEFELD:Phil, to continue our discussion, I asked you about the trajectory of our relationship with Russia. Where do you see that heading? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:It's not good. If I was to imagine being in the room, having a cognac with Mr. Putin at this point, I would think he would be a very happy man. What he wants when he looks to his west is an E.U. that is fractured and disorganized, a NATO that is fractured and disorganized. He wants to deal with individual nations, individually, on individual security and business matters. And I think that right now he's succeeding. Let's just look at the state of conversation in NATO. Let's look at the state of conversation in Brexit and E.U., etcetera, etcetera. And so I think that right now what we see from Mr. Putin is unlikely to change, because in his mind, I believe, he sees his path as working. SANDY WINNEFELD:Well, and that's to say nothing of his interference in our elections. And it seems to me that he's not necessarily favoring a single candidate. He just wants to see chaos his way. GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Exactly. And I think that's a point that this particular city we're sitting in, seems to gloss over. Everybody wants to make this an election issue on one side or the other. And I couldn't agree with you more. What he wants is chaos. He wants to drag Western democracy down to the level of Russian democracy. And, of course, in some ways, he's having some success there. SANDY WINNEFELD:Yes, which helps him set the expectations of his own people. Now Phil, you had a Russian counterpart, a very interesting guy, Valery Gerasimov, who's the chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces. He's very active, to say the least, and has very strongly-held views on the competition between Russia and NATO. Can you tell us a bit about your relationship with him and how you perceive his views? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Let me just first start with, this is an intelligent man, a thinking man. And I believe he does a lot of his own writing-- maybe not the final products, but you can see what he thinks reflected in his speeches and his writing. So this is a learning, adaptive leader. And I think we need to respect him for that. I started off trying to build a relationship with him. And he and I began meeting on a series of video teleconferences and so forth. But sadly, I won't argue with why, but sadly when the Russians invaded Crimea and then when they went in and invaded Donbass and set up the radicals there, the SACEUR, first, was told, no longer to speak to Mr. Gerasimov. And then the U.S. European Command commander was also told to stop conversations with Mr. Gerasimov. SANDY WINNEFELD:And I'd draw a contrast there, not to interrupt, that when Russia invaded Georgia, the only contact between our two governments was between the chief of the general staff, Makarov, and Admiral Mike Mullen. GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:I must tell you that --it's-- you're right, and that was right, in my opinion. I believe when conflict is happening, you step up your conversation. You don't shut it off. And I had offered my opinion about what we should do, but I was given direction from my leadership. And I followed that direction. SANDY WINNEFELD:Well, and look what's happened. So, now looking at the big picture, end of the Cold War, the declaration of a peace dividend, do you think we went too far in drawing down from Europe? How do you feel about the ability now of the alliance to respond to Russian aggression? And let's start with how it might actually start and how you see it playing out and our ability to carry the day? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:So, I do believe we overcorrected. All of us, all the nations of NATO and our partner nations as well, we all took big peace dividends. And we in the U.S. removed so much capability from Europe. We don't have time to describe how big we were when Captain Phil Breedlove was in 2nd Brigade 3rd Infantry Division, standing with the Army as a TACP or an ALO in the early '80s. SANDY WINNEFELD:That's an air liaison officer for\u2014 GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:The early--\t(OVERTALK) SANDY WINNEFELD:--the un-anointed. GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Yes, so a forward air controller, Army associated. And so I think we have overreacted. And now we are having to sort of rethink about how we can do that. But again, not only did we withdraw our troops from Europe, but we downsized all of our militaries. And probably more damaging-- you could speak better to the Navy-- but probably more damaging, we have put such a strain on the military that we have, that our readiness is well below where it was when we faced the Soviet Union across the border. So I do believe that we have correction that needs to be made. SANDY WINNEFELD:So let's drill a little bit more deeply into that. What do you see as the advantages, operational military advantages that Russia has if they decide to get a little feisty vis-\u00e0-vis the NATO alliance? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:So the NATO alliance is on their backdoor. And it's a whole other subject to talk about the encroachment. But some of the nations that used to be Warsaw Pact are now NATO alliance members. And so if you remember Jomini, that great thinker, he talked about interior lines. Russia has the ability to quickly move and mass their forces, where NATO has to respond to the area. And I know you understand this better than most because of your naval background, but in the Cold War we almost took-- we fought to maintain the lines of contact with the East Coast of America and Europe. During the post-Cold War days, we have all but stopped worrying about fighting our way across the Atlantic. In fact, we assume safe passage across the Atlantic. And that's not the case anymore. And so Russia enjoys that ability to rapidly bring forces together. And if you've ever looked at Moscow and the spider network of roads and railroads from there, you understand how quickly they can do this. And then you have to look at what NATO has to do to respond. It's a physics problem. SANDY WINNEFELD:And that's not to mention a singularity of command and control\u2014 GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Absolutely. SANDY WINNEFELD:--twenty-eight nations having to decide versus one, and some of the advantages they have in artillery and tactical air defenses and the like. So do you see the need, as we talked about with China, for a new way? Or is it just sort of, \"Get the stuff back over there so that we can be more prepared?\" GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:The answer is yes. It's a little bit of all of that. So I think that we, again, have to address our readiness. We and our -- primarily or as well our allies -- need to bring forces to capability and readiness. And yes, we need to look a little bit about, \"Do we have the appropriate forces over there?\" Frankly, I don't believe we'll ever permanently move another force to Europe. But we need to settle ourselves in a way with prepositioning and other tactics, to be able to rapidly reinforce. And then, as you know, we're-- with the 2nd Fleet, we're starting to now rethink how we defend our sea lines of contact with America. But as we talked about with China, we've got to think about different ways. It just can't be means anymore. We've got to change the paradigm a little bit in Europe. SANDY WINNEFELD:As one of the most important organizations that was put into place in the wake of World War II, with the intent of preventing such large wars from ever happening again, was NATO. And our relationship with NATO has always been up and down. Where do you see it now? How do you see President Trump's influence on\u2014 GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Uh-huh (AFFIRM). SANDY WINNEFELD:--that relationship? How do you feel about your old buddies back in Europe? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:So, it's an interesting story. And as people sort of pick at me about this, I remind them that we were thrown out of a NATO country once, literally thrown out. And so yes, we've had some peaks and valleys in our relationship with NATO. I would tell you that I have watched every one of the last three presidents try to get NATO to invest more in itself. And while you and I may not agree with the tactics, techniques and procedures used, we actually now have NATO allies reinvesting in themselves. It's been a bit of a rocky road. And we'll just leave it at that. SANDY WINNEFELD:So it may be that we don't necessarily like the tone, but the result seems to be maybe in a direction we want.\u00a0 Phil, much has been made of the fact that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, expires in 2021. The U.S. withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in August 2019 because Russia failed to return to full and verified compliance through the destruction of its non-compliant missile system. Was pulling out of that treaty the right thing to do? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:So this is now just my opinion. You got it right. We were the only one in the treaty. It's kind of hard to have a treaty with yourself. Russia had abrogated the treaty. So the question is, how do you move forward? How do you try to re-engage Russia? The choice was to back out of the INF. If it had been me making that decision, I think I'd have done it differently. I would've tried to build from an existing treaty. I just think it's easier to do that than to renegotiate entirely a new treaty. But let me throw one more curve ball into this calculus. And that is that we really need to have a treaty with more than just Russia. And it would be incredibly hard, but to get China into a treaty as well, because they are going to be an issue. And frankly, right now, I think Russia has more issues with China's capabilities than with ours, because we really don't have any in Europe right now. SANDY WINNEFELD:It could be one of the reasons why they violated the treaty, right, because they're more worried\u2014 GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Absolutely. SANDY WINNEFELD:--about China. GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:We have to be intellectually honest. SANDY WINNEFELD:How do you feel about the Russian assertion that the missile defense system that's in Romania, which is a AEGIS system that not only can carry the SM-3 missile that's a ballistic missile defense thing, but could also theoretically carry the Tomahawk Missile and therefore we were also in violation of the INF treaty. What's your take on that? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:I think that's a convenient excuse for the Russian Federation to offer. I think it's hogwash. SANDY WINNEFELD:So, the Russians have been developing some pretty exotic new strategic weapons, right? Nuclear cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons and even big transoceanic nuclear torpedoes, as we saw the strategic glance over Vladimir Putin's soldier looking-- or shoulder looking at a Power Point slide. But they've also talked about extending the START treaty. That almost seems to be at odds with each other. What do you see the trajectory of strategic arms control agreements with Russia? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:I will offer you my hope. I think we need to stay in the START. I think we need to grow from that to a new round of understandings. I think we need to wrap China into these conversations and try to bring that dynamic in. And I think we need to back in now and get a new INF-like treaty, even if it's only with Russia, but it would hopefully be with China. And I think that we want to do everything we can to slow this race to expanding the nuclear countries of the world. SANDY WINNEFELD:So, one of the things that's always been a thorn in Russia's side in terms of arms control agreements, is ballistic missile defense. They firmly believe that our development-- or at least they say they believe that our development of ballistic missile defense was designed to negate their ability to respond to an attack, and therefore we would-- it would create strategic instability. Phil, do you think that they actually believe this? Or do you think they're using it as a convenient foil to try to just get us to get rid of ballistic missile defense? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:I think it's the latter. We all know that Russia has the ability to overwhelm our defenses. The only thing that a small defense that we have, if it's credible-- and I think ours is-- and gets more credible every day, the only thing that does is sort of take away the coercive value of small attacks to be-- to force us to think differently as we talk and negotiate with Russia. But we can't build enough missiles to stop their attack. And frankly, I think they're more worried about our decapitation of their ability to launch an attack than they are about our missile defense. I think it's, again, a sort of convenient tool to try to shape us at the negotiating table. SANDY WINNEFELD:Now Phil, the realization that I came to in the last couple years I was on active-duty, that our space command and control capability was a bit weak, was a very unforgettable moment for me. That's getting a lot better. The Department has tried to reorganize itself for space. As a career Air Force officer, can you give me a sense for what your thoughts are on the new space force? Getting beyond the grief, they've taken over logos and uniforms\u2014 GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Right, right. SANDY WINNEFELD:--and the like. Do you think that the Department's headed down a wise path here? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:I think we're on a path. And we're going to make it as wise as we can. I love the way that our current chief of Staff sort of said it a few years ago. He said, \"We are currently an Air and Space Force. In 40 years, we're going to be a Space and Air Force.\" We in this service, absolutely accept and acknowledge that that transition's going to happen. The real key here then is, how fast does that happen? It matters not now. The decision was to move out. And so I think you're going to see everybody that wears a blue uniform embrace that and move out. And I'm actually happy about that. What I think we need to understand is, that since we have done this so abruptly and so suddenly, we've got some problems to take care of. And one of them starts with people, or in the commercial world the H.R. business, of the Air Force. How do we manage these people that were formerly Air Force and dutifully became missileers because we told them they had to be missileers to get promoted. And now we've got this mixture of people that aren't purely space, some of them missileers. How do we not damage those highly-valued members of our services as we do this really abruptly into the future? And so I embrace and am proud for the fact that we're going to create a space force. I don't want to leave dead and broken bodies along the way as we do that. And so we need to do it quickly. I believe in Star Wars. There are going to be X-wing fighters. I hope my grandchildren are flying them sometime in the future. SANDY WINNEFELD:That sounds like fun. Maybe we were born too early. GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:That's right. SANDY WINNEFELD:So Phil, you-- I have just a little bit of time left. I've known you a long, long time. GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Yes. SANDY WINNEFELD:You've had a fantastic career. You're one of the most highly regarded officers, let alone Air Force officers, that I know. Can you give me a sense for what the most valuable or the most rewarding part of your career was, whether it's NATO or your time in a blue uniform? What was the best part for you? GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:So, it changed, Sandy. I think you and I both agree, when we were ensigns and lieutenants and captains and majors and commanders, all I wanted to do is fly that F-16. I wanted to be the most effective, efficient killing machine out there. I wanted to be right for my nation. And then along the way, I was asked to command. I commanded at a very small level in the Army. I commanded a squadron, a group, three fighter wings, a numbered air force, a MAJCOM and an alliance. And I will tell you that the most rewarding part of my career was working with the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines that I got to command along the way. It is absolutely incredibly -- it is our number one resource -- are those soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. And I would just tell you that even though I loved flying the F-16, being able to lead troops was a big deal to me. SANDY WINNEFELD:Well, and that's a great way to end. You have been listening to Intelligence Matters, hosted by Michael Morell. I'm your guest host, Sandy Winnefeld. And our guest has been General Phil Breedlove, former NATO supreme allied commander of Europe. Phil, thanks so much for spending time with our listeners today. It's been a great discussion. GEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:Thanks, Sandy.\t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "Suddenly, crisis management is an urgent issue in the presidential campaign. Coronavirus has infected world financial markets. And now, Wall Street is calculating the chances of a recession. Into this, a new name will appear on primary ballots for the first time. Michael Bloomberg, the 78-year-old billionaire and former mayor of New York City, skipped the early contests. But he's already spent almost $500 million, much of it aimed at this week's Super Tuesday. We spoke to Mike Bloomberg Saturday, and earlier in the week, about how he would lead, his reputation with women and minorities and the virus crisis. Scott Pelley: How do you view this emergency? Mike Bloomberg: I find it incomprehensible that the president would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did [Friday] night in South Carolina. Scott Pelley: He said that the Democrats making so much of it is a Democratic hoax, not that the virus was a hoax. Mike Bloomberg: This is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. And it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, \"We don't know, but we have to prepare for the fact that, if it is, we have the medicines and the structure and the knowledge to deal with it.\" Scott Pelley: The president's proposed budget would have cut 16% from the budget of the Centers for Disease Control, and about 8% from the National Institutes of Health. Mike Bloomberg: I would have raised it rather than cut it. Scott Pelley: I should say that the Congress didn't allow that to happen, so the cuts didn't happen. But what do you make of the effort to cut those budgets? Mike Bloomberg: We have to spend money to make us safe and protect this country. It's like saying I'm not going to fund the military. \"I'm not gonna fund the local fire department. We're not gonna have fires. I don't believe-- fires are hoaxes.\" This is about the level that he's talking. Spending money is what the Trump administration has in mind now. It's asking for nearly $2 billion for a virus response led by the vice president. Despite that, markets plummeted about 10% last week. Scott Pelley: What about Wall Street? Mike Bloomberg: Wall Street does not do well with uncertainty. And it's-- the worst thing is nobody knows how bad this is going to get. I can just tell you, in my company, we're splitting in all our big offices into two different buildings, even if it's just a temporary thing. If this flu does strike, and strikes our employees, it won't strike all of them, because we have to continue to provide a service. Scott Pelley: Friday evening, the president announced his selection for director of National Intelligence. His principal qualification for that job appears to be fierce loyalty to the president. Mike Bloomberg: That's all of the president's appointees, have that one characteristic. Scott Pelley: And I'm curious, how would you fill the top jobs in government? Mike Bloomberg: Plain and simple: You get some experts. You put 'em in a room and say, \"Okay, now who should we go hire to do this job? Who's the best person in the world?\" We'll start there. Asking what party they're a member of, how they voted the last time, it is so nonsensical. If you are sick, do you really wanna go to a doctor who was politically correct? Or somebody that knew how to treat your disease? I'll rest my case. Bloomberg is pressing his case after a late start and poor showing in his first debate last month. This past Wednesday, after a better, second debate, he slept three hours before heading to his Times Square headquarters to phone voters. He's opened more than 200 offices with 2,400 staff.\u00a0 That same morning, he met us for a flight to his boyhood home.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: You told everybody who would listen that you're not running for president. Mike Bloomberg: I did. Scott Pelley: What changed? Mike Bloomberg: I started watching and listening to the candidates. And they had ideas that made no sense to me whatsoever. Donald Trump is gonna eat 'em for lunch. That evening he would head to South Carolina and Texas. Bloomberg comes to politics like the electrical engineer he is, pragmatic not charismatic.\u00a0Mike Bloomberg: I have been training for this job for close to 20 years there is nobody else running that has any management experience whatsoever in any of these things, but you have to have somebody that's been there done that and will do it right and will guide us through the tough times particularly day one. Scott Pelley: What does the data today tell you about the voter that leads you to believe that you can win? Mike Bloomberg: A few years ago there was a revolution against the intelligentsia. People said, \"You know, those people, particularly on the coasts, are trying to tell us what to do.\" They wanted a change. That explains Donald Trump. Now, people seem to have changed. This cycle, people want stability. His political career began in 2001. He won the mayor's office three times as a Republican, then once as an independent. His strategy was the one he is using right now: he massively outspent his opponents in self-funded campaigns. In 12 years, Bloomberg helped rebuild Ground Zero, helped the city survive the Great Recession. He banned smoking in restaurants, improved schools and balanced the budget. But there was controversy. Bloomberg expanded a police tactic called stop and frisk. More than 80% of those stopped were minorities. Less than 1% were carrying guns.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: You defended stop and frisk right up to the point that you announced you were going to run for president. What have you learned? Mike Bloomberg: We should've, in retrospect, been more careful and keep it from-- and keep the numbers from growing and we did not and for that I am very sorry. Scott Pelley: It was a mistake, the way that it rolled out-- Mike Bloomberg: Well, yeah, there's no argument about it. It was a mistake. I erred. It was a mistake. I've took-- I haven't walked away from my responsibility for it.\u00a0 Bloomberg is divorced with two daughters and two grandchildren. He still owns his boyhood home in Medford, Massachusetts. Scott Pelley: Your parents bought this house through an intermediary because the owner wouldn't sell to a Jew. Mike Bloomberg: Correct. 1946, and the guy who sold it to us said his sister would never forgive him. Scott Pelley: Do you think America's ready for a Jewish president? Mike Bloomberg: Nobody's-- virtually nobody's mentioned it and I think in this day and age, yes. We've moved on. It's a better world than it was back then. Mike Bloomberg is the ninth richest person in the world, worth about $60 billion. His success began in 1981. Before PC's or the internet evolved, Bloomberg created a data and communications network for Wall Street. Today, the Bloomberg Terminal is the central nervous system of world finance. But he told us, if he wins the presidency, he'll sell the company. Scott Pelley: What does a multibillionaire know about people who are living paycheck to paycheck and hoping that the car doesn't break down? Mike Bloomberg: When I lived in this house my father made $6,000 the best year of his life. My parents took a mortgage out on the house, I think it was $11,000, if I remember, to help my sister and I go through school. I worked as hard as anybody. Not better. I wasn't any better or worse, I was luckier, I think than other people. He has 20,000 employees. But in early years, some found the office harsh. Allegations by women have challenged his political campaigns.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: In 1990, as a tongue-in-cheek gift, your employees immortalized some of your sayings, in a booklet called, \"The Wit and Wisdom of Michael Bloomberg.\" Mike Bloomberg: I don't think I ever saw the book, but I do remember it. Scott Pelley: One of them has you describing your Bloomberg Terminal, and the quote in the book is, quoting you, \"It will do everything, including give you,\" a euphemism for oral sex-- Mike Bloomberg: Right, okay. Scott Pelley: \"I guess that puts a lot of you girls out of business.\" Mike Bloomberg: Well, I didn't write the book. So-- Scott Pelley: Did you say these things? Mike Bloomberg: I don't remember saying it. I can tell you that years ago on the trading room floors, things were different. I apologize for that, I'm sorry if somebody was hurt. Scott Pelley: You don't remember. Mike Bloomberg: If I annoyed somebody or hurt somebody I apologize. I can't go rewrite history. I can only tell you now it is a different world. Scott Pelley: It's a different world, but the question is, is it a different man? Mike Bloomberg: Oh, I think, for sure. You evolve with times. We're all a product of the world we live in. Shame on you if you don't learn and try to be better. Bloomberg was named in lawsuits three times in the 1990's by female employees offended by his alleged comments. One suit was settled, two were dismissed. \u00a0 Scott Pelley: How can you be the standard-bearer for a party that claims the high ground on the rights of women and minorities? Mike Bloomberg: Because I brought down the murder rate. I doubled the, or cut the gap between rich and poor education. I created 500,000 jobs, 175,000 units of affordable housing. We did all the things to reduce poverty that anybody could possibly do. And when I left, I think it's fair to say most people, women, minorities, they would say it was the best 12 years the city has had in modern memory. Since leaving City Hall, Bloomberg has been giving away his fortune. He has donated billions to reduce gun violence, smoking, and greenhouse gases. He spent more than $100 million helping Democrats in 2018 when they retook the house. He's telling voters he would expand Obamacare while keeping employer-provided insurance. And provide eventual citizenship to the 11 million residents who immigrated illegally. He's for control of the borders but doesn't think a wall will do it.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: Who's gonna get a tax increase-- Mike Bloomberg: The wealthy. Scott Pelley: --in your administration, and who's gonna get a tax cut Mike Bloomberg: We're gonna have to raise taxes on me and people like me. He means a 5% surtax on household incomes over $5 million and a roll back of President Trump's 2017 cuts for the wealthy. Scott Pelley: You have already spent twice as much on this campaign as President Trump has raised. How much are you willing to spend? Mike Bloomberg: Well, I'm making an investment in this country. My investment is I'm going to remove President Trump from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or at least try as hard as I can. Scott Pelley: So it's a blank check? You'd spend $1 billion? Mike Bloomberg: Well, I don't know if it's a blank check, but, when they come to me and they wanna spend more, I've so far said yes. He said 'yes' to starting a new company to analyze voter data for targeting ads and social media. This was President Trump's big advantage in 2016 and Bloomberg is spending heavily to catch up. Scott Pelley: If you're not the nominee, will you support the nominee of the party? Mike Bloomberg: it's an easy commitment for me to make because the alternative is Donald Trump, so yes, I would support the nominee-- Scott Pelley: If you don't finish in the top three on Super Tuesday is that it for you? Mike Bloomberg: No, of course not. Scott Pelley: You'll keep going. Mike Bloomberg: Yeah, sure. There's an election seven or so days later. There's another one 14 days later. There's a number of elections after that. Despite Joe Biden's win yesterday in South Carolina, Bloomberg believes Bernie Sanders is the candidate to beat. He's counting on voters to move toward a centrist who believes government should be effective and dull, not a blood sport for tv. Mike Bloomberg: The middle of the road doesn't want extremism. They want evolution rather than revolution. And if Bernie Sanders is the candidate, Donald Trump will win. Donald Trump not only will win, but the House will go back to being in Republican hands, the Senate will stay in Republican hands. Downstream, a lotta the state houses will flip back Republican. And when that happens, you're gonna have gerrymandering at the local level and judicial appointments at the federal level that will last for decades. And so, what's really at stake here is the future of this country for a very long time. And that's why I'm running. Produced by Maria Gavrilovic. Associate producer, Alex Ortiz.

            "article_content": "On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click\u00a0here\u00a0to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington and this week on FACE THE NATION, the coronavirus has now claimed the life of an American within the U.S. and the number of infected has increased and now includes cases of unknown origin. Meanwhile, the Trump administration scrambles to calm fears of Americans concerned with the spread of coronavirus and its impact on the economy as the stock market has its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Plus, it's a big win for former Vice President Joe Biden in South Carolina. As the candidates head to Super Tuesday, can he stop Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders? JOE BIDEN: We are very much alive. MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Vice President Joe Biden won South Carolina and won it big. JOE BIDEN: You launched Bill Clinton, Barack Obama to the presidency. Now you launched our campaign on the path to defeating Donald Trump. This campaign has taken off. MARGARET BRENNAN: With fourteen states up for grabs in just two days, Biden's victory gives a boost to establishment Democrats hoping to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: There are a lot of states in this country. Nobody wins them all. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders about the race. Plus, as the coronavirus crisis prompts questions of whether or not the U.S. is ready to handle a pandemic, the politics of preparedness becomes a big issue. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think it's inevitable. It probably will. It possibly will. MARGARET BRENNAN: Now the Trump administration faces a crisis of its own: Calming and reassuring the American public. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are preparing for the worst. We are ready. We are ready. This is no reason to panic. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's been a rough week of mixed messages and attacks on familiar targets. MICK MULVANEY: The press was-- was-- was-- was-- was-- was covering their-- their hoax of the day because they thought it would bring down the President. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. This is their new hoax. MARGARET BRENNAN: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb will both be here. Then the Trump administration signs a peace deal with the Taliban to end the war in Afghanistan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is just back from that signing ceremony with the Taliban, and we will talk to him. All that and more is just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It was a knockout win for former Vice President Joe Biden last night in the South Carolina primary. He got nearly half the vote coming in close to thirty points ahead over his closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders. CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto is here to tell us more. So, Anthony, how did Joe Biden do this? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret. Big keys for him. First of all, overwhelming support from black voters. That was key and they make up most of the electorate in South Carolina. That was really helped by an endorsement from Representative Jim Clyburn, the most influential African-American politician in the state, more saying that was important than not. And then, finally, big support among those looking for electability that somebody they feel can go on to beat Donald Trump in November. The question now, Margaret, is can Joe Biden parlay that argument into Super Tuesday? MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll get details and forecasts from you on Super Tuesday ahead, Anthony. We turn now to Senator Bernie Sanders. He is on the campaign trail in Norfolk, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont/@BernieSanders/Democratic Presidential Candidate): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this now a two-man race? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, all I can say is we have won the popular vote in Iowa. We won the New Hampshire primary. We won the Nevada caucus. We lost last night. We're looking forward to Super Tuesday. I think we got a great chance to win in California, in Texas, in Massachusetts, and a number of states around the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: South Carolina is the first southern state. Does that indicate anything to you about your prospects in places like Virginia and-- and North Carolina? Will Joe Biden really challenge you there? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, we're going to see. I mean I think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in Virginia. I think we got a shot in North Carolina. All I can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. Those are ideas, Margaret, that I think are resonating all across this country. I think we have an excellent chance to do well on Tuesday and to win the Democratic nomination. MARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. We know from your campaign that you raised forty-six million dollars in February. That's a significant number. What do you think that does for you going into Super Tuesday? What edge? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, Margaret, it is not only-- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. We don't have a Super PAC like Joe Biden. I don't go to rich people's homes like Joe Biden. I think Joe has contributions from more than forty billionaires. What we have done is receive more campaign contributions from more Americans than any candidate in the history of the United States, averaging eighteen dollars and fifty cents. This is a campaign of working people and by working people. And I'm extraordinarily proud of that. But we have enough money now not only to take us through Super Tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working-class people all across this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your campaign said that if you are the nominee, you won't accept the financial help that Michael Bloomberg has offered. He said he'd extend it to any party nominee. Do you really want to turn down his bankroll? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, Mister Bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his sixty billion dollars and that's legal. All I can say is at this point we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working-class and middle-class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. Look, one of the things that upsets people-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would accept it? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --whether conservative or progressive, is-- I didn't say that. What I would say-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --is that he has the right to do anything he wants. Right now, we are confident, Margaret, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are a Democratic socialist. You have never officially entered the Democratic Party. In fact, you constantly criticize Democratic establishment. So, how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify Democrats and challenge President Trump? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, two points. I am a member of the Democratic leadership. I have been in the Democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in Congress thirty years ago and from-- in the state of Vermont, where I live, I am supported by Democrats that have won the Democratic primary. But we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to Democrats, and to more than a few Republicans. Look, we are living at a time when the American people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in America. All over this country, Margaret, and I have been all over this country, you got millions of people who work eleven, twelve bucks an hour. They can't afford childcare. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: They can't afford health care. They are scared to death about their retirement. They want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. That's how you win. You put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. That is what we're doing. No campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. That's how you beat Trump. And, by the way, almost all of the national polls out there, you know, I've had last seventy polls, sixty-five of them, I think, have us beating Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We're beating them in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. We can beat Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have rallies planned out in California. There is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the West Coast. Is it safe for you? Have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, actually, we have. I mean that's a very fair question. And my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. And right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in California, but in Utah, Minnesota, and other states around the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been sparring with the pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC. You said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at Prime Minister Netanyahu. Today, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. says of you that you're not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool, or both. Do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-Israel lobby in this way? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I mean they have a lot of money. They have a lot of power. Look, I'm Jewish and I'm very proud of my Jewish heritage. As a kid I spent time in Israel. I am not in-- anti-Israel. I will do everything I can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the Israeli people. But what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects Israel but deals with the suffering of the Palestinian people as well. You got seventy percent youth unemployment in Gaza. People can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. It is not sustainable that we-- continued conflict in the Middle East until the United States develops an even-handed policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: So, I am pro-Israel; I am pro-Palestinian. I want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you on foreign policy. The President just authorized a deal with the Taliban. What do you think of that? Because if you're commander in chief, you'd either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of U.S. troops. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I don't have enough details and the-- and that peace agreement, needless to say, is going to have to go through the Afghan government. We don't know what's going to happen. One of the difficulties, to be very honest, Margaret, in dealing with Trump, it is very hard to believe anything that he says, whether it's the coronavirus, whether what's going on in Afghanistan. But it is my view that the United States and I-- I speak of somebody help lead the opposition to getting us into the war in Iraq. It is my view that we got to end endless wars, that when we have five hundred thousand people in America sleeping out on the street and people can't afford health care-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --we got to invest in this country, not in endless wars. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Sanders, thank you for joining us. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has not yet appeared on a ballot, but that will change Tuesday. He sat down with our Scott Pelley yesterday in an interview for tonight's 60 MINUTES. Here's a preview. (Begin VT) SCOTT PELLEY (60 MINUTES): How do you view this emergency? MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (60 MINUTES): I find it incomprehensible that the President would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did last night in South Carolina. SCOTT PELLEY: He-- he said the-- the Democrats making so much of it is a Democratic hoax, not that the virus was a hoax. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: This is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. They all around the world say that it is in some places and has enormous potential to become one elsewhere. And it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, we don't know, but we have to prepare for the fact that if it is, we have the medicines and the structure, and the knowledge to deal with it. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott's interview with Mayor Bloomberg will air tonight on 60 MINUTES. FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look at the growing fears over COVID-19, commonly referred to as the coronavirus. Last week the World Health Organization said the global risk of the virus spreading is now very high. Here in the U.S., there are now seventy-one cases of coronavirus and worldwide the death toll is almost three thousand. There are also concerns about the global economy. Here in the U.S., the stock market took its biggest hit last week since the 2008 financial crisis. We begin today with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Good to have you here. ALEX AZAR (Secretary of Health and Human Services/@SecAzar): Glad to be here. Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: So we just had the first American death on U.S. soil out in Washington State. What do we know about how the virus was contracted and how much it has spread? ALEX AZAR: So this individual and we just want to express our sympathy, certainly for his family and for all who are suffering from the coronavirus, this individual was in the hospital out in Calif-- out-- out in Washington. We do not know how he contracted the virus, yet. And so that's why we and the State of Washington are deployed out there to try to trace who he had contact with and how he might have gotten the virus. That's why we call it right now a potential community case, meaning we don't have a discernible connection to any travel to Korea or China or any other impacted area. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, at this point, you don't know if this person came into contact with anyone. He just showed up sick at the hospital? ALEX AZAR: We have no evidence so far that establishes a connection to somebody who traveled to an impacted area. And so we do not know how he contracted the virus. That's really what we do. That's the basic blocking and tackling right now of public health is we're going to trace the people that he had contact with. We're going to trace the other cases. There is a nursing home that sends patients to this hospital. And there are cases in that nursing home. But who spread to whom? We do not know yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: The President yesterday when he was speaking referred to this fatality as a woman. It is a man. ALEX AZAR: It-- yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: How is a mistake like that made? Because people are very nervous right now and getting some of these basic facts right affects public trust. ALEX AZAR: Well, I understand that. It's a very fast-moving situation. Our Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were up late at night, very earl-- early in the morning, working with the Washington state public health office and inaccurately recorded that the individual was a female. That's what the President was briefed on. They've apologized for incorrectly briefing on that. But it's a very fast-moving situation. Obviously, we regret the error. MARGARET BRENNAN: Given that it is so fast moving, what are your projections now? How many Americans do you expect to come down with this virus? ALEX AZAR: So what your viewers need to know is the risk to average Americans remains low. We are working to keep it low. We will see more transmission of cases in the United States. We've got the finest public health system in the world here. This is what we do. We cannot make predictions as to how many cases we'll have but we will have more and we will have more community cases. It's simply just a matter of math. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have to have a number you're working with in order to make sure that you have adequate supply, things like testing kits, right? So-- ALEX AZAR: We- we don't-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --how are we on shortages? You may not want to tell me the number, but you have one in your head-- ALEX AZAR: No we don't-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --you're using for planning. ALEX AZAR: No we don't. We- we don't-- we do not use-- because it is an unknown, the epidemiological spread of this virus in a highly developed health care system that was on it with-- at the most aggressive containment measures in the history of the United States. It is unknown how that will spread. In terms of testing kits, we've already tested over thirty-six hundred people for the virus. We now have seventy-- the capability in-- out-- in the field to test seventy-five thousand people. And within the next week or two we'll have a radical expansion even beyond that of the testing that's available. MARGARET BRENNAN: In Washington State, in places that have declared emergencies, even shutting down schools I mean they are projecting numbers themselves. ALEX AZAR: They might make projections of numbers themselves, but we are not. We'll take aggressive public health measures. It's what we call community mitigation steps. So depending on the nature of the disease and depending on what we learn from these in the field investigations-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ALEX AZAR: --the state and local government will take measures appropriate to contain the spread of the disease. MARGARET BRENNAN: So in France, they shut down the Louvre Museum. They're telling people, don't kiss, don't shake hands. In Japan, they're closing schools for a month. Canada's health minister told his people to start stockpiling food. In the U.S. there are closures, as we just said, in Washington and in Oregon. They've declared a state of emergency out there. And the CDC said this week, disruption to everyday life might be severe. ALEX AZAR: Might. Might. That's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? I mean Americans hear this and they are concerned. There's about a two-percent fatality rate. ALEX AZAR: And I-- I appreciate that people are concerned of that, and that-- that is why we're being radically transparent about what we know and also what the full range of potential scenarios could be. And that's why we say might be, but also might not be with aggressive containment and mitigation steps. Right now it's important for people to understand we're not advising any types of particular measures in the United States like travel restrictions or closures. State or local public health offices, which are the frontlines of response, might make their own decisions to do that. But, at this point, we do not have sufficient spread in the United States that would indicate those measures. But we're not taking any of them off the table. The full range of options will always remain on the table. MARGARET BRENNAN: In a crisis you need public trust. ALEX AZAR: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: An inspector general announced this week that they are looking into this complaint by a whistleblower that your agency did not provide adequate training or equipment to those workers who went to receive and welcome back Americans who had been evacuated from Wuhan, China. And those workers were not tested for the virus after they had that contact. Have you personally looked into these allegations? ALEX AZAR: Yes, we are-- we are looking into these allegations. I am personally involved in doing so. First-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So, can you say that this wasn't something that tipped off the spread on the West Coast? ALEX AZAR: That is absolutely not the case. So, first, we take the protection of our employees very seriously. Second, we want to make sure isolation and quarantine procedures are followed as appropriate. Third, we appreciate the whistleblower bringing forward any concerns. We are aggressively looking into any-- if-- to see whether there's validity to the concerns. But what the American people should need to know is that we now have passed well over fourteen days since any HHS employee had contact with the individuals involved. They are not-- nobody is symptomatic. Nobody has a disease. Even if these allegations prove to be true, there was no spreading of the disease from this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm. ALEX AZAR: And we have offered, even though it is not medically indicated, we have offered to test any HHS employees involved if they would like that extra piece of mind. We want to do that for our employees. MARGARET BRENNAN: There are cases of the coronavirus in Mexico and in Canada. Yesterday, the President said he is considering and looking at closing the southern border. ALEX AZAR: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What will decide that? Are you looking at that? ALEX AZAR: That's not one of the highest priority areas that we're looking at right now, because Mexico only has a couple of cases. Canada's epidemiology is similar to the United States right now. What the President's making clear, though, is we'll always be looking at travel restrictions, border protections. We will take whatever measures are appropriate and necessary to protect the American people. But we don't forecast doing that anytime soon. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect drug shortages, as some senators have highlighted concerns there could be because of disruption to the supply chain? ALEX AZAR: So, we're very concerned about the intermingling of our supply chain with China, in particular. We-- the FDA has gone out and worked proactively with drug manufacturers and there are twenty drugs for which the entire molecule or a critical element of the molecule is made exclusively in China. And so we're working aggressively with the-- with the manufacturers to determine if there are any shortages. We are aware of one drug which has many, many replacements in terms of that therapeutic class available that may be in shortage for a short period of time. But-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What drug is that? ALEX AZAR: --I'm not able to because it's commercially confidential information that's submitted voluntarily to us, I'm not able to discuss that. But this is a drug in a class where there are many, many, many alternatives available. It's a generic drug. Very available. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Mister Secretary, thank you for your time. And we will be right back with another cabinet official, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Yesterday, the U.S. signed a deal with the Taliban that may lead to a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Since it began in 2001, the war has claimed the lives of more than two thousand four hundred American troops. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is just back from the signing ceremony in Doha. He got off the plane just a short while ago. And thank you for being here, Mister Secretary. MIKE POMPEO (Secretary of State/@SecPompeo): Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is significant. And according to the deal that was released, the U.S. will bring down troops to eight thousand six hundred in the next hundred and thirty-five days. And then if conditions are met, a total withdrawal within fourteen months. But the President said yesterday, if bad things happen, we'll go back in. What's the benchmark there? MIKE POMPEO: Yes, Ma'am. This was a historic day. American blood and treasure have been expended in this place for an awfully long time. We went there after 9/11. No one still feels the anger of that day any more than I do. But it was time. And the Taliban knew it was time. President Trump has allowed us to take the fight to the Taliban these last two years. And we have done so. It's why they, for the first time, have announced that they're prepared to break with their historic ally, al-Qaida, who they've worked with much the det-- detriment of the United States of America. You can see, go read the document, the Taliban have now made the break. They've said they will not permit terror to be thrust upon anyone, including the United States, from Afghanistan. This is historic in that way and no one should underestimate the Trump administration. You can see our work on counterterror, whether it's al-Baghdadi, Qassem al-Rimi-- MARGARET BRENNAN: How long will it take-- MIKE POMPEO: --the work that we did against Qassem Soleimani. This is a President who is committed to defending and protecting the American people. We'll do that every place we battle against terror whether that's Afghanistan or any of the other dozens of places we push back each and every day. MARGARET BRENNAN: How long would it take to get U.S. troops out? Because you're saying this is based on conditions. That means the Taliban has to follow through on a few things. MIKE POMPEO: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: What would make the President hit the brakes and stop the withdrawal? MIKE POMPEO: Look, we can't get into hypotheticals about what it would take exactly but there is a detailed set of commitments that the Taliban have made about the levels of violence that can occur, the nature of what's got to take place. We are hopeful that in the coming days, there will be inter-Afghan negotiations that commence as well. That has not happened before. It's going to be rocky and bumpy. No one-- no one is under any false illusion that this won't be a difficult conversation. But that conversation for the first time in almost two decades will be among the Afghan people. And that's the appropriate place for that conversation to take place. We're-- we're prepared to do what it takes to ensure that we keep America safe. We've asked everyone there to reduce the levels of violence, both the Afghan national-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MIKE POMPEO: --security forces and the Taliban. MARGARET BRENNAN: But President Trump said he's going to meet with the Taliban in the near future. When? Where? Is that Camp David? MIKE POMPEO: I don't know when. I don't know where. I-- I'm very confident. President Trump wants to make sure that everyone in Afghanistan understands that the United States is committed to making sure that this conversation take place. We have been at this for an awful long time. You recounted the loss of American life. There's a better path forward. The Taliban now know this because of the work that we've done. And President Trump will be actively engaged in helping us get the conditions right and beginning this journey that the first step was taken in Doha yesterday. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break and continue the conversation on the other side of it. Please stay with us. We hope you will, too. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Pompeo is here for more on ending America's longest war, and then a look at politics and Super Tuesday. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. And we are continuing our conversation with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is just back in the U.S. after signing a deal with the Taliban in Doha. And-- and-- just that statement alone is kind of amazing. You were the first U.S. cabinet official to ever meet with a member of the Taliban. I think you actually met with one of the founding members of the Taliban who is involved in this. MIKE POMPEO: I met with a senior negotiator yesterday, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you called them terrorists in the past. Do you still consider the Taliban terrorists? MIKE POMPEO: They have an enormous amount of American blood on their hands. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, apparently, in a partnership still with al Qaeda? MIKE POMPEO: Yep, they said yesterday, signed a document. The gentleman whom I met with agreed that they would break that relationship and that they would work alongside of us to destroy, deny resources to and to have al Qaeda depart from that place. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that? MIKE POMPEO: Don't trust anything. We're going to deliver. It's about actions. The agreements that set out, the conditions that set out the space. But, no, this deal doesn't depend upon trusting anyone. It has a deep, complex, well-thought out, multi-month negotiated verification complex and mechanism by which we can observe and hold every member of the agreement accountable. We'll do that. It's not about trust. It's about what happens on the ground to not only yesterday, which was an important day, but in the days that follow. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. pledged in this agreement, which is public, as you say, that it will help to get up to five thousand Taliban prisoners released. The president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, says no way, no how. He-- nothing like that was agreed to. All of this is supposed to happen in the next ten days. Did the U.S. agree to help release five thousand prisoners? MIKE POMPEO: You saw what the document says. It says, we will work with all relevant-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So Ghani-- what he is saying is wrong? MIKE POMPEO: It says that we will work with all relevant parties to build on confidence, to create confidence-building measures amongst all of the parties, the Afghan government, non-Taliban, and others in the Afghan. We-- we want this to be an inclusive process. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a process-- MIKE POMPEO: We want-- we want women-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --this would be a spoiler in just-- MIKE POMPEO: We want-- we want-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --the first ten days. MIKE POMPEO: We want women to be involved. They-- there will be lots of people say things. There will be lots of noise. Everyone is competing for attention and time in the media. What matters is the actions that we take, the discussions that we had. We have come a long ways and we have worked not only yesterday. While I was in Doha, Secretary of Defense was in Kabul, along with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. They made a declaration. There was a commitment from the Afghan government, too. We've made a lot of progress. No one is under any illusion that this will be straightforward. We've built an important base where we can begin to bring American soldiers home, reduce the risk of the loss of life of any American in Afghanistan, and, hopefully, set the conditions so the Afghan people can build out a peaceful resolution to their, now what for them is a forty-year struggle. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, putting five thousand or up to five thousand fighters back on the field is, obviously-- would have a significant impact on-- on any of the implementation, one would think. So, are-- are-- MIKE POMPEO: So, there have been-- there-- there-- there have-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --do you expect this to actually happen? MIKE POMPEO: --there have been prisoner releases from both sides before. We have managed to figure our path forward. We'll know who these people are. We are working to build out a set of confidence measures that will do for America what President Trump has committed: reduce our cost in blood and treasure and keep America safe from terrorism. I don't think any American can doubt President Trump's seriousness in that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Liz Cheney, Republican, and about twenty allies-- MIKE POMPEO: Who I know well. MARGARET BRENNAN: --who you know well, wasn't very happy with you this week, though, because she released a public letter saying that there are problems with this, that you-- you-- you are pretending that the Taliban can be counterterrorism partners and saying, you know, the Taliban is still allied with al Qaeda and pointed out you personally when you were a member of Congress-- MIKE POMPEO: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --she suggested wouldn't accept a deal like this, that you raised concerns about secret side deals that the Obama administration had cut with Iran-- MIKE POMPEO: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --back then. So that any kind-- MIKE POMPEO: Oh, I remember it well, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --of annex-- she says there are secret annexes to this deal. MIKE POMPEO: Yes. She-- she-- I'm happy to talk with her. There-- there are-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Are there? MIKE POMPEO: There are no annexes that the members of Congress won't have a chance to see-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning they are all classified details-- MIKE POMPEO: The public-- the public document-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --that will be shared with Congress? MIKE POMPEO: The public document was released yesterday. There are two implementing elements that will be provided. They are secret. They are military implementation documents that are important to protect our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. Every member of Congress will get a chance to see them. They are classified, secret. There aren't any side deals. Remember, the side deals I was complaining about were deals that the American side-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MIKE POMPEO: --never got to see. John Kerry never got to see those side deals. This is-- this is not that. This is a fully transparent arrangement. And as for-- and as-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So there is no deal to keep a certain U.S. military presence in Afghanistan? MIKE POMPEO: And there-- the document that was made public yesterday is the complete agreement. The implementing elements of that will be available for every member of Congress to see. Know this. I saw what Congresswoman Cheney said, and I have an enormous amount of respect for her. The American people should know Donald Trump is not going to take words on a paper. We are going to see if the Taliban are prepared to live up to the commitments they've made. The Bush administration and the Obama administration both tried to get the words that were on the paper yesterday that the Taliban would break from al Qaeda publicly. We got that. That's important. Now, time will tell if they'll live up to that commitment is our expectation. They have promised us they will do so and we'll be able to see on the ground everything they do or choose not to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's a historic agreement. MIKE POMPEO: Thank you very much, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary, thank you for coming on to talk about it. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) (Excerpt from a Campaign Video) MARGARET BRENNAN: That was businessman Tom Steyer doing a little pre-primary dance in South Carolina. He did come in third, but he had hoped to do better and he dropped out of the race last night but rest of the candidates have moved on to Super Tuesday, and that's this Tuesday, when fourteen states will hold contests. Among them California and Texas. We have some new CBS News Battleground Tracker numbers for both of them. Out in California Senator Bernie Sanders is up with thirty-one percent support. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren come in behind Sanders with nineteen and eighteen percent, respectively. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has twelve percent, and the rest of the field comes in at under ten percent. Looking to Texas, the race is tighter. Bernie Sanders is in the lead here with thirty percent, but Joe Biden close behind him with twenty-six percent and Elizabeth Warren comes in at seventeen-percent support. Michael Bloomberg is at thirteen percent, and the rest of the field comes in at six percent or less. Joining us once again is CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto. We want to bring in CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Ed, this was a big and much-needed win for Joe Biden in South Carolina. What does this mean for him going into Tuesday? ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Well, his team would tell you this is the momentum they need to convince any late-deciding voter who is not a fan of Bernie Sanders to side with them instead. Their hope is that by the end of Tuesday, he emerges as the clear alternative to Sanders. It's pretty mathematically impossible, based on what polling is showing us right now, for somebody to surpass Sanders, especially because he is going to have such a big win, it looks like, in places like California. But they are hoping, the Biden team is, that in the next few days they are able to raise millions of dollars and again convince people that he is the leading alternative. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, does he have the enthusiasm that you say Sanders' supporters have? ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, that remains a key difference between these candidates which is that Bernie Sanders' supporters are the most enthusiastic of all the top candidates. That's why his numbers remain so stable. Those folks turn out for him. But Joe Biden still has a challenge in that regard. His supporters are less enthusiastic about him. Can he motivate them to turn out? I think it remains a key question. And, look, to that point, when you look at California, Texas, at these big delegate hauls, the Democrats give out delegates just to top finishers. And so they could very conceivably end up splitting the delegates along with some of these other candidates and then we move on into the spring. MARGARET BRENNAN: And there are a lot of delegates at stake here on Tuesday. A thousand three hundred forty-four, it's about thirty percent of what's needed for the nomination. So, Ed, how do the candidates sort of crack the threshold? Explain some of the math here. ED O'KEEFE: So there is, essentially, two numbers to look at on Tuesday night. There's the perception number, who wins the state? Who can say that they walked away winning the most states? But the more important number, ultimately, is the nomination number. Who gets closest to getting the one thousand nine hundred ninety or ninety-one delegates you need to get over the threshold and-- and win that nomination. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not winner take all. ED O'KEEFE: It is not. You have to hit fifteen percent in each congressional district and in the states. And so the numbers to look for are fifteen. So if you look at our California and Texas numbers right now, Mike Bloomberg is in trouble because he is not hitting fifteen percent. This could have been a very expensive overuse of his money if he can't hit fifteen percent in those two states. But this is why, despite not winning anything so far, Elizabeth Warren is still in this race. Because she sees that she is doing well enough in California and in Texas and in a few of these other states, likely, that she can get above fifteen percent and keep a pool of delegates that keeps her in the race going into later March and April. ANTHONY SALVANTO: And that Bloomberg number that you talk about is so critical because if he does do just well enough to pick up delegates, if he picks up delegates in some regions of these states, even if he doesn't win them, then that changes the math for everybody else. Now he is a player. But if he falls just short of it, then all those delegates can go to other top candidates, to a-- to a Biden or to a Sanders and that changes the math going forward for them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, can four hundred million dollars in ad spending close that gap? That's a big gamble. ED O'KEEFE: It could, potentially. Look, and, tonight, he is-- he is doing something that hasn't been done in a while. He is buying three minutes of advertising on NBC and CBS to talk about the coronavirus. And trying to cast himself as somebody who is a competent manager, who could probably help solve this problem, and would have tackled it sooner than the President. He can spend as much as he wants. But if he doesn't hit fifteen percent in these states on Tuesday, it will have been for naught, essentially. Certainly, they believe that they can go on into Florida and Arizona and Illinois next and-- and try to compete in later March contests. But, perhaps, the biggest loser last night in South Carolina was Mike Bloomberg because Joe Biden did so well. They needed Biden to stumble or to only win narrowly to help make the argument that he is the better moderate alternative. MARGARET BRENNAN: It couldn't have felt good for Tom Steyer to have spent over three hundred million-- two hundred million dollars, almost three hundred million on spending on ads. ED O'KEEFE: It's a warning sign because South Carolina was his-- was his petri dish. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ED O'KEEFE: It was his test that if he could do it there, he could do it anywhere. He couldn't. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Anthony and Ed, there are a lot of headlines after South Carolina saying this is now a two-person race but there are still a lot of people on the field. So-- ANTHONY SALVANTO: It remains a multicandidate race. There's no question about it. And I think part of that is you look at Bernie Sanders and you look at, despite that enthusiasm that he has, can he grow it? Can he draw people to him? And when we ask folks, most of the people supporting Sanders say they've already liked him. They've liked him for a long time. But far fewer say they've taken-- taken a second or third look at him as he's won these early states. So can he translate any success he's had into momentum going forward and build on that twenty-five, that thirty percent that he's already got? That, I think, remains a key question. ED O'KEEFE: This will not be clean. This is going to be a messy contest. It's different than what we've seen before because we have so many candidates. We are down to seven, the magnificent seven, perhaps, who are going into Tuesday. Will the field shrink after Tuesday? Probably. But, again, if you're somebody who can hit viability, fifteen percent in a few of these states, you have no reason to get out yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: It makes for some exciting political watching on Tuesday. ED O'KEEFE: And very little sleep. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: A very little sleep for (INDISTINCT). ANTHONY SALVANTO: A very long night with delegates coming as we go, as we go. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we'll-- we'll gear up for that with both of you. Thank you. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For a closer look at how prepared we are for the coronavirus here in the U.S., we turn to former FDA commissioner and physician Doctor Scott Got-- Gottlieb. Good to have you here. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Thanks. MARGARET BRENNAN: You served in the Trump administration. What do you think the administration is doing now that is right, wrong in its handling of the virus? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. Well, certainly expanding the diagnostic capability is the right move. We're going to have the capacity by the end of this week to diagnose probably ten thousand people a day or screen ten thousand people a day with the public health labs. Hundred labs doing hundreds tests a day. By the end of the week after that, we'll probably bring on another ten thousand. So we'll have testing capacity of, perhaps, as much as twenty thousand a day by the end of the next two weeks. Once we bring on the academic labs, that was really a critical step, bringing on those academic labs-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --and-- and leveraging their capacity. These are the major medical centers. What we need to do now is make a real concerted effort to get a therapeutic. We know when this started, but we don't know when this is going to end. And what's going to end it is our technology. Our savior here is going to be our technology. And we need to make a really robust effort to try to develop a therapeutic. MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning a treatment? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: A treatment or a vaccine. But a-- a therapeutic-- a treatment is going to be more likely to be available in the fall. A vaccine is a much longer way off. And we always knew when that once in a generation strain came along, and this might be that strain, that what we were going to have to depend on was our science and something to stop it like a treatment or a vaccine. A treatment, again, we could have by September, October, potentially. MARGARET BRENNAN: But more testing means more positive results. I mean you're saying, basically, expect the number of those who've been diagnosed with the virus to also increase? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's going to increase. This-- right now, there's probably hundreds or low thousands of cases. Everyone's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Hundreds or low thousands of coronavirus cases-- DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: In the U.S.-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --in the U.S. that aren't reported? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --that aren't reported yet. It's a big country three-- three hundred and forty million people, three hundred and thirty million people, so anyone's individual risk is-- is still very low. But we need to get those cases diagnosed and identified so we could start getting people quarantined and into treatment and prevent more spread. We need to start mitigating the implications of the spread. There was an analysis out today by Trevor Bradford, very good researcher out of the Hutch, looking at the genetic strains in Washington State. And by looking at the strains and the drift between the different strains for the people who have been diagnosed there, he's suggested that there's perhaps hundreds and maybe low thousands of cases. It's an interesting analysis. There probably are more cases. We have community spread now in Washington State, California, perhaps, Illinois, Oregon. So certainly hundreds of cases. MARGARET BRENNAN: So has the administration been slow in its response? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think the decision the administration made to block the travel, which was controversial at the time, clearly, bought us time. It-- it slowed the introduction of the virus into the country. Virus was probably here at that time, but it slowed additional cases. The question is what do we do with that time? I think there's some things we did that were very smart. We got the country prepared. One of the mistakes, one of the challenges was getting the diagnostic testing in place. I think what-- what we should have done and I don't want to, you know, armchair quarterback this, we relied on the CDC. We always rely on a CDC in a public health emergency. But simultaneous to that, we should have also been reaching out and trying to get the laboratory-developed tests into the game and the manufacturers, who have diagnostic capability. We've done that. You know, a couple of weeks went by and they did that. And that is now in place. And those labs are going to be coming online. So we course corrected. I think what it teaches us, if you're looking back, what is the teachable moment? It's don't take a linear approach to these crises, take an all of the above approach. And we need to do that now in a therapeutic. We-- we can't put all our eggs in the vaccine basket. We need to be looking at antibody-based prophylaxis, treatments, vaccines, and all of the above approach. If case one doesn't work out, we have other options. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you'd suggest that's the conversation the President should have tomorrow with the pharmaceutical companies-- DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Tomorrow is the vaccine manufacturers. MARGARET BRENNAN: --when he brings those-- DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think we need to look at the companies that-- that can develop antibody-based prophylaxis as well. We did that against Ebola. That is actually what we could potentially have for the fall-- fall or a small molecule drug that's currently on the shelf, trying to repurpose it for this. MARGARET BRENNAN: The NIH director, Anthony Fauci, a doctor, said that from what he's seen, if you get infected, you likely won't get reinfected. But there seems to be so much we don't know. If someone has just sort of mild or moderate symptoms, how do they last? How do you know to go and get tested? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's the challenge here. You don't. You know there isn't-- the spectrum of disease here is very wide. A lot of people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but they shed virus and they're still infective. They can still transfer the virus and a small percentage get very sick. And so, it's probably the eighty percent that are mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic that are the ones that are spreading it. The other thing is that people who get very sick, don't get very sick right away. The time to hospitalization in-- in different studies was nine to twelve days. So they start off with cold-like symptoms and then they progressively get more ill. And it's in that phase that people are spreading it. There was a very interesting analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine about two weeks ago that looked at viral load and viral shedding-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --across a spectrum of disease. And the people who are mildly symptomatic shed as much virus as the people who are very sick and that's atypical. Typically, the amount of virus you have and shed to-- in-- in some diseases comports with how much-- how much of virus you have. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Doctor, thank you very much for coming on and giving us-- DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot. MARGARET BRENNAN: --your analysis. We'll be back in a moment with a look at Super Tuesday and more. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with our panel. We brought in two of the big guns from the New York Times today. Edward Wong is a diplomatic correspondent, and Michael Crowley is a White House correspondent covering foreign policy. Good to have you both here. MICHAEL CROWLEY (The New York Times/@michaelcrowley): Thanks, Margaret. EDWARD WONG (The New York Times/@ewong): Thanks, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on what we haven't mentioned thus far in the show, that the President has made a choice to run the intelligence community. He's going to renominate a congressman, John Ratcliffe. Is he actually going to go through and get nominated and-- and confirmed? MICHAEL CROWLEY: Well, that's a big question. You know, President Trump was getting close to nominating Congressman Ratcliffe back in the summer, and met so much resistance from senior Republicans in Congress who said this man is not qualified. He's only been on the Intelligence Committee for a year, may have inflated his resume, and is much more partisan around the people who've held that job. The President pulled back and didn't do it. The question is now has Ratcliffe changed any minds? There's not a lot of evidence to that, but there may be a little bit of a game going on here because the President has installed Richard Grenell, his ambassador to Germany, in that job, in an acting basis and because of complicated things that have to do with the-- the-- how long acting directors can serve. By nominating a new person, even if President Trump doesn't think Ratcliffe can get confirmed, that allows Rick Grenell to stay in that job for a longer amount of time. There's another theory that Rick Grenell is even more unpalatable to people in Congress than Ratcliffe. So Ratcliffe may be the more acceptable alternative. So there's a lot going on here and people are trying to figure out what's real and what isn't. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I bring that up first because it gets to some of what we have been talking about today in terms of confidence in professionals versus political choices made for political reasons, and-- and confidence in-- in hard fact and in intelligence. Ed, I know you've been following, as you always do, you lived in China for so long, and you followed the origins of this outbreak of corona, when you heard the administration this week change its language so many times in describing and characterizing response, what did you make of that? And what do you make of what is actually known in terms of what China is sharing with the U.S.? EDWARD WONG: Well, I think that everyone agrees that full transparency or a large amount of transparency on this virus is necessary both, you know, to push forward with expertise on addressing the virus, plus, calming public fears over it. I think when an administration or government appears to be nontransparent on it then that creates problems. I think that the Trump administration really grappled with that this past week when you saw President Trump come out and say it was a new hoax by the Democrats or when-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And his chief of staff went out and-- and said the media's covering this-- EDWARD WONG: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --because they think it's going to take down the President. EDWARD WONG: Right. And I think that they're trying to adjust the language now from what I can tell. But I think that, you know, there's valid criticism of that. And I think if you compare that to the way Beijing reacted, there are some parallels in that communist party officials, Chinese officials really covered up the start of the virus, and there's a lot of information coming out these days that perhaps it started earlier, and that they kept the public from learning about it. We know that one of the key whistleblowers, Dr. Li-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. EDWARD WONG: --tried to warn health care professionals in a private chat group about it. And then he was even taken in by the police because of that and admonished. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MICHAEL CROWLEY: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Michael, I mean does the President now have the credibility and-- and the trust of the public at a moment of crisis when you need it most? MICHAEL CROWLEY: No, that's a huge problem here, Margaret. Think back to what happened when Hurricane Dorian was hitting the United States last summer President Trump made an inaccurate comment about the hurricane's path and was criticized for it. And then a day or two later, he's holding up a map showing the storm's forecasted path in the Oval Office and it appears to have been doctored with just the kind of sharpie pen that President Trump loves to use to sign documents. It really looks like they were altering information they were giving the public to make the President look good, to cover up for a mistake he had made. And President Trump has repeatedly bungled basic facts, including numbers of victims in the country. Yesterday he got the gender wrong of the person who died in Washington although he may have been briefed inaccurately. I will say, Margaret, that I do think that that briefing yesterday was a step in the right direction. Having all those health experts there-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MICHAEL CROWLEY: --particularly Doctor Fauci. There were questions about whether he was being muzzled. He said he was not, one of the nation's foremost authorities on these things. And I think President Trump understands he doesn't-- he wants the markets to bounce back. The markets want to see that kind of expertise in Trump-- expertise and-- and-- and credibility. And at least yesterday, there was a step in that direction. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see when markets open tomorrow what they thought of it. But, certainly, for the public, we'll continue to follow the details of this as we have on FACE THE NATION. Thank you all today for watching and each week as you do. We'll see you Tuesday night for CBS News' special coverage of the Super Tuesday results. We go on the air here on CBS at 8:00 PM eastern, 5:00 Pacific, and our CBSN coverage starts at 5:00 PM as well. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "Belarusian authorities claimed Tuesday that one of the country's leading opposition figures had been detained while trying to cross into Ukraine, a day after her allies said she had been bundled into a van by unknown men and whisked away. European nations had demanded that Belarus' government explain the whereabouts of Maria Kolesnikova after her disappearance, along with two other opposition figures, on Monday. On Tuesday, after officials in Minsk spent hours denying any knowledge of Kolesnikova's whereabouts, a spokesman for Belarus' State Border Committee claimed that she had been detained while attempting to cross overnight with two other members of the opposition's Coordination Council. He said two male members of the Council escaped, but Kolesnikova was arrested. Quickly the Belarusian government's version of events was challenged by members of the Opposition Council, speaking both on the record and anonymously to Russian media, and by a Ukrainian official. Kolesnikova and the two other council members, press secretary Anton Rodnenkov and executive secretary Ivan Kravtsov, disappeared on Monday morning. The council said a witness reported seeing Kolesnikova bundled into a minibus early that morning by unknown men. None of the three have been contactable by phone since they disappeared. Bychkovsky said that Rodnenkov and Kravtsov were able to cross into Ukraine, and the Ukrainian embassy in Minsk confirmed to AFP they were in the country. But Ukraine's Deputy Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko called Rodnenkov and Kravtsov's arrival in his country the result of a \"forcible expulsion\" from Belarus. He said Kolesnikova refused the same treatment and was taken into custody in her home country. Russia's Interfax news agency, citing anonymous sources close to the Belarusian opposition, also said Kolesnikova had refused to be expelled from Belarus at the border. Bychkovsky said Kolesnikova was being held and \"an investigation is under way to legally assess the situation.\"  Another senior member of the opposition Coordination Council, Maksim Znak, said Tuesday that none of the three council members \u2014 Kolesnikova, Rodnenkov, nor Kravtsov \u2014 had discussed any plans to leave the country. \"There is a lot that is strange in this story, voiced by Belarusian television,\" Znak said. \"None of them had any intentions to leave the country. We spoke [hypothetically], relatively speaking, if it was offered, prison or going abroad, Maria clearly said that she would not go anywhere.\" State news agency Belta quoted border officials as saying the three had tried to cross the border in a BMW around 4:00 am Tuesday. Bychkovsky, of the Belarusian border authority, told reporters that \"Rodnenkov, Kravtsov and Kolesnikova passed customs border control in a BMW car and moved towards Ukraine. However, later, meeting a border guard, the car accelerated sharply, posing a threat to the life of a serviceman of the border service.\" \"Kolesnikova found herself outside the vehicle. In fact, she was pushed out of the car, which continued to move towards Ukraine,\" Bychkovsky claimed, offering no explanation for why she might have been forced from the vehicle by her colleagues. Russian state-run media released security camera video showing the BMW appearing to pass uneventfully through the first checkpoint, but there was no video released of the second incident involving the alleged rush for the border, or Kolesnikova being ejected from the car.\u00a0 The Coordination Council was set up to ensure a peaceful transfer of power after President Alexander Lukashenko's main rival Svetlana Tikhanovskaya rejected his claim to have won an August 9 presidential election with 80 percent of the vote. The disputed election has sparked widespread protests and a harsh police crackdown that has seen several thousand people arrested. Germany and Britain had on Monday demanded answers after Kolesnikova went missing and allies said she had been snatched off the streets by unidentified men in black. Kolesnikova, 38, is the only one of the trio of women who fronted Tikhanovskaya's campaign to remain in Belarus. Tikhanovskaya left the country under pressure from the authorities and was granted refuge in EU member state Lithuania, while her other campaign partner, Veronika Tsepkalo, is now in Ukraine.",

All run by Democrats. All run by very liberal Democrats.\" The Democratic mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot, said she would welcome federal help to fight crime, but wants no part of what she's seen on the streets of Portland. \"We don't need federal troops. We don't need unnamed secret federal agents roaming around the streets of Chicago,\" she said at a press conference Wednesday. The agents in Portland look like soldiers, but in fact they are members of the Border Patrol far from their usual missions of going after drug smugglers along the Mexican border.\u00a0 They are under the command of Acting Director of Homeland Security Chad Wolf. \"These officers are not military; they are civilian police officers,\" said Wolf. \"These police officers are not stormtroopers. They're not the Gestapo, as some have described them.\" Mark Morgan, head of Customs and Border Protection, provided a citizen's guide to the insignia on their uniforms. \"Border Patrol \u2013 clearly police. It's marked on the front and the back, clearly, every single agent,\" said Morgan.\u00a0 As Portland's protests continued in the aftermath of George Floyd's death, the Trump administration moved in to protect federal buildings from vandals. Wolf described the targets of these federal officers: \"These individuals carry lasers, baseball bats, explosive fireworks, metal pipes, glass bottles, accelerants and other weapons all targeting federal facilities and federal law enforcement.\" There are plenty of protestors who do not fit that description \u2013 women who call themselves \"The Wall of Moms.\"\u00a0  Jesus feds just came directly for the Portland moms using batons and tear gas while carrying assault rifles.pic.twitter.com/3BwfniKDVU And Naval Academy graduate Christopher David, who stood his ground \u2013 but did not appear to threaten \u2013 the federal agents.

I had no idea what these guys were capable of.\" WEB EXTRA COMMENTARY: Christopher David: \"Our city has been turned into a war zone intentionally\" Even Portland's Democratic mayor, Ted Wheeler, who does not want these federal agents in his city, got hit with tear gas. \"I saw nothing which provoked this response,\" said Wheeler, who called it \"urban warfare.\"\u00a0 \"Never have I seen it before where the federal government has imposed its will on the state and says, 'We're going to do this mission whether you want us here or not,'\" said Paul Rosenzweig, who served in the Department of Homeland Security under Republican President George W. Bush. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin asked, \"It's unprecedented. Is it legal?\" \"It is probably on the borderlines of legal,\" Rosenzweig replied.  The Department of Homeland Security was created in the anxious days after 9/11 when another attack was feared: \"Terrorist attacks by al Qaeda or a nuclear weapon or a biological threat,\" said Rosenzweig. \"Never did we contemplate that they would actually be used against American citizens. And that's where the authority has been stretched beyond all recognition.\" And here's what most people don't know about DHS: \"The Department of Homeland Security has more law enforcement resources at its disposal than the rest of the federal government combined,\" Rosenzweig said. \"This is kind of the first time that the American public is seeing the reality of that.\" Acting DHS chief Wolf, who traveled to Portland to inspect the damage, said it is all about protecting federal property. But in addition to tear gas, there is more than a whiff of politics in the air. Rosenzweig said, \"The acting secretary has chosen to  essentially declare war on a segment of the American populace. It's  transparently a political exercise.\" Martin asked, \"Transparently political? What do you mean?\"  \"This is, I think, clearly part and parcel of  President Trump's ongoing political effort to demonize the left, to  try and make this election about cultural issues, and to scare the  American public into voting for him,\" Rosenzweig replied. However the Battle of Portland ends, there is something else at stake.\u00a0 Martin asked, \"What does it do to the image and reputation of the Department of Homeland Security?\"  \"This incident is going to do lasting damage to the department,\" Rosenzweig said. \"I think that the department is a necessary component of our national security apparatus.

            "article_content": "Moscow\u00a0\u2014 Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds more wounded since fighting erupted between Azerbaijan and Armenia just over a week ago. The two countries' military forces are clashing over the Azerbaijani breakaway territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, and with some major world powers backing opposing sides in the standoff \u2014 and the U.S. notably absent \u2014 there are concerns the conflict could escalate. International observers and analysts warn that, unlike during previous clashes along the two countries' shared border, it may be hard to negotiate peace this time, not least because NATO member Turkey has backed Azerbaijan and the United States appears uninterested in playing the vital role of arbiter.  Officials on both sides claim to have inflicted serious losses on the other's. Both sides claim the other has killed civilians, including new reports Monday by officials in Azerbaijan that the city of Ganja, home to more than 330,000 people, was being shelled by Armenian forces.\u00a0 Videos posted online from the battleground show an unprecedented use of heavy artillery, tanks, missiles, and even kamikaze drones as the fighting has escalated. Both countries accuse the other of refusing to agree to cease fire, and neither has shown any willingness yet to reengage in stalled peace talks. Armenia and Azerbaijan both used to be part of the Soviet Union, but since that crumbled, the new borders in the Caucasus region have remained in dispute.  When Soviet Communist rule was nearing its end in the late 1980s, the mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh's autonomous legislature voted to join Armenia. As the Soviet Union dissolved, Nagorno-Karabakh proclaimed its independence, which led to a war with tens of thousands of casualties. It has not been recognized by any other country as an independent state   Internationally still recognized as part of Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh is predominantly populated by ethnic Armenians. \u00a0 The long-simmering conflict has been mediated by the \"Minsk group,\" set up by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1994 and co-chaired by Russia, France and the United States.  The hostilities that began at the end of September are said to be the worst since 1994, when the war ended with a ceasefire and Armenia taking control of the region. Despite that ceasefire, skirmishes have continued along the so-called \"line of contact\" over the past three decades. The last serious flare-up was in 2016, when dozens of troops on both sides were killed. Then over this past summer tensions flared again, but this time, with a global pandemic distracting Europe and racial unrest and election year politics engulfing the U.S., there was no serious diplomatic effort made to deescalate the standoff. \"All the signals were in place, everything was telling that escalation was coming. And there was diplomatic silence,\" Olesya Vartanyan, senior analyst for the South Caucasus region at the International Crisis Group, told CBS News.  \"We are definitely one step away from a large-scale war in the region,\" she said, noting that such a conflict could embroil Russia, Turkey, or both. #NATO SecGen Jens Stoltenberg on Nagorno-Karabakh: \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the escalation of hostilities. All sides should immediately cease fighting & find a way forward towards a peaceful resolution. And I expect Turkey to use its considerable influence to calm tensions.\" pic.twitter.com/aAln8JkL9f Russia has close ties with both Armenia and Azerbaijan, and it has sold military hardware to both countries. Armenia is Russia's military ally, however, and Moscow has a base in the country.  Turkey, a member of NATO and also the Minsk group, has openly backed predominantly-Muslim Azerbaijan in the conflict, calling Armenia a threat to peace in the region.  The Armenian Ministry of Defense said last week that one of its jets was shot down by a Turkish F-16. A spokeswoman with the ministry said the Turkish plane took off from the territory of Azerbaijan, flew into Armenia and shot down the Armenian SU-25 military aircraft. Azerbaijan and Turkey have dismissed the allegation.  On Thursday, the U.S., France and Russia condemned the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh in a joint statement.  \"We call for an immediate cessation of hostilities between the relevant military forces,\" the statement by the presidents of the three countries said. \"We also call on the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to commit without delay to resuming substantive negotiations\"  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last week that he had called the foreign ministers of both Armenia and Azerbaijan to say Russia was willing to host talks. On Monday, Iran, which sits just to the south of both countries, also offered to help, with the regime saying it had \"plan\" ready to present to Armenia and Azerbaijan this week.  Thus far, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkey have all dismissed the international community's calls for a ceasefire and offers to broker peace talks. The Trump administration also issued a unilateral statement last week calling on the warring sides to show restraint, but it was the last major international actor to respond \u2014 a possible sign of the extent to which the White House is focused on the upcoming election, at the expense of diplomacy.  Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan spoke on Thursday with President Trump's National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien. Pashinyan later told French TV and The New York Times that he had raised the alleged use of U.S.-supplied F-16 aircraft in the conflict by Turkey, purportedly in support of Azerbaijan. \"The United States,\" Pashinyan told The New York Times, \"needs to explain whether it gave those F-16s to bomb peaceful villages and peaceful populations.\" He said O'Brien \"heard and acknowledged\" his concerns, and promised to arrange a phone call between Armenia's leader and Mr. Trump.\u00a0 But that all transpired just as Mr. Trump was confirmed to have contracted the new coronavirus and was quickly admitted to Walter Reed hospital in Washington for treatment. Vartanyan, of the International Crisis Group, noted that President Trump's recent predecessors all made efforts to pacify previous flare-ups between Armenia and Azerbaijan. \"Even before the fighting, many senior officials in the region told me they felt no U.S. interest in this conflict for more than three years,\" she said. Washington's atypical disengagement in this instance could leave room for a further escalation of the conflict, according to Thomas de Waal, a senior fellow with the Carnegie Europe think tank. \"The flare-up can also be seen as a symptom of a world in which the U.S. is no longer acting to defuse regional conflicts,\" de Waal wrote in a commentary published by last week by Politico Europe.",

            "article_content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered at least two people executed, banned fishing at sea and locked down the capital, Pyongyang, as part of frantic efforts to guard against the coronavirus and its economic damage, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers Friday. Kim's government also ordered diplomats overseas to refrain from any acts that could provoke the United States because it is worried about President-elect Joe Biden's expected new approach toward North Korea, lawmakers told reporters after attending a private briefing by the National Intelligence Service. One of the lawmakers, Ha Tae-keung, quoted the NIS as saying Kim is displaying \"excessive anger\" and taking \"irrational measures\" over the pandemic and its economic impact. Ha said the NIS told lawmakers that North Korea executed a high-profile money changer in Pyongyang last month after holding the person responsible for a falling exchange rate. He quoted the NIS as saying that North Korea also executed a key official in August for violating government regulations restricting goods brought from abroad. The two people weren't identified by name. North Korea has also banned fishing and salt production at sea to prevent seawater from being infected with the virus, the NIS told lawmakers. There are few ways to independently confirm the reported fishing ban and other information given by the NIS to the lawmakers. Ha didn't say whether the ban applied to all North Korean waters or whether it was still in effect. North Korea recently placed Pyongyang and northern Jagang province under lockdown over virus concerns. Earlier this month, it imposed lockdown measures in other areas where officials found unauthorized goods and foreign currencies that were brought in, Ha cited the NIS as saying. North Korea also made an unsuccessful hacking attempt on at least one South Korean pharmaceutical company that was trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine, the NIS said. The agency has a mixed record in confirming developments in North Korea, one of the world's most secretive nations. The NIS said it couldn't immediately confirm the lawmakers' accounts. North Korea has maintained that it hasn't found a single coronavirus case on its soil, a claim disputed by outside experts, although it says it is making all-out efforts to prevent the virus's spread. A major outbreak could have dire consequences because the North's health care system remains crippled and suffers from a chronic lack of medical supplies. The pandemic forced North Korea to seal its border with China, its biggest trading partner and aid benefactor, in January. The closure, along with a series of natural disasters over the summer, dealt a heavy blow to the North's economy, which has been under punishing U.S.-led sanctions.  North Korea's trade with China in the first 10 months of this year totaled $530 million, about 25% of the corresponding figure last year. The price of sugar and seasoning has shot up four times, Ha quoted the NIS as saying. North Korea monitoring groups in Seoul said the North Korean won-to-dollar exchange rate has recently fallen significantly because people found few places to use foreign currency after smuggling was largely cut off following the closure of the China border.  According to the NIS briefing, North Korea ordered overseas diplomatic missions not to provoke the United States, warning their ambassadors of consequences if their comments or acts related to the U.S. cause any trouble in ties with Washington. North Korea's government has remained silent over Mr. Biden's election victory over President Trump, with whom Kim held three summits in 2018-19 over the North's nuclear arsenal. While the diplomacy eventually stalled, the meetings helped Kim and Mr. Trump build up personal ties and stop the crude insults and threats of destruction they had previously exchanged. Lawmaker Kim Byung-kee cited the NIS as saying that North Korea is displaying anxiety as its friendly ties with Mr. Trump become useless and it has to start from scratch in dealing with the incoming Biden administration. Experts have been debating whether North Korea will resume major missile tests soon to try to get Mr. Biden's attention. During past government changes in the U.S., North Korea often conducted big weapons launches in an attempt to increase its leverage in negotiations with a new U.S. administration. The NIS expects North Korea will hold a military parade ahead of a ruling party congress in January in a show of force timed with Mr. Biden's inauguration. North Korea is also likely to use the Workers' Party congress to lay out its basic policies toward the U.S., Kim Byung-kee cited the NIS as saying. Kim Jong Un has said the congress, the first of its kind in four years, will set new state objectives for the next five years. In a highly unusual admission of its policy failure in August, the Workers' Party said North Korea's economy had not improved due to severe internal and external barriers and that its previous developmental goals had been seriously delayed.",

            "article_content": "With less than a week before Election Day, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it will not grant an expedited review of a Pennsylvania GOP appeal of a mail-in ballot extension in the state. The court previously split 4-4 on a request from Pennsylvania Republicans to halt the state high court's decision to order the extension. The court could still decide to hear the case, however, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Joined by two other justices, Justice Samuel Alito acknowledged there was little time remaining to make a change, but said they were open to it. \"I reluctantly conclude that there is simply not enough time at this late date to decide the question before the election,\" he wrote. \"That does not mean, however, that the state court decision must escape our review.\" The ruling came after Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar told counties to separate ballots received within the 3-day extension after the election, meaning that a court decision could theoretically come after Election Day. \"The Secretary continues to defend the extension to ensure that every timely and validly cast mail-in and absentee ballot is counted,\" Boockvar wrote in the guidance to counties. But Boockvar, a Democrat, said that because the issue is still pending before the court, the action was necessary. Trump campaign senior counsel Justin Clark called Boockvar's guidance \"a big victory\" in a statement. In Las Vegas today, President Trump said he hopes the ballots received after Election Day aren't counted. \"Hopefully, the few states remaining that want to take a lot of time after Nov. 3 to take ballots, that won't be allowed by the various courts because as you know, we're in courts on that,\" he said. Over twice as many Democrats as Republicans have applied to vote by mail in Pennsylvania. In the state's primary, counties received over 100,000 ballots after Election Day, over twice Mr. Trump's 2016 margin of victory in the state. President Trump is hoping to drum up support in the battleground state of Nevada, holding a rally Wednesday afternoon across the border in neighboring Arizona due to the Silver State's coronavirus restrictions. The president's Western swing comes with just six days left until the election, as early voting totals continue to show high turnout across the country. Early votes in Arizona and Nevada account for more than 60% of the total ballots cast in those states four years ago. A senior Trump campaign official told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0the president plans to visit 10 states during the last week of the campaign, and hold 11 rallies in the 48 hours before Election Day. At a rally in Bullhead City, Arizona, the president renewed his promise for a \"return to normal\" and a COVID-19 vaccine. \"A safe vaccine is coming very quickly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You are going to have it momentarily.\" Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's unprecedented effort to accelerate production and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine, is already producing tens of millions of vaccine doses, even before any vaccine candidate has been proven safe and effective. Retired Lieutenant General Paul Ostrowski, director for supply, production and distribution of Operation Warp Speed told\u00a0CBS News senior medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula, \"We will have vaccines, we anticipate, prior to the turn of the new year.\" The president, speaking from his hotel in Las Vegas Wednesday, also commented on the violent protests in Philadelphia, criticizing the city's Democratic mayor and governor for not doing more to enforce the laws there. He said the federal government is ready to step in at the governor's request,\u00a0CBS News digital White House reporter Kathryn Watson\u00a0reports. The unrest began after police shot a Black man, Walter Wallace, on Monday. The city's mayor and police commissioner have pledged an investigation into the incident. Violent clashes have followed for two nights, with roughly 30 police officers reportedly injured on the first night. The president said the violence had to stop, and claimed without evidence that Biden would be \"weak\" on crime and criminals. Like millions of other Americans, Joe Biden joined in on early voting and officially cast his vote for president on Wednesday, alongside his wife, Jill, in Delaware. The two flaunted their \"I Voted\" stickers after Biden attended a COVID-19 briefing with his health adviser team. Biden's message is rooted in contrast with Mr. Trump regarding the current response to the pandemic. Biden's campaign broadcast large graphs of COVID hospitalizations for Biden to appear next to as the candidate warned the cases of COVID will be a \"bigger wave of anything we've experienced to date.\" Biden said, \"The refusal of the Trump administration to recognize the reality we're living through at a time when almost 1,000 Americans are dying every single day is an insult to every single person suffering from COVID-19, and to every family who has lost a loved one.\" The Democratic nominee is heading back to Florida on Thursday, marking his fourth trip to the state during the general election. By the end of the week, if his schedule holds, the tallies of Biden's battleground trips since June 1, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson, include: 16 trips to Pennsylvania, four trips to Michigan, three trips to Wisconsin, two trips to North Carolina and Ohio, and one trip each to Minnesota, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Iowa. Senator Kamala Harris began her Wednesday in Tucson and was asked about the expanded map the Biden-Harris campaign is playing with in the remaining 6 days. She listed where she's been in the past week and where she'll go: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona. \"There are people all over our country who want to know that they are being seen and heard on some of the most challenging times in the history of our country,\" she told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. Harris also addressed the split screen rallies Trump would be holding in Arizona and Nevada on Wednesday and said she and Biden \"are going to talk to voters, but we're not going to do it in a way that we don't risk their safety and their health.\" At a drive-in rally in Tucson, Harris invoked the name of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain (\"Let's start with a little straight talk...\") and addressed some of the \"talk about my values,\" in reference to her being labeled as a liberal or socialist. \"Let me just tell you Tucson, I am a proud, patriotic American. I love my country. And our values reflect the values of America. Our values tell us we have witnessed the worst, the biggest disaster of any presidential administration in the history of this country, our values tell us that, \" she said. During a discussion of climate change, Harris seemed to address some of the blowback Biden got from the last debate on phasing out fossil fuels, notes\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. \"Understand we need to set time limits. Net zero emissions by 2050. We need to set goals that include an investment in renewable energies. And guess what? That's about jobs! Millions of jobs,\" she said. Harris' last event Wednesday is another drive-in rally alongside musician Alicia Keys in Phoenix. Trumbull County in eastern Ohio voted for President Obama by a large margin in 2012, but flipped in 2016 for President Donald Trump. Mr. Trump pitched an 'America First' economic message that resonated with Ohioans in 2016. After his election, the president visited the county, which was the home to General Motors Lordstown plant, in 2017 and told industrial workers that jobs would return and urged them not to sell their homes. Two years later, the plant closed its operation, which resulted in extensive job losses for those employees. Kathy DiCristofaro, the vice chair of the Trumbull County Democratic party, told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0that she believes that Biden will carry the county, citing voter registration efforts and new volunteers. \"People coming into the office were all new faces,\" she said \"They were not people that generally offered to volunteer before. We always have our core group of volunteers that work every cycle. But these were new people coming in and saying, 'I've never been politically involved.'\" At a recent rally in Circleville, Ohio, which is not in Trumbull County, President Trump continued to pitch an economic message, but it was focused on retaining the fracking industry in the state. The president and his campaign seized on Biden's comments in the last presidential debate that he would \"transition away from the oil industry.\" Biden has only made two visits to Ohio since June 1 and he recently said that he believes he has a \"fighting chance\" in the state. DiCristofaro said that voters in the county \"know Joe,\" adding that Biden is taking precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"Voters know that he realizes COVID is real and he's trying to protect, you know, people,\" DiCristofaro said. 2020 is breaking records and then some in terms of political spending. On Wednesday, the Center for Responsible Politics revised its previous estimate of the cost of the 2020 election from $11 billion to $14 billion. This comes amid a flood of cash in the final months of the election cycle which the Center for Responsive Politics attributes to both the Supreme Court battle as well as the closely watched presidential and Senate races. The $14 billion is more than double the cost of the previous most expensive election, which was in 2016, and is actually more than twice the cost of the past two presidential cycles combined. This comes amid unprecedented spending in the presidential race, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. The Center for Responsible Politics estimates that race will see $6.6 billion in total spending alone. In 2016, that number was $2.4 billion. \"Donors poured record amounts of money into the 2018 midterms, and 2020 appears to be a continuation of that trend -- but magnified,\" said Center for Responsive Politics executive director Sheila Krumholz. \"Ten years ago, a billion-dollar presidential candidate would have been difficult to imagine. This cycle, we're likely to see two.\" Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will be the first candidate in history to raise $1 billion directly from donors. Joe Biden in August and September broke monthly fundraising records. According to the Center for Responsible Politics, both parties are raising more from small-dollar donors who gave $200 or less which make up about 22% of all money raised this cycle as compared to 15% of money raised in 2016. But Democrats are raking in more from small-donors with nearly $1.7 billion raised while Republicans raised $1 billion from small-dollar contributors. Meanwhile, the Center for Responsible Politics points out, the 2020 North Carolina Senate race is the most expensive congressional race of all time, and the 2020 Iowa Senate race is in second place. The South Carolina and Arizona Senate races are closely behind. As of mid-October, eight of the top ten most expensive Senate races of all time have been in the 2020 cycle. A federal judge is ordering conservative operatives Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl to make \"curative\" robocalls to anyone who received a previous robocall that pair allegedly organized which spread misinformation about mail voting, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The new calls must be made by 5:00 p.m. ET tomorrow night and are required to say, \"At the direction of a United States District Court, this call is intended to inform you that a federal court has found that the message you previously received regarding mail-in voting from Project 1599, a political organization founded by Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl, contained false information that has had the effect of intimidating voters, and thus interfering with the upcoming presidential election, in violation of federal voting-rights laws.\" Burkman and Wohl are both facing felony charges in Michigan for their alleged involvement in the robocalls that targeted urban areas with large minority populations. The Michigan Attorney General's office says the calls went out to almost 12,000 people in Detroit and almost 85,000 calls were made nationally. \"We applaud the court's order that these defendants be made to issue a new robocall to correct the misinformation they disseminated,\" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement. \"Voting is a cornerstone of our democracy and all voters should be able to cast their ballot without confusion or fear.\" President Trump held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, on Tuesday night - but it's what happened after the rally that many reporters and attendees are talking about says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. Police said the last person was loaded into a bus from the site of the rally close to midnight, hours after it ended,\u00a0CBS News digital producer Caitlin O'Kaine\u00a0reports. According to a preliminary report, seven people were transported to area hospitals \"with a variety of medical conditions,\" Michael Pecha, public information officer for the Omaha Police Department, said in an email to CBS News. He said 30 people were contacted for medical reasons. Pecha said 40 buses took about 25,000 people to the event site over a 10-hour period, from 10:00 a.m. to the start of the rally at 8 p.m. In an emailed statement to CBS News, Samantha Zager, deputy national press secretary for Mr. Trump's campaign, said: \"Because of the sheer size of the crowd, we deployed 40 shuttle buses - double the normal allotment - but local road closures and resulting congestion caused delays. At the guest departure location, we had tents, heaters, generators, hot cocoa, and hand warmers available for guests. We always strive to provide the best guest experience at our events and we care about their safety.\" Kris Surface Beckenbach, who was a volunteer at the rally, told CBS News that \"attendees waiting for transport had no information until an officer started providing updates.\" She said there was a 90-minute stretch where they saw no buses, and she saw people who needed assistance, but did not see any emergency situations. \"I was alone and it was dark,\" Beckenbach told CBS News via Facebook message, adding that some of her friends chose to walk to their cars in the cold. \"It was no one's fault that traffic was a mess,\" Beckenbach said. \"No one expected the number of attendees and vehicles.\"\u00a0 The chair of the Butler County, Pennsylvania, commissioners says USPS reached out to the county elections director to say they were investigating why \"many, many\" voters didn't get the mail ballots they were approved for reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. A USPS spokesperson said the Postal Service is unaware of any delays or issues with mail ballots in the county. The chairwoman, Leslie Osche, said she didn't know how many ballots could have been lost, but that the county is taking action when voters call and say they didn't receive their ballot, including sending sheriff's deputies to hand-deliver ballots. Those voters can also vote in person if they fill out a paper provisional ballot. Osche, in her fifth year as a commissioner, said the wide-ranging election changes in Pennsylvania this year have caused confusion and frustration for voters. Their elections call center took 2,000 calls in a 4-hour period last week, she said. \"I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime.\" The Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday\u00a0upheld Governor Greg Abbott's order\u00a0that limits counties to one mail ballot drop-off location, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The order, which has sparked legal and political controversy in the state, prevents some of the state's largest counties from setting up multiple drop-off sites. The unanimous decision from the all-Republican court overturned a lower court's decision to issue an injunction on Abbott's order. A state appeals upheld the lower court's decision last week. The battle began after Abbott issued an order in late July that allowed Texans to hand-deliver their mail ballots before\u00a0Election Day. Normally, absentee ballots in the state must be returned through the mail, except on\u00a0Election\u00a0Day, when voters can deliver their ballots in person. After that announcement, some counties -- including Harris County, home to Houston -- announced plans to have multiple ballot drop-off locations. On October 1, Abbott issued a separate order saying counties could only set up\u00a0one drop-off site, saying it would \"strengthen\u00a0voting\u00a0safety in Texas.\" The lawsuit, which was filed by the Anti-Defamation League and Common Cause, argued that Abbott didn't have the authority to put limits in place and imposed \"an unconstitutional burden on voters' right to vote.\" But the state Supreme Court disagreed. \"In the end, the plaintiffs' complaint is that the Governor ultimately decided not to increase their voting options quite as much as he initially announced,\" the justices wrote, adding, \"The Governor's October Proclamation provides Texas voters more ways to vote in the November 3 election than does the Election Code. It does not disenfranchise anyone.\" NORTH CAROLINA Though he's only served four terms so far, North Carolina Republican Congressman Richard Hudson is facing his third iteration of a Congressional district this year. After judges ruled in 2019 that the state's Republican legislature created \"extreme partisan gerrymanders\" with their district lines, Hudson's 8th district was redrawn to include all of Cumberland County, which voted for Hillary Clinton by 16 points in 2016. And with Democrats poised to pick up the 2nd and 6th District with the new maps, Hudson's race in the 8th district is set to be the most competitive House race in the state. \"25% of the district is brand new to him. So he's having to introduce himself to one fourth of the district population, just as I am,\" said Pat Timmons-Goodson, the Democrat challenging Hudson. Timmons-Goodson brings with her a stacked judicial background, serving on various state district and appellate courts before becoming the first black woman to serve on the North Carolina Supreme Court. She also served in the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights during President Obama's tenure and was nominated to be a U.S. District judge for the state, though her nomination was never taken up. \"A combination of those professional experiences, I would argue make me a good candidate and one for such a time as this,\" she told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0in an interview. Hudson has acknowledged Timmons-Goodson's achievements, telling the\u00a0Charlotte Observer\u00a0she's a \"historic figure in our state.\" His campaign and other Republican allies in the state have also used her record in the courts to portray her as \"soft\" on crime . \"As a judge, Timmons-Goodson opposed electronic monitoring of convicted sex offenders...Liberal Pat Timmons-Goodson, she'll never keep us safe,\" says one ad by the Congressional Leadership Fund. In response, Timmons-Goodson said the attacks have a \"fundamental misunderstanding\" of her role in the appellate process for those cases. She said the biggest policy contrast with Hudson is with healthcare, pointing to the Republican party's mission to repeal the Affordable Care Act without having a concrete plan on protecting pre-existing conditions. \"Taking healthcare from anyone is bad enough, but during a doggone pandemic? When you should be trying to increase those, and he has yet to call for an expansion of Medicaid in North Carolina,\" she said. Hudson has\u00a0dubbed himself\u00a0as \"Fort Bragg's Congressman\" in reference to the large army base and veteran population in the district. But Timmons-Goodson's allies ran an ad attacking Hudson for not voting on an annual Department of Defense spending bill, though a\u00a0CBS17 fact check\u00a0found it lacked the context that Hudson had helped write parts of the bill, was under quarantine and refused to use a proxy vote (he was part of a lawsuit against the practice). The fundraising between the two candidates has been tight, though Hudson does lead with his cash on hand. There's also been more than\u00a0$6.1 million in outside spending\u00a0for this race, with at least $2 million of it coming from CLF last week. Released internal polls from both campaigns have the race within the margin of error. Hudson's campaign is confident his record of veteran support will help turn out the Republican base in the central part of the district.Meanwhile, Timmons-Goodson sees Cumberland County and the Charlotte suburbs as key to her victory and was encouraged by the registration uptick in the state. \"I just don't believe that those folks are turning out like that to register their support for the status quo. I believe that they're out there to register their interest in change,\" she said. UTAH Republican Burgess Owens, who is challenging freshman Democrat Ben McAdams in Utah's 4th, has had an interesting 48 hours. On Wednesday, the\u00a0New York Times reported\u00a0that Owens exceeded the contribution limit by over $130,000, breaking federal campaign finance laws. Campaign spokesperson Jesse Ranney told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that the amount of donors and electronic donations (over 50,000) \"can occur without the campaign's knowledge. That is why the FEC has processes in place to handle this situation.\" In the latest fundraising report, Owens has closed his fundraising gap with McAdams and only slightly trails the incumbent's cash on hand. On Thursday, the\u00a0liberal non-profit Media Matters reported\u00a0that Owens said Democrats often conflate the\u00a0QAnon conspiracy theory network\u00a0with child trafficking. \"One of the things we need to recognize with the left is if they ever say the word conspiracy, let's look into it much deeper because there's something they're trying to keep us away from,\" he said on a conservative radio program. Owens had appeared on a\u00a0podcast tied to QAnon in September, though he said about QAnon on the radio show, \"Whatever this other group is, I have no idea.\" McAdams held a press conference Thursday calling on Owens to condemn QAnon, while talking about the need to protect children from predators and combat child sex trafficking. \"He seems to think he can say one thing when he's amongst his friends and fringe media, and another things when he's talking to Utah voters,\" McAdams said. \"We should hear from him directly, and unequivocally, not saying he doesn't know what it is but Google it and come tell us and reaffirm to anybody who might be questioning it - this is a debunked and false conspiracy theory that is getting in the way of the very real work of child exploitation, child trafficking.\" Owens' campaign said he had addressed QAnon in a debate, and said he has denounced all radical groups. \"Ben must not have been paying attention.The real question is how much money does Ben stand to make off of his next deal with Zions Bank?\" referring to an accusation by the\u00a0Salt Lake County Republican Party. Trent Christensen, a former vice president at Zion's Bank, aimed to challenge McAdams but lost to Owens in the Republican primary. The Cook Political Report rates the race here in Utah's 4th as a toss-up.",

            "article_content": "The authoritarian president of Belarus made a dramatic show of defiance Sunday against the massive protests demanding his resignation, toting a rifle and wearing a bulletproof vest as he strode off a helicopter that landed at his residence while demonstrators massed nearby. In the 15th day of the largest and most determined protests ever in independent Belarus, a crowd of about 200,000 rallied against President Alexander Lukashenko in a square in the capital city of Minsk. They then marched to another rally and approached the Independence Palace, the president's working residence. Video from the state news agency Belta showed a government helicopter landing on the grounds and Lukashenko getting off holding what appeared to be a Kalashnikov-type automatic rifle. No ammunition clip was visible in the weapon, suggesting that Lukashenko, who cultivates an aura of machismo, aimed only to make a show of aggression. Protests started August 9 after a presidential election that officials say handed the 65-year-old Lukashenko his sixth term in office with 80% voter approval. Opponents claim the results are fraudulent. The size and duration of the protests have been unprecedented for Belarus, a former Soviet republic of 9.5 million people that Lukashenko has ruled harshly for 26 years. On Sunday afternoon, an opposition rally overflowed Minsk's sprawling 17-acre Independence Square. There were no official figures on crowd size, but it appeared to be about 200,000 people or more. The demonstrators then marched to another square about 1.5 miles away and approached the edges of the presidential residence grounds, where police in full riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder, holding large shields. The protesters dispersed in the evening amid rain. There were no immediate reports of arrests. Earlier this month, some 7,000 people were arrested at protests, many of them badly beaten with clubs or wounded by rubber bullets, violence that only caused public outrage to swell. Lukashenko appears to be flailing about for a strategy to counter the anti-government demonstrations. He has repeatedly blamed Western interference, claimed the protests were backed by the United States and accuses NATO of building up troop concentrations in Poland and Lithuania on Belarus' western border, which the alliance denies. He also claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin was willing to offer security assistance to his government to quell the protests if he asked for it. Lukashenko has consistently repressed opposition during his time in office and weariness with his hardline rule, as well as dismay over the country's deteriorating economy and Lukashenko's cavalier dismissal of the coronavirus pandemic, appear to have galvanized opponents. \"Belarus has changed. Lukashenko has been able to unify everybody, from workers to intelligentsia, in the demand for change,\" said protester Slava Chirkov, who attended Sunday's demonstration with his wife and son. They held a sign declaring \"Lukashenko, your milk has gone sour,\" referencing Lukashenko's former job as the director of a Soviet-era collective farm. An opposition Coordination Council was created last week to develop a strategy for a transition of power, but authorities in Belarus have opened a criminal probe into its formation. Also Sunday, more than 50,000 Lithuanians joined hands in a human chain stretching 20 miles from the capital of Vilnius to the Belarus border to express solidarity with the protesters.",

            "article_content": "The historic White House Rose Garden is getting an upgrade for the first time in nearly 60 years. First Lady Melania Trump faced backlash after revealing the restoration plans Monday \u2014 just months before the election, as coronavirus cases continue to surge in many states.\u00a0 Mrs. Trump said she wants to return the garden to its original 1962 glory, when it was designed by Rachel Lambert Mellon, a friend of President John F. Kennedy. Mellon wrote that she was found inspiration during an October walk along Fifth Avenue in New York City, when she was awestruck by magnolia trees outside of the Frick Museum.\u00a0 Plans are already underway to restore the famous garden, the first lady said during a rare appearance Monday. It hasn't been redone since the Kennedy era, but the announcement emphasized the need for a renovation after decades of use and modern updates, in order to \"appreciate the elegant symmetry of the Mellon plan.\"\u00a0 Even in the most difficult times, the @WhiteHouse Rose Garden has stood as a symbol of strength & continuity. Today, it is my pleasure to announce our plans to renew & restore this iconic space so that we preserve its history & beauty for generations to come. \"The very act of planting a garden involves hard work and hope in the possibility of a bright future,\" said Mrs. Trump in the announcement. \"Preserving the history and beauty of the White House and its grounds is a testament to our nation's commitment to the care of this landscape and our dedication to American ideals, safeguarding them for our children and their children for generations to come.\" The project is expected to be completed in about three weeks. Work has already begun, with tarps and drapes spotted hanging on the West Wing and the Oval Office, The Associated Press reports.\u00a0 Perry Guillot, the landscape architect working on the project, told AP that the biggest change to the garden will be the addition of a 3-foot-wide limestone walking path bordering the central lawn.\u00a0 The project will also make the garden more accessible for people with disabilities. Other changes will be made to drainage, infrastructure, plantings and audiovisual and broadcasting technologies.\u00a0 The Rose Garden, which borders the Oval Office and the West Wing, has been used for weddings, state dinners and presidential news conferences, among other historic events. Mrs. Trump herself used the space to announce her \"Be Best\" program in May 2018, and, most recently, President Donald Trump has used the space to hold his coronavirus press briefings. Following the announcement, \"Marie Antoinette\" trended on Twitter, comparing the First Lady to the French Queen for her announcement as millions of Americans are losing eviction protections and unemployment payments. \"I wonder if Marie Antoinette redid the gardens at Versailles when the revolution was brewing,\" writer Gary Legum tweeted.\u00a0 \"Marie Antoinette would TOTALLY nod her head to Melania trump's tone-deaf aloofness if she still had a head,\" writer Majid M. Padellan tweeted.\u00a0 Previously, Mrs. Trump has made changes to the Red Room, Blue Room and White House Bowling Alley. She also faced backlash for announcing the construction of a privately-funded tennis pavilion on the South Lawn during the beginning of the pandemic.\u00a0 She pushed back, tweeting at the time, \"I encourage everyone who chooses to be negative & question my work at the @WhiteHouse to take time and contribute something good & productive in their own communities.\" The Rose Garden will be overseen by the National Park Service and paid for with private donations.\u00a0 Sophie Lewis is a social media manager and trending content writer for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Beijing\u00a0\u2014 U.S. allies and competitors across Asia have joined the chorus of official government reactions to President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris's projected election victory. The reactions ranged from government caution in China, calculated reminders of friendships and alliances from Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, and national pride in India linked to Harris' half-South Asian heritage. China's official reaction has been most notable for who has not congratulated Mr. Biden and Harris: Neither President Xi Jinping or China's ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, have weighed in.   \"We have noticed that Mr. Biden declared he is the winner of the election,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in a notably reserved statement at a regular daily press briefing in Beijing. \"Our understanding is that the outcome of the election will be determined in accordance with U.S. laws and procedures.\" President Trump hasn't conceded his loss to Joe Biden, despite trailing in both the popular and electoral college votes. Beijing implied it would deal similarly with whichever party occupies the White House from January 20.  \"Our resolve to protect the country's sovereignty, security and development benefits will not waver,\" said Wang. \"We hope the new U.S. government can meet China halfway.\" But the less official voices of Beijing were less circumspect. State media and state-controlled social media were more critical of U.S. democracy \u2014 and President Trump, suggesting he had done lasting damage to U.S.-Chinese ties.  \"The U.S. political system is in degradation, which has caused strong repercussions in Western public opinion,\" wrote Hu Xijin, Editor-in-chief of the populist, patriotic tabloid Global Times, in a Monday op-ed. \"Trump has changed the U.S. \u00a0Even after he's gone, the political legacy he leaves behind will be difficult to eliminate.\" For its 1.4 billion citizens, Beijing has spun the U.S.' initial post-election uncertainty amid slow vote-counting into a narrative that bolsters the government's position: that China's Communist Party is far more organized and less divisive than the U.S.' democratic process.  \"Haha,\" tweeted the official account of the state-run People's Daily. China's largest newspaper group broke from posting official news articles over the weekend to reply to Donald Trump's own tweet, claiming he had won the U.S. election. The paper's four-letter post, which immediately went viral, also featured a laughing-crying emoji. Half a day later the paper had deleted the post, but only after it was liked and retweeted thousands of times. \u00a0 Hey look. Chinese state media \u201cPeople\u2019s Daily,\u201d @PDChina, just deleted its tweet trolling @realDonaldTrump saying \u201cHaha\ud83e\udd23.\u201d Screengrabbed it when I saw it 12 hours ago. #ICYMI.\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd It had been liked and retweeted tens of thousands of times. @CBSNews is here. \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 #Election2020 https://t.co/P7PjrsNkEX pic.twitter.com/iGNCKBRQxO \"In a nutshell, the last four years were not ideal years,\" said Henry Wang, President of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, the country's largest independent think-tank. He said Mr. Trump's term was characterized by a \"lot of misunderstanding\u2026 lot of mistrust\u2026 even though President Trump called President Xi 'a great friend.'\" Wang, however, told CBS News that, despite the tension, the two nations \"really cannot separate from each other\u2026 We cannot really fight each other. The world needs some coordination\u2026 leadership and\u2026 collaboration.\" South Korea's President Moon Jae-in first congratulated the election's projected winners in a weekend tweet, saying the U.S.-South Korea \"alliance is strong and the bond between our two countries is rock-solid.\"\u00a0  On Monday, Moon stressed his hope for an orderly transition at the White House, specifically to ensure that North Korea is not given any kind of opportunity to exploit.  \"We will see to it that there will be no pause in the strengthening of the ROK (Republic of Korea)-U.S. alliance and the advancement of the peace process on the Korean Peninsula. We will do our best to ensure that the invaluable achievements accomplished to date between us and President Trump's administration will extend seamlessly into the incoming U.S. Administration and progress further.\" Congratulations to @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. Our alliance is strong and the bond between our two countries is rock-solid. I very much look forward to working with you for our shared values. The U.S. has about 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea, ready to deal with any potential regional security issues, in particular involving North Korea or China.\u00a0 North Korea had not weighed in as of Monday. Some analysts believe the Kim Jong Un regime might have preferred a win by President Trump. The current president's made-for-television dalliances with Kim at bilateral summits in Singapore and Vietnam were publicity coups for the isolated dictator, but there has been little to show for them.  Biden has called Kim a \"thug,\" while Pyongyang has dubbed Mr. Biden a \"fool of low IQ.\"  Taiwan's president Tsai Ying-wen congratulated Mr. Biden by replying to a tweet he posted in January, praising her own re-election in a landslide vote.  \"Now it is my turn to extend congratulations to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,\" replied Tsai, Taiwan's first female president. \"The values on which we have built our relationship could not be stronger.\"\u00a0  Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen, @iingwen, returns a congrats to @JoeBiden after his January tweet for her own landslide win. \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddfc\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Many in Taiwan wanted @realDonaldTrump to win - perceived as being tougher on China, which threatens to reunite Taiwan by force. @CBSNews is here. \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 https://t.co/JHN0xCxmT9 By responding to Mr. Biden's own tweet, rather than just starting a new post, Tsai was reminding the president-elect \u2014 and the world \u2014 of his words: \"The United States should continue strengthening our ties with Taiwan and other like-minded democracies.\"\u00a0  It was a politically savvy move, prompting the incoming administration to remember Taiwan, where many were hoping Mr. Trump would be re-elected. Democratically-governed Taiwan is an island off China's coast, roughly half the size of the state of South Carolina and with a population of about 23 million people. Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province. China's president has vowed to unify Taiwan with his country, by force if necessary.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's regular bashing of China \u2014 from the coronavirus to trade \u2014 \u00a0and the White House's support of more arms sales to Taiwan, have made him a valuable ally in the face of a rising China. Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent tweets separately to Mr. Biden and Harris to congratulate them.  Because of her half-Indian heritage, Modi called Harris' ascent \"pathbreaking.\" The tiny ancestral village of Harris' maternal grandfather \u2014 Thulasendrapuram, in south India \u2014 had been praying for her win and, when the projections of the Biden-Harris victory came in, its several hundred residents set off fireworks and prayed at its Hindu temple.  Heartiest congratulations @KamalaHarris! Your success is pathbreaking, and a matter of immense pride not just for your chittis, but also for all Indian-Americans. I am confident that the vibrant India-US ties will get even stronger with your support and leadership. Harris' success puts India on the map of U.S. politics in a way it never has been. Modi will likely seek to leverage this as a bulwark against China's territorial claims along the two enormous Asian nations' shared, and heavily militarized, border in the Himalayas. Skirmishes flared over the summer that left more than 20 Indian soldiers, and possibly Chinese troops, dead.  But India's government may feel pressure from Washington as well, particularly over a controversial new citizenship law ushered in by Modi's Hindu nationalist government, seen as anti-Muslim, and over New Delhi's crackdown on residents in the majority-Muslim Kashmir region.  Japan's recently-installed prime minister Yoshihide Suga also tweeted \"warm congratulations\" to Mr. Biden and Harris, and was one of Asia's first leaders to do so.\u00a0  \"I look forward to working with you to further strengthen the Japan-US Alliance and ensure peace, freedom, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond,\" said Suga. Warm congratulations to @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. I look forward to working with you to further strengthen the Japan-US Alliance and ensure peace, freedom, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The prime minister's quick move came as no surprise, as Japan has stood as a political, military and economic bastion in Asia against China as the strongest country-level ally of the U.S. in the region. The bilateral relationship has endured for decades, regardless of who occupies the White House.  On Monday, Suga continued his praise.  \"Japan and the U.S. are allies that share universal values such as liberty and democracy,\" Suga said. \"We'd like to work together with the U.S. to further strengthen the alliance and secure peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.\" Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who recently stepped down for health reasons, managed his relationship with Mr. Trump well. He came to be seen as one Mr. Trump's closest friends among world leaders.  Abe flew to New York to meet then-President-elect Trump even while President Obama was still in office. Local reports suggest a Biden White House could usher a return to more typical relations, with little expectation that Suga would visit Washington until next year. ",

            "article_content": "Insurgents stormed a maternity ward in a hospital in the Afghan capital on Tuesday, leaving 14 people dead, including two newborns and some mothers and nurses. Tariq Aryan, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior, said 15 more were wounded in the attack. The ministry said all of the attackers had been killed. International humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders runs the maternity clinic in the hospital, and an official with the organization said foreign doctors were operating there at the time of the attack. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity and would not elaborate on the nationality of the doctors. Afghan special forces were dispatched to quell the attack and managed to help get about 100 people, including babies, women, children and three foreign nationals to safety, according to Aryan. The 100-bed hospital is located in the western part of Kabul, in a predominantly Shiite Muslim neighborhood where ISIS-affiliated militants have carried out several deadly attacks in the past. The Taliban has denied responsibility for Tuesday's attack. Afghan police shared photos from the operation that showed newborn babies being evacuated during the siege by police, some of them covered in blood. Kabul resident Daoud Jalal posted a video showing a member of the special forces rushing a newborn infant to an ambulance and commented: \"Welcome to Afghanistan, dear infant. We kill each other here. All of us are sorry to you. This is not how you should open your eyes. Sounds of explosions and screams should not be the first thing you hear.\" Another attack on Tuesday, in the country's eastern Nangarhar province, left at least 15 people dead and 56 more wounded. Provincial government spokesman Attaullah Khogyani said it wasn't immediately clear if the blast was from a planted bomb or a suicide attacker, but that it targeted a funeral ceremony for a local official. A member of the Nangarhar provincial council was among those killed and a member of Afghanistan's lower house of parliament was wounded. The Afghan government announced on Monday, meanwhile, a temporarily halt to the ongoing release of Taliban prisoners, citing a lack of balance in the agreed exchange of detainees under the deal reached between the U.S. and the Taliban. Javid Faisal, a spokesman for the office Afghanistan's National Security Advisor, said the Taliban should have released around 200 members of the Afghan Security forces under the agreement by this week.\u00a0  \"The Taliban have to clarify to us and everyone\" the status of some 610 Afghan national security forces still missing, Faisal said.  Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News the group did not have an exact number of the government prisoners still being held by the group. Mujahid said they had released 253 members of the security forces so far, but the government rejects that claim and says most of those released by the Taliban have been civilians. The United States and the Taliban agreed the terms of the prisoner swap after months of negotiations in Doha, Qatar. Under the deal struck in February, 5,000 Taliban prisoners were to be set free in exchange for 1,000 Afghan security forces within 10 days of the agreement. However, President Ashraf Ghani refused to free the Taliban militants all at once, and instead issued a decree to release the inmates in several phases.  Afghanistan's national government is currently in a state of political deadlock following a disputed election last year, which has been complicated further by the coronavirus pandemic paralyzing the country economically.",

            "article_content": "Minsk\u00a0\u2014 In an unprecedented show of public outrage, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Minsk for the 10th straight night of demonstrations against the autocratic president of Belarus, who they say stole an election.\u00a0 \"Get out! Get out! Get out!\" chanted young and old, many waving Belarusian flags and posters that read, \"WANTED, DEAD OR ALIVE,\" bearing the image of Alexander Lukashenko, known as \"Europe's last dictator.\" He has ruled over the former Soviet state for 26 years, with virtually no accommodation for dissent.  The current unrest kicked off after Lukashenko claimed to have won another term \u2014 with 80% of the vote \u2014 in an August 9 election widely perceived as rigged.\u00a0 Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has contested the results and fled to neighboring Lithuania after suggesting her children's lives were at risk.\u00a0 Riot police in Belarus have violently suppressed protesters, pelting them with rubber bullets, water cannon, and in some cases even live ammunition. At least three people have been killed and thousands were swept up in a wave of mass arrests. Many have been released, and some have spoken of beatings and torture in custody, further fueling anger at Lukashenko. \"We are not afraid,\" Ilona Elyashevich, who works for an urban development organization in Minsk, told CBS News as she protested in front of the House of Government. \"The worst has already happened to us. We want a new government, a new president. We want clear and honest elections.\"\u00a0 Lukashenko made an offer for constitutional changes in a bid to quell the unrest, but only after telling striking factory workers there would be no new vote, \"until you kill me.\"\u00a0 Speaking in a video statement, exiled opposition leader Tikhanovskaya called Wednesday on European Union leaders to reject the official election results. \"For the second week in a row my nation is peacefully fighting for its constitutional right to elect its leaders,\" Tikhanovskaya said in English. \"I call on you not to recognize these fraudulent elections. Mr. Lukashenko has lost all the legitimacy in the eyes of our nation and the world.\"  EU leaders were meeting to discuss the crisis Wednesday. Tikhanovskaya, 37, emerged as the president's main rival in the past election after her husband, who had planned to run against him, was jailed. She has said she's ready to step in and lead her nation until a new, fair election is held in the country.\u00a0 Her representative in Minsk told reporters on Tuesday that she expected Tikhanovskaya to return and engage in a peaceful transition of power. The opposition in Belarus has launched a coordination council to organize a peaceful transfer of power, if Lukashenko agrees, or is forced to back down. The protests and strikes, demanding he resign, continue across the country meanwhile.  The council, a body designed to unite and streamline the efforts of various anti-government activists and groups formed by civil society members, was expected to hold its first meeting on Wednesday.\u00a0 Lukashenko has refused to step down, and he accuses the opposition council of plotting to seize power in the country.\u00a0 \"We view it unambiguously: This is an attempt of a coup, with all ensuing consequences,\" Lukashenko said during a televised meeting with the Belarusian Security Council on Tuesday. Lukashenko said Wednesday, after several days of relative calm protests in Minsk, that he had ordered his security forces to end the unrest, according to Belarusian news agency Belta.  Moscow \u2014 and President Vladmir Putin personally \u2014 has long been Lukashenko's closest and most valuable ally, but it wasn't immediately clear how far the Kremlin would go to protect the embattled strongman next door. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned Wednesday against foreign interference in Belarus, offering the Kremlin's first official comment on the protests.\u00a0 \"We consider everything happening in Belarus as an internal affair of this country,\" Peskov told reporters, according to a transcript published by Russian media outlet Meduza. \"We believe that in the current situation the main thing is that there is no outside influence.\" Peskov said Russia had seen attempts to interfere from outside the country, but he declined to elaborate. Putin's government has gone to significant lengths to keep former Soviet nations on the edge of Eastern Europe under its sphere of influence, and out of the EU's. As his unilateral and internationally condemned annexation of Crimea away from Ukraine showed, he's willing to use official and unofficial Russian military forces to that end.  On Wednesday, Lukashenko said there were no foreign forces inside Belarus, and that he was bolstering security at the borders to prevent any coming in. He said it as rumors began to swirl that Russian forces were already on their way in to back up his forces. Chris Livesay is a CBS News foreign correspondent based in Rome.",

He pointed to Mr. Trump's appeal to the white working class, a demographic which has turned out to vote in increasing numbers since 2012. \"When it comes to rallies, when it comes to identification, that's who Trump signals to,\" Blyth said, arguing that the president has tried to establish himself as the champion of the white working class. \"It's very hard to build a winning electoral coalition without them.\" Blyth said that he believed the election is \"going to be closer\" than polls indicate. Former vice president Joe Biden is leading in several national polls, as well as in some critical battleground states. \"I actually expect the whole thing to end up in the Supreme Court,\" Blyth predicted. And if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed as a Supreme Court justice ahead of the election, as expected, then conservatives would have a 6-3 majority on the court. This could benefit Mr. Trump in any election-related case. But Blyth also argues that Mr. Trump has failed to fulfill some of his promises to the white working class, like building a border wall and bringing back manufacturing jobs. \"I just see net negative after net negative and yet he manages to convince large numbers of people that he's making America great again. It's an incredible Jedi mind trick,\" he said. Blyth, who focuses on the political power of anger in his book, says anger is a powerful tool being used by the president to maintain support. \"He's allowing that anger to come out as a sense of moral righteousness that binds that coalition together,\" said Blyth, comparing Trump supporters to the \"generation of exhaustion\" supporting Biden. Blyth also slammed Mr. Trump's position on climate change, as the president has rolled back several environmental regulations and denied the impact of global warming. \"When you have a climate change denier-in-chief running the United States, that is a big problem at the global level,\" he said.

            "article_content": "The Texas Supreme Court on Friday blocked a lower-court order that had allowed residents to vote by mail if they cite concerns about catching the coronavirus at polling places. Republican state Attorney General Ken Paxton petitioned the court for the stay after an appeals court upheld a lower-court ruling last month that lifted restrictions on mail-in voting. The stay prevents county election officials from formally taking mail-in ballot applications from voters afraid of coronavirus exposure, which they can do beginning 60 days before an election. Texas held its primary in March, and it wasn't immediately clear whether the high court would hear arguments and issue a final ruling before Election Day in November. Voting by mail in Texas is generally limited to those 65 or older or those with a \"sickness or physical condition\" that prevents voting in person. Paxton petitioned the Republican-dominated high court after officials in some predominantly Democratic areas approved measures to would allow voters to claim a disability and request mail-in ballots if they are worried about getting sick at polling places. County officials and Texas Democrats cast Paxton's move as an effort to disrupt the election and an ongoing voting case. The attorney general's request contends officials in counties that include Dallas, Houston, Austin, El Paso and the border community of Brownsville have broadened eligibility to vote by mail beyond what the Legislature intended. The ruling comes as the virus has deepened the partisan divide over mail-in voting, with President Trump claiming it is ripe for fraud and Democrats embracing the practice as the safest way to vote during the pandemic. House Democrats included significant funds to bolster states' election infrastructure in a massive coronavirus relief bill passed Friday, in the hopes of assisting states to prepare for potential vote-by-mail general elections. \"Protecting the integrity of elections is one of my most important and sacred obligations,\" Paxton said in a statement. \"The Legislature has carefully limited who may and may not vote by mail. The Travis County trial court's decision to allow everyone to vote by mail is contrary to state law and will be reversed on appeal. I am pleased that today the Texas Supreme Court confirmed that my office may continue to prosecute voter fraud and issue guidance on mail-in ballots while that appeal plays out.\" Conversely, Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa called the decision \"a dark day for our democracy.\" \"The Republican Texas Supreme Court is wrong to force the people of Texas to choose between their health and their right to vote,\" Hinojosa said in a statement. \"They would have Texans die, just so they can hold on to power. Voters should have the ability to vote-by-mail during a pandemic if they feel their health is in danger. ... We will continue to fight like hell to protect every eligible Texan's right to vote and have their voices heard by their government.\" Meanwhile, several states have postponed or\u00a0transitioned their primaries to be mainly vote-by-mail due to concerns about the virus, including Republican-controlled states like Ohio, Montana and Indiana. In Georgia, which has a Republican governor and legislature, absentee ballot applications are being mailed to all active voters. On Friday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced that the state's primary would be mainly conducted via vote-by-mail, with absentee ballots to be mailed to all registered Republicans and Democrats.

            "article_content": "Johannesburg, South Africa \u2014 While much of the world was waiting anxiously for the results of the U.S. presidential election last week, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was sending soldiers to the north of his own country. He said troops loyal to the regional administration in the Tigray province had attacked a national government military base, and he was responding to quell the violence. \u00a0\u00a0 But the crisis has escalated quickly, with the Reuters and AP news agencies citing government sources as saying hundreds have been killed, on both sides. There has been no independent verification of the figures, as Abiy's government has cut communication links in Tigray.\u00a0 The rapid escalation of the crisis has shocked many observers, especially coming after the Ethiopian leader received the Nobel Peace Prize just last year for helping end a two-decade conflict with neighboring Eritrea. \u00a0 He came into power with an ambitious agenda, promising to transform what was one of Africa's most repressive countries and root out corruption. The Tigray People's Liberation Front felt they were disproportionately targeted by his efforts.  Prior to Abiy's election, the ethnic Tigrayan people had dominated Ethiopian national politics, despite making up only about 6% of the population. Abiy belongs to the country's largest ethnic group, the Oromo. The tipping point came in September, when Abiy postponed parliamentary elections due to the coronavirus. Tigray leaders said it was a ploy by Aiby to mount a power grab, and they defied the ban, going ahead with their own elections in the region. The tension came to a head last week with the purported attack on a military base.\u00a0 On Monday, Abiy played down the clashes as \"law enforcement operations,\" which he said would conclude as soon \"as the criminal junta is disarmed, legitimate administration in the region restored, and fugitives apprehended and brought to justice \u2014 all of them rapidly coming within reach.\"  The United Nations has offered to help resolve the conflict and the African Union has called for a ceasefire, but no breakthroughs appeared imminent as of Tuesday, there was a deep fear that Ethiopia could descend into all civil war along ethnic lines.  Abiy has said he's not ignoring international calls for calm and has vehemently denied that his country is on the brink of civil war.\u00a0 On Tuesday, reports said Abiy's forces had seized control of Tigray's airport, as allegations that neighboring Eritrea was engaging in the fight highlighted the risk of the crisis snowballing into not only a civil war, but a regional conflict. Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael accused Eritrea of sending troops across the border to back up Abiy's forces by attacking regional troops. Eritrea's Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed rejected the allegation in a phone interview with Reuters, saying it remained \"an internal conflict\" for Ethiopia. \"We are not part of the conflict,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "A 24-year-old real estate investment CEO and motivational speaker is the winner of a North Carolina House GOP primary, The Associated Press projects. Madison Cawthorn won the nomination against Lynda Bennett in the 11th Congressional District runoff on Tuesday. Cawthorn won despite his opponent being endorsed by President Donald Trump, who tweeted his praise of her record earlier this month. The two newcomers faced off against each other after incumbent Mark Meadows chose not to seek reelection to be Mr. Trump's chief of staff. Meadows also endorsed Bennett. Despite beating a Trump-endorsed candidate, Cawthorn said the election's outcome wasn't a rebuke of the president. \"I want to make something clear: I support our great president,\" Cawthorn said in a victory statement that was posted to Facebook. \"I do not believe this election has been a referendum on the president's influence. The people of western North Carolina are wise and discerning. You observed both candidates and simply made the choice you believed is best for our district.\" FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      \n\nMadison Cawthorn Wins Republican Primary Runoff Election in NC-11 \n\n(HENDERSONVILLE, NC) \u2013... According to his website, Cawthorn garnered endorsements from three retired lawmakers as well as former 11th district candidates. Perhaps his longest list of endorsements come from county commissioners and sheriffs around the region. Cawthorn ran on a platform embracing religious freedom and border security and opposing abortion and what he deems socialized medicine. According to Ballotpedia, his key goals are combating socialism, enacting congressional term limits and implementing an amendment that mandates the budget be balanced. He stressed that adversity is what ultimately inspired him to seek higher office. Cawthorn was partially paralyzed in an automobile accident in 2014 and credits the life-changing event with strengthening his faith and perseverance. Though Cawthorn is a relatively young candidate, he is not ineligible from being elected. House members are constitutionally required to be at least 25 years of age or older and Cawthorn will hit that milestone in August. During his campaign announcement in January, Cawthorn stressed that his age was a net positive, stating that he represents \"an emerging generation of Americans who are tomorrow's leaders.\" He will face Democrat Moe Davis in November.",

            "article_content": "Moscow\u00a0\u2014 Belarus' authoritarian president visited Russia Monday in a bid to secure more loans and political support, as demonstrations against the extension of his 26-year rule entered their sixth week. Alexander Lukashenko's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi come a day after an estimated 150,000 people flooded the streets of the Belarusian capital, demanding Lukashenko's resignation.  The Interior Ministry said 774 people were arrested in Minsk and other cities of Belarus for holding unsanctioned rallies on Sunday. Putin said that Russia would provide a $1.5 billion loan to Belarus and fulfill all its obligations under a union treaty between the neighbors. Speaking at the start of the talks, he emphasized that the Belarusians themselves must settle the situation without any foreign meddling, and commended Lukashenko for his pledge to conduct a constitutional reform. Protesters in Belarus have dismissed Lukashenko's claimed reelection for a sixth term in an August 9 vote, widely seen as rigged. The United States and the European Union have criticized the election as neither free nor fair and urged the Belarusian leader to engage in talks with the opposition, a demand he has rejected. The opposition has dismissed Lukashenko's talk about constitutional reform as an attempt to win time and assuage the protesters' anger. Putin hailed it as a \"timely and reasonable\" move that would help \"reach a new level in the development of the political system.\"  In a bid to win Moscow's support, the 66-year-old former director of state farming has tried to cast the protests as an effort by the West to isolate Russia, which sees the neighbor as a key bulwark against NATO and a major conduit for energy exports to Europe. As he sat across the table from Putin, Lukashenko pointed at NATO's military drills near Belarus' borders and said the two countries must strengthen their defense ties. Putin emphasized that Russian paratroopers who arrived in Belarus for joint drills that began Monday will leave the country after the exercise.  Russia and Belarus have a union treaty envisaging close political, economic and military ties, but they have often engaged in acrimonious disputes. Before the election, Lukashenko repeatedly accused the Kremlin of pressing Belarus to abandon its independence. But with the United States and the European Union criticizing the election and readying a package of sanctions, Lukashenko now has to rely squarely on Russia's support. Despite frictions in the past, the Kremlin abhors the prospect of public protests forcing the resignation of the Belarusian leader, fearing it could embolden Putin's critics at home. Putin congratulated Lukashenko on his re-election and promised to send Russian police to Belarus if protests there turn violent, noting that there is no need for that yet. \"We see Belarus as our closest ally and we will undoubtedly fulfill all our obligations,\" the Russian leader told Lukashenko during Monday's talks. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opposition challenger who left for Lithuania a day after the vote, under pressure from the authorities, warned Putin that any agreements he may reach with Lukashenko will not stand. \"I'm very sorry that you have opted to have a dialogue with the usurper and not the Belarusian people,\" she said Monday. \"Any agreements signed with Lukashenko, who lacks legitimacy, will be retracted by the new government.\" Pavel Latushko, a former culture minister and ambassador to France who was forced to leave Belarus after joining the opposition's Coordination Council, warned that while the Kremlin is standing by Lukashenko now it may move later to engineer his departure. \"Lukashenko discredits himself each day, and when he completely loses his authority it would be easier for Moscow to replace him,\" Latushko told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from Poland. \"The Kremlin already has made a decision and is moving to fulfill a careful plan to have Lukashenko removed.\" Alexander Klaskousky, an independent Minsk-based analyst, believed that for the Kremlin, a push for deeper integration between the two countries makes no sense now because of Lukashenko's precarious position.  Klaskousky predicted that the Kremlin might prod Lukashenko to de-escalate the crackdown on protests and engage in political maneuvering to ease tensions, while looking behind the scenes for a candidate to replace him. \"Massive protests aren't abating, and the barbed wire, water cannons and hundreds of detainees underline Lukashenko's pitiful condition, forcing the Kremlin to start looking for an alternative,\" Klaskousky said. \"Putin would hardly want to put all eggs in one basket.\" As Belarusian authorities continued to target the opposition with pressure and arrests, the United Nations Human Rights Council agreed to hold an \"urgent debate\" on Belarus on Friday. Western and Latin American countries supported the motion, while Venezuela and the Philippines sided with Belarus. African nations mostly abstained. In a speech on Monday, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet emphasized that all allegations of torture by the security forces should be documented and investigated. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, strongly urged the Belarusian authorities to stop using force against demonstrators, release all political prisoners and start a dialogue with the opposition.  \"Unfortunately, every day brings new evidence that Lukashenko's rule is supposed to be preserved with fear and repression,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 Health authorities in New Zealand were scrambling Wednesday to trace the source of a new outbreak of the coronavirus, as the nation's largest city went back into lockdown. Authorities had confirmed four cases of the virus in one Auckland household from an unknown source and were awaiting the test results of four more people they suspect have infections - two work colleagues and two relatives of those in the house.  The cases this week were the first known local transmission of the virus in New Zealand in 102 days. The cluster came as an unpleasant surprise to many and raised questions about whether the nation's general election would go ahead as planned next month.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said more than 200 people with connections to those in the house were contacted Wednesday.  \"Our plan of mass testing, rapid contact tracing and, of course, our restrictions to stop the chain of transmission has been in full swing in Auckland today,\" Ardern said. Investigations were checking the possibility that the virus was imported on freight.  Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said one of the people who tested positive works at an Americold food cold-storage facility in Auckland, which was being swabbed to check if it was possible source of the infections.  \"We do know from studies overseas that actually, the virus can survive in some refrigerated environments for quite some time,\" he said.  Bloomfield said two of the people who had tested positive had traveled to the city of Rotorua while suffering symptoms over recent days and had visited several tourist attractions.   \"People in Rotorua and indeed around the country should be vigilant about their health and seek advice if they have symptoms,\" he said.  Auckland was moved to Alert Level 3 at midday Wednesday, a designation initially set to continue through midnight Friday. That means non-essential workers are required to stay home, while bars, restaurants and most businesses will be closed.  The rest of the country was moved to Alert Level 2, meaning mass gatherings are limited to 100 attendees and people are required to socially distance themselves.  Bloomfield said they would use genome sequencing as part of their effort to find the source of the new outbreak.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she had worked quickly to impose the Auckland lockdown measures after first learning about the cases Tuesday afternoon.  She said Aucklanders were also \"strongly encouraged\" but not mandated to wear masks, and that authorities were releasing 5 million masks from a central supply. New Zealanders haven't widely worn masks before, although authorities have been urging people to buy them or fashion them from scarves or bandannas just in case.  The nation's parliament was due to be dissolved Wednesday ahead of a general election on Sept. 19 as lawmakers hit the campaign trail. But Ardern said she was delaying the dissolution until at least Monday in case lawmakers needed to meet at short notice. She said she was also seeking advice about options for the election.  Under New Zealand law, the government could delay the election for up to about two months. The main candidates have already cancelled most of their planned upcoming campaign events.  The outbreak was found after a man in his 50s went to his doctor Monday with symptoms and was swabbed twice, testing positive both times. Three more people in his household tested positive later.  The case has health authorities scratching their heads, as the man hadn't recently traveled overseas and had no immediately apparent connection with infections contained at the border.  Until Tuesday, the only known cases of the virus in New Zealand were 22 travelers held in quarantine after returning from abroad.  New Zealand has been praised globally for its virus response and had just celebrated reaching 100 days without any known community transmission.  The South Pacific nation of 5 million initially got rid of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease, stopping its spread.   Life had returned to normal for many people as they attended rugby games at packed stadiums and sat down in bars and restaurants without fear of getting infected. But some had warned that the country had become complacent.",

            "article_content": "In the first presidential debate, former Vice President Joe Biden told voters that Roe v. Wade was \"on the ballot\" this election \u2014 a claim President Trump disputed, despite campaigning on an anti-abortion rights platform. But in two states, abortion is on the ballot in a literal way: ballot measures. Voters in Colorado and Louisiana will decide on ballot measures that promise to shape the future of abortion access in their respective states, both in the short- and long-term. Those efforts represent what many experts say is the future of abortion rights in America: a state-by-state battle over the procedure as the fate of Roe v. Wade becomes less certain under a conservative Supreme Court. The 1973 landmark ruling required every state to legalize abortion in at least the early months of pregnancy, but if the court decides to reverse the decision \u2014 which could happen as soon as next term \u2014 states would be free to prohibit the procedure entirely.\u00a0 \"States are trying to position themselves for whatever comes next after Roe,\" said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the Florida State University College of Law and the author of \"Abortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present.\" \"Everyone knows that Roe is not long for this world.\" In Colorado, voters on Tuesday will consider Proposition 115, a ballot measure that would prohibit abortion after 22 weeks of pregnancy. The proposal offers only one exception: if an abortion is \"immediately required to save the life of the pregnant woman when her life is physically threatened,\" according to the text of the proposition. The ban doesn't offer exceptions for victims of rape or incest, or in situations of severe fetal abnormalities, conditions that typically aren't detectable until later in a pregnancy. Currently, Colorado is one of seven states without a gestational limit on abortion, allowing access to the procedure later in pregnancy in the very limited circumstances in which it's federally allowed. Terminations after about 24 weeks of pregnancy are generally only legally allowed to happen in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, such as when the fetus is no longer viable, or to save the life of the patient. The vast majority of pregnancy terminations happen early in pregnancy, and only 1.3% of abortions happened at or after 21 weeks of pregnancy in 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Because of its laws, Colorado has become a haven for patients seeking the procedure later in pregnancy; if the ballot measure is successful, the implications would stretch far beyond the state's borders. Last year, 11% of the abortions performed in Colorado were for patients from 30 different states, according to the state's Department of Health. Only six other states and Washington, D.C. have similarly broad abortion laws: Alaska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont. That's a group that Erin Behrens, the measure's sponsor, is hoping her state will leave. In an interview with Denver radio station KHOW, the millennial anti-abortion rights activist called Colorado the \"late-term abortion capitol of the United States.\" \"Over the past couple of years it has been very concerning to me \u2014 I am learning about Colorado's laws \u2014 and lack thereof \u2014 around abortion,\" Behrens said. \"And so I have been working to create awareness that Colorado is one of the worst states in the entire country \u2014 it's one of the worst places in the entire world \u2014 for late-term abortion.\" Recent polling shows voters narrowly disapprove of the ban. And opponents of Proposition 115 have far outraised its supporters, according to data compiled by Ballotpedia. Supporters of Colorado's proposed 22-week abortion ban have raised a little more than $500,000 while its opponents have raised nearly $7 million. In Louisiana, voters will consider a ballot measure that's more hypothetical: an amendment to the state constitution opposing abortion. If passed, the measure, Louisiana Amendment 1, the \"No Right to Abortion in Constitution Amendment,\" would add one line to the state's Declaration of Rights: \"To protect human life, nothing in this constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\" Given that the state has passed nearly 100 anti-abortion restrictions since Roe v. Wade, including a law that would automatically prohibit abortion in the event that Roe is overturned, experts believe the measure is more political than practical. \"No one is realistically expecting anyone in the Louisiana Supreme Court to find a right to abortion in the state's constitution,\" Ziegler said. \"But it is a way for Republicans to signal how they feel about things and get voters excited.\" Louisiana's measure \u2014 referred by its supporters as the \"Love Life\" amendment \u2014 is one in anticipation of a post-Roe world. If approved, the amendment won't change how patients access abortion in the state for now, but instead would set up an obstacle for abortion rights groups in the event Roe is overturned and states decide for themselves whether to legalize the procedure.  In 2018, ballot measures in Alabama and West Virginia established similar anti-abortion constitutional amendments, joining Tennessee, where voters approved one in 2014. In 10 states, including California, Massachusetts and New York, voters have gone the other direction, approving measures that establish a right to an abortion, regardless of Roe. \"By passing the Love Life Amendment, we will ensure that no judge can ever recognize a right to abortion,\" said Louisiana state lawmaker Katrina Jackson in an advertisement supporting the measure. Jackson, who sponsored the amendment, was also the author of the Louisiana abortion restriction the Supreme Court struck down earlier this year. \"We will ensure that unborn babies all across this state are protected on the day that Roe v. Wade is overturned,\" Jackson said.",

            "article_content": "No telling who will win the election, but there is no better place to ask than in Ohio. Since 1896, Ohio has sided with the presidential winner 93% of the time. Ohio hasn't missed since 1960 and no Republican has ever won the presidency without Ohio. We asked Ohio in 2016 when national polls showed a lead for Hillary Clinton. Back then, Ohio voters told us they saw more excitement for Donald Trump. And he won the state by eight points. But now, in Ohio, he and former Vice President Joe Biden are essentially tied. This past week, we returned to ask Ohio. You know a president is playing defense when he spends vanishing time in a state he had easily won before. This was Mr. Trump, last weekend, putting a pre-Halloween scare into Circleville, Ohio. President Trump at campaign rally: Biden and the Democrats will offshore your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders, confiscate your guns, eliminate your private health care. They want to terminate your religious liberty. They want to destroy the suburbs. I am the best thing that ever happened to the suburbs. The suburbs are where Mr. Trump is fighting for his political life. They were critical to his victory in 2016. But polls suggest suburbanites are moving away from him. Randy and Cyndra Cole are Republicans, raising four children outside Cleveland. Randy Cole: I'm gonna vote for President Trump. Scott Pelley: And Cyndra? Cyndra Cole: I'm going to vote for Vice President Biden. As they watched the final debate, polls showed Trump leads in men, but Biden leads among women. Randy Cole: Obviously, the president can be abrasive and confrontational and that's his style. But now as I've seen four years of the president's record, I do believe the people around him, his policies are those things that I agree with.\u00a0 Cyndra Cole: I believe that the Republican Party that I joined years ago has left me. Scott Pelley: And what are those values that you hold dear, that you don't believe the administration has followed? Cyndra Cole: There's such great divide right now in our country, and I think if we could talk about equity-- in terms of equality of opportunity, that there would be real solutions offered that both Republicans and Democrats could agree on. And the national debt. The president promised to eliminate the debt. And instead, it's increased by 36%. Scott Pelley: What is your impression of the way the president has handled the COVID outbreak? Cyndra Cole: So we're trying to not talk about that as a couple. That's one area that we tend to disagree.\u00a0 Randy Cole: As I cross my arms. Cyndra Cole: Yeah, right. I just wish he would have been more transparent from the beginning. To come and look us in the eye and say, \"I know this is hard. Getting through this is going to be hard. We have to do this together.\" Randy Cole: But the pandemic itself is a complex situation. And I do think that the president mobilized a task force, he mobilized industry, he's working with the 50 state governors. I do think it's unfair that he's being labeled as causing 220,000 pandemic deaths. Ohio's known infections reached an all-time high this past week as voters were going to the polls. Scott Pelley: You lost someone to COVID. Tommie Jo Brode: I did. My grandmother. Yeah. We first met Tommie Jo Brode in 2016. She's an attorney, a corporate executive. Last time, she was voting Trump and still is. Scott Pelley: And despite that personal loss, you still believe the president's done a good job with the disease? Tommie Jo Brode: I believe that people who pass away do that in God's time. So, President Trump has a lotta power, but not more than God.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: When we sat down four years ago, you said this about Donald Trump, \"I trust Donald Trump\u2026\" Brode in 2016: \"...I trust him to protect this nation and keep my family safe.\"\u00a0 Scott Pelley: How has he done on that score? Tommie Jo Brode: A-plus. Scott Pelley: A-plus? Why do you say so? Tommie Jo Brode: I think he has kept his promises. I feel more confident in the United States military than I ever have. I have not seen domestic terrorist problems and threats that seemed to be creeping and looming when he took office.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: Ronald Reagan in 1980 famously asked, \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\"\u00a0 Tommie Jo Brode: Emphatically yes. My 401(k)'s in good shape. That matters to me. Being able to-- just to save a little bit of money and have a little bit of extra things in life is important to my family. And with a good economy, we've been blessed to do that. But there is also the curse of the coronavirus recession that came out of left field. Ohio unemployment is over 8%. We took advantage of Akron RubberDucks's idle ballpark to have a socially distanced visit with workers from an American industrial icon.\u00a0 Bob Schrock: I've been at Goodyear for 27 years. My dad was at Goodyear for over 40 years. His dad was at Goodyear for, you know, 30, 40 years. In the 1950s, Akron had 50,000 rubber workers. Now it's 700. More than anyone, blue-collar men assembled the president's 2016 Ohio victory. Scott Pelley: Show of hands, how many of you intend to vote for President Trump? Two over here. And how many of you intend to vote for Mr. Biden?\u00a0 Bob Schrock, Mark Sesock, Dan Gruelle and Charles Pierce split their votes for different reasons.\u00a0 Charles Pierce: I think President Trump's done a great job on trade. Replacing NAFTA with the USMCA was a very, very big thing for America. He's used his business acumen and negotiating ability to bring a lot of jobs back to America. Scott Pelley: Mark, you're supporting former Vice President Biden.\u00a0 Mark Sesock: The one issue that President Trump can't get from behind is the response to the coronavirus within this country. We have the best health care available to our citizens and I really believe that the leadership of this country failed our citizens in protecting the people. Dan Gruelle: My number-one issue that I completely support Donald Trump on is his pro-life stance. There's, to me-- that is the most important issue in my life.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: Bob, what are the most important issues to you in supporting former Vice President Biden? Bob Schrock: You know, workers' rights, workers' protections. My right to join a union and to collectively bargain, to fight for my good health care, for my 40-hour work week, overtime after eight, over 40-- holidays, paid time off, vacations, these are things that unions have fought for, for decades.\u00a0 Ohio manufacturing jobs grew a slight 2% during the president's term but that growth was wiped out by the pandemic. Don\u2019t buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less! (This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!). The president didn't help himself in Akron recently, after hearing that Goodyear doesn't allow political clothing in its shop. He tweeted, \"Don't buy Goodyear tires\u2014they announced a ban on MAGA hats. Get better tires for far less!\" \u00a0 Mark Sesock: I've never heard of a sitting president call for a boycott of an American company. Maybe Mr. Trump didn't know the Akron plant handcrafts all the tires for NASCAR, one of his constituencies, plus, one other customer. Mark Sesock: We also make the president's limo tires. So, I think he underestimates how many jobs are out there, good-paying jobs, to support your family. And I just thought it was irresponsible. Jawanza Colvin: Some of the things that have come out of this president's mouth has angered me, my family, our congregation. Reverend Jawanza Colvin of Cleveland's Olivet Institutional Baptist Church told us the words of the president inflame division. To Colvin, it's an opportunity to get out the vote. Jawanza Colvin: There will be a world after Donald Trump. And we're voting for that world.\u00a0 In 2016, Ohio's African American vote was down six and a half percent. When we first met Lisa Tolbert, back in 2016, she didn't see enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 2016 interview Scott Pelley: When African-Americans vote in large numbers in Ohio, Ohio votes Democratic. And when they don't come to the polls, Ohio votes Republican. What's gonna happen? Lisa Tolbert: I'm gonna pray that they come to the polls. I'm gonna-- Scott Pelley: But you're not feeling that groundswell. Lisa Tolbert: I'm not hearing it.\u00a0 Last week, we found Lisa Tolbert recovering from COVID. But she worries more about her 20-year-old son. For fear of a police stop, she drives him to his night job.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: I wonder how this election feels to you?\u00a0 Lisa Tolbert: I know this election is more important. Because we have watched our president, to me, act a plumb fool for four years.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: Are you voting for Joe Biden or against Donald Trump? Lisa Tolbert: Mmmm. Is that both? Can it be a both answer?\u00a0 Scott Pelley: It can be any answer you want it to be. Lisa Tolbert: It can be both.I'm definitely voting against Donald Trump. But I do believe, more so than I probably thought about Hillary Clinton, I do believe Joe Biden could do the job. That doesn't sound like enthusiasm, but Ohio is seeing historic early voting. So far, 2 million have voted, about double the usual. Ron Smetana couldn't wait for his absentee ballot. Ron Smetana: We received it on the 14th of October. We dropped it off on the 14th of October. And on the 15th of October I checked the website and it had already been scanned and approved for counting.\u00a0 Smetana has a lot in common with his friend, Steve Plogsted. Both are retired Army lieutenant colonels, both life-long Republicans.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: How did you vote in 2016? Steve Plogsted: Trump. Scott Pelley: And what about this year? Steve Plogsted: It's gonna go Biden. Scott Pelley: And why not Donald Trump again? Steve Plogsted: Don't trust the man. He's supposed to be a leader. And he's a bully. Scott Pelley: So you're a Republican who's already voted for the Biden ticket-- Ron Smetana: I have. And I am, yes. Scott Pelley: There are fellow Republicans in Ohio who would ask, \"How could you do that?\" Ron Smetana:\u00a0 I could not vote for Donald J. Trump. His consistent lies, his handling of COVID, failure to follow science, whether it's with Anthony Fauci or climate science, I just cannot tolerate. Tommie Jo Brode: I think a vote for President Trump is a vote for lawfulness. Tommie Jo Brode told us she has no trouble tolerating the president's style if that 401(k), and her home, are secure. Tommie Jo Brode:\u00a0 I understand that people don't always like his approach. And that he doesn't come across as soft. You know, he doesn't maybe strike us as someone who wants to give out hugs. And I get that. And I want my pastor to give out hugs. It's not what I'm looking for in my president. Scott Pelley: Do you think Ohio's gonna go Trump again? Tommie Jo Brode: I do. I've driven all over the state of Ohio. People are enthusiastic. They are very enthusiastic. I think Ohio will not just be red; I think it'll be bright red. Scott Pelley: On the Sunday before Election Day, you're gonna say what to your congregation? Jawanza Colvin: First, I'll probably quote a hymn from Amazing Grace, \"Through many dangers, toils and snares we've already come. It was grace that brought us safe thus far and it's gonna be grace that leads us home.\" But grace without voting? Grace without going to the polls? We're gonna need a lot more than just grace. We're gonna need us to take that grace into our hands and into those polls. This Ohio is not a retread of 2016. Joe Biden is viewed much more favorably than Hillary Clinton. Ohio will come down to this; will African Americans turn out? Can Biden swing enough votes in the suburbs to overcome the president's big advantage in the countryside? And will Ohio extend its 56-year streak of getting it right? Produced by Henry Schuster. Associate producers, Sarah Turcotte and Catherine Herrick. Broadcast associate, Ian Flickinger.

            "article_content": "President Trump has endorsed former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville for U.S. Senate in Alabama, in a blow to his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who is also running for the seat. The race for Sessions' former Senate seat, currently held by Democrat Doug Jones, became a two-man race last week when the Republican primary resulted in a runoff between Tuberville and Sessions.\u00a0 Sessions was the first senator to endorse Mr. Trump, and in 2017, he gave up his seat to become the president's first attorney general. Now, he's being hit with the full force of the president's Twitter account in his battle to reclaim that seat. Mr. Trump tweeted his endorsement of Tuberville Tuesday, while results were coming in from the Democratic presidential primaries. \u00a0 \"Tommy Tuberville (@TTuberville) is running for the U.S. Senate from the Great State of Alabama,\" the president tweeted Tuesday night. \"Tommy was a terrific head football coach at Auburn University. He is a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down! Tommy will protect your Second Amendment..(which is under siege), is strong on Crime and the Border, and truly LOVES our Military and our Vets. He will be a great Senator for the people of Alabama. Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement. I love Alabama!\" Mr. Trump openly regretted his choice for attorney general after Sessions recused himself from the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump had largely stayed out of the race until last week. After the Alabama Republican primary went into a runoff between Tuberville and Sessions, the president blasted Sessions for failing to end the \"phony Russia Witch Hunt.\"\u00a0 Sessions, who served as attorney general until after the 2018 midterm elections, was often berated by Mr. Trump publicly for his recusal, an action which resulted in the appointment of former special counsel Robert Mueller. But Sessions continues to voice his support for Mr. Trump, touting his relationship with the president frequently as he campaigns. He reacted to the president's move in two tweets around midnight, saying, \"Of course, President Trump can endorse anyone he chooses for the U.S. Senate election in Alabama. But the Constitution expressly empowers the people of Alabama, and only them, to select their Senator. I intend to take my case directly to the people of Alabama. \"Even before he declared for the presidency, I fought for the principles that Donald Trump so effectively advocated in the campaign and has advanced as President. I believed in those principles then, I have always fought for them, and I will continue to do so.\" The runoff election will take place March 31.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with former FBI Director James Comey that aired Sunday, August 23,  2020, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back with former FBI Director James Comey. He used to be a registered Republican, but this week he will speak at the Convention on Founding Principles, which is a gathering of Republicans who are not happy with President Trump. Good morning to you.\u00a0 FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY: Good morning, MARGARET. I want to get your reaction and insight into what we learned this week, which was that the Southern District of New York indicted former Trump White House official and campaign strategist Steve Bannon for alleged fraud. He's now the sixth close Trump associate to be criminally charged by the DOJ. You used to run the SDNY. What do you make of this case? COMEY: Well, it's another reminder of the kind of people this president surrounds himself with. At this point, they could almost start their own crime family. It's a very serious case. The Southern District of New York has laid it out in a very detailed indictment called a speaking indictment. And he's in a world of trouble. MARGARET BRENNAN: A world of trouble. What do you mean by that? COMEY: Well, it's a very serious fraud case with a huge amount of money stolen from innocent victims, Americans who thought they were giving money to support the president's wall on the Mexican border and instead it was stolen. That will drive up the potential punishments for Mr. Bannon and his co-conspirators. And, you know, he's in trouble because the indictment lays it out in such detail, including excerpts from texts. If you're Steve Bannon, you're his lawyers, you're reading this saying, I'm going down here. And I don't know what the next steps are for him and his co-defendants, but that's what I meant by world of trouble. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate Intelligence Committee, we know, also sent a letter to the Southern District asking them to investigate Bannon for lying to Congress. Is there more that the public leads- needs to know about Steve Bannon and any links to election interference? COMEY: I don't know. I don't know what the Southern District of New York is doing. I think this indictment surprised a lot of people because they did it like the pros they are. They didn't talk about it until they were ready to bring the case. But people can learn an awful lot about Russia and the Trump campaign just by reading the thousand pages that the Senate Intelligence Committee put out this week. It tells a story that blows up the president's nonsense about it being a hoax, that blows up Bill Barr's nonsense about there being nothing to investigate. There's a story there that the American people, if they're interested, can read and learn a whole lot about the kind of characters who were working with Russia during the 2016 campaign. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you more about that in a moment. We will have to take a break. But very quickly, what do you see as the biggest threat to the rule of law right now? COMEY: That even-handed law enforcement has disappeared from the Justice Department under Bill Barr and Donald Trump. It shouldn't matter whether Trump likes you or not. Everybody should get a fair shake. And that the truth is under attack--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. COMEY: --both by the attorney general and the president. Those things matter. That's why I'm speaking for the first time-- MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. COMEY: --ever at a political event this week. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We're going to take a break and come back and continue our conversation with former Director Comey in just a few minutes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're continuing our conversation with former FBI Director James Comey. I want to pick up where we left off, which was that Senate Intelligence report. This is a bipartisan report, meaning Republicans signed off on it. This was three years long. And the conclusion here was that Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort represented a, quote, \"grave counterintelligence threat\" to the U.S. because of his close work with Russian intelligence officer Konstantin Kilimnik. This goes farther than what Mueller concluded and made public. Why? Why is the public just now hearing about it? COMEY: Because the Senate Intelligence Committee was looking at all information they could gather. Mueller was approaching it as a prosecutor, trying to see what evidence he could bring into court to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt. And so the Senate Intelligence Committee could look much more broadly and, as you said, came to this conclusion that the head of Trump's campaign was funneling information to a Russian intelligence officer, someone he likely knew was a Russian intelligence officer. Let that sink in and then ask yourself, so there was nothing to investigate here, as Bill Barr says, it was a hoax? The Republicans have exploded that nonsense. MARGARET BRENNAN: The report, though, also was critical of your old agency, the FBI. It said your bureau should have done more to alert DNC officials that Russian hackers had accessed their servers. Why didn't the FBI do this? This was a national security threat happening under the nose of the FBI. COMEY: Yeah, that's- I understand that. That's fair criticism. I think at the time, our folks thought that just telling an institution that the Russians are inside your house was enough. But I think part of what may have led to a lack of urgency at the DNC and at the FBI is that nobody anticipated this wasn't normal intelligence gathering by the Russians, this was an effort to weaponize. And if anybody had seen that, I think they would have yelled a little bit more loudly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that a mistake on your part? I mean, how did the FBI miss that this was an active measures campaign by a foreign intelligence service? COMEY: That's a great question. I think the simple answer is because it had never happened before, but if I were still director of the FBI, that wouldn't be a good enough answer. I hope they're taking a look back across the intelligence community and asking, so why didn't we imagine that the Russians might do this? But the truth is that we didn't. Nobody in the intelligence community did. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were FBI director, you never imagined this scenario. I mean, don't you think this was a mistake on your part? COMEY: I sure think it was a miss- a mistake, I'm not going to quibble on words. Yeah, it was a miss. I don't know why it didn't occur to us that the Russians were doing something that they had never done before, which is to weaponize and actually fire stolen material at our democratic process. And, look, looking back in hindsight, it seems obvious. I don't know the answer as to why nobody in the intelligence community, none of the analysts, saw this coming. And it ought to be something that we're asking ourselves. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we still this vulnerable?\u00a0 COMEY: Yes, in a different way. I'm sure the Russians will use different tactics because we've figured out what they were last time. They achieved their objectives in the last election. They've done incredibly well under President Trump. They want him to stay in office. They'll be coming again. And the problem for us as Americans is you can't effectively stop a threat that the president won't even acknowledge exists. And so, sure, they're going to be in our house again, messing with us. The only way we're going to kick Putin out of our elections is to elect Joe Biden president so someone finally puts real pain on the Russians. MARGARET BRENNAN: What does real pain look like? I mean, we've been warned by the U.S. intelligence community that interference is happening again. President Trump is talking about election interference in very different terms. I actually want to play for you something that he said this week. He said that this will be the most fraudulent election in US history. And he told this to Fox News. (ROLL CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to have everything. We're going to have sheriffs and we're going to have law enforcement and we're going to have hopefully U.S. attorneys and we're going to have everybody. And attorney generals. (END CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: He's talking about fraud at the ballot box. He's talking about fraud in the mail. He's talking about fraud by receiving a ballot in the first place. What the president just described in that soundbite is frankly illegal in many states. It's up to local authorities when it comes to sending out local law enforcement, but he's making clear what he wants to see happen. What do you make of what he's laying out? COMEY: Well, I'm sure the next question Fox News asked was, what are the facts that support your allegations of fraud? And there were crickets. I trust state, local and federal law enforcement to honor their oath to the rule of law and to not be part of suppressing votes. There's a legitimate role for law enforcement to play in connection with elections. And I'm confident that the men and women in law enforcement at all levels will abide by their oath. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 In other words, not do this. In terms of-- COMEY: Yeah, this is- this is America. We don't- we don't, at least we don't anymore, we did it a whole lot to African-Americans when I was a child, we don't anymore use cops to scare people away from polling places. We just don't do it. And I'm confident that police officers around this country are not interested in being part of an illegitimate effort like that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you, the Justice Department is investigating the investigation into 2016. Do you know if you are a witness or a target or have you sat for an interview with John Durham as part of the investigation? COMEY: Yeah, I have no idea. I've had no contact with him and haven't talked to him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that that means you are a target? COMEY: I can't imagine that I'm a target. I saw the news report that John Brennan was a witness. Given that I know what happened during 2016, which was a bunch of people trying to do the right thing consistent with the law, I'm not worried at all about that investigation of the investigation. Next, I'm sure will be an investigation of the investigation of the investigation. They just want to have an investigation to talk about. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a tweet you sent this week. You sent out a picture of yourself wearing a t-shirt that said more women should be elected, more votes for women. Of course, it is the week honoring ratification of the 19th Amendment. But it drew this response that we just put up for our viewers from Hillary Clinton, who is just sort of making a smirk. I know she's said in the past that she thought she was on the verge of winning in 2016 until you reopened that email investigation. Do you see this as contradictory? Do you regret what happened then? Because she clearly sees this as a contradiction for you to say now. COMEY: Yeah, look, I think it's pretty funny. And I get why she would send something like that. She's better at Twitter than I am. But I regret only being involved in the 2016 election. We were stuck, and I think we made the right decisions choosing between terrible options. And so I wasn't trying, nor was anybody else in the FBI trying to elect or not elect anyone. And I hope more women get elected to office. I'm proud of that shirt that my daughters and my wife gave me. And I think it's time for more women to be leaders in this country. We'll all be better off. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, we agree with you on that point. Thank you very much, Jim Comey, for your time. We will be right back.",

            "article_content": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, one of Vladimir Putin's fiercest critics, lay in a coma Friday at a Siberian hospital after what his allies said appeared to be a poisoning engineered by the Kremlin.\u00a0 The 44-year-old Navalny fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tomsk on Thursday and was taken to a hospital after the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk, Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, said on Twitter.\u00a0She told the Echo Moskvy radio station that he must have consumed poison in tea he drank at an airport cafe before boarding the plane early Thursday. During the flight, Navalny started sweating and asked her to talk to him so that he could \"focus on the sound of a voice.\" He then went to the bathroom and lost consciousness, and has been in a coma and on a ventilator in grave condition ever since.\u00a0Navalny's organization is scrambling to make arrangements to transfer him to Germany for treatment. A German group said it was ready to send a plane for him and that a noted hospital in Berlin was ready to treat him. In a video statement released early Friday in Omsk, Yarmysh said Navalny remained in critical condition. She called on the hospital's leadership \"not to obstruct us from providing all necessary documents for his transfer.\"\u00a0 Other opposition figures were quick to suggest Kremlin involvement.\u00a0\"We are sure that the only people that have the capability to target Navalny or myself are Russian security services with definite clearance from Russia's political leadership,\" Pyotr Verzilov, a member of the protest group Pussy Riot who ended up in intensive care\u00a0after a suspected poisoning in 2018, told The Associated Press. \"We believe that Putin definitely is a person who gives that go-ahead in this situation.\"\u00a0Jaka Bizilj, of the German organization that arranged for Verzilov's treatment in Germany, said that at Verzilov's request \"we will send at midnight an air ambulance with medical equipment and specialists with which Navalny can be brought to Germany.\"\u00a0Omsk is about 2,500 miles east of Berlin, roughly a six-hour flight.\u00a0Doctors at Omsk Ambulance Hospital No. 1, where the politician was being treated, remained tight-lipped about his diagnosis, saying only that they were considering a variety of theories, including poisoning. Local health officials said they found no indication that Navalny had suffered from a heart attack, stroke or the coronavirus. Authorities initially refused to let Navalny's wife, Yulia, see her husband and have rejected requests for documentation that would allow him to be transferred to a European hospital for treatment, Yarmysh said.\u00a0Verzilov, who was flown to Berlin for treatment in 2018, said hospitals in Omsk or Moscow would not be able to treat Navalny properly and expressed concern about possible pressure from security services that doctors could be under in Russia.\u00a0Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was necessary to wait for test results showing what caused Navalny's condition, adding the authorities would consider a request to allow Navalny to leave Russia, which has not fully opened its borders after a coronavirus lockdown, for treatment. Reports about the alleged poisoning made waves in the West.\u00a0French President Emmanuel Macron said France was ready to offer Navalny and his family \"all necessary assistance ... in terms of health care, asylum, protection\" and insisted on the need to clarify what happened. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and the United Nations also expressed concern over what happened to Navalny, and Amnesty International demanded a full and thorough investigation.\u00a0\u00a0Like many other opposition politicians in Russia, Navalny has been frequently detained by law enforcement and harassed by pro-Kremlin groups. In 2017, he was attacked by several men who threw antiseptic in his face, damaging an eye.\u00a0Last year, Navalny was rushed to a hospital from prison, where he was serving a sentence following an administrative arrest, with what his team said was suspected poisoning. Doctors said he had a severe allergic attack and discharged him back to prison the following day. Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption has been exposing graft among government officials, including some at the highest level. Last month, he had to shut the foundation after a financially devastating lawsuit from Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to the Kremlin. Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko accused Navalny last week of organizing unprecedented mass protests against his re-election that have rocked Russia's ex-Soviet neighbor since August 9. He did not, however, provide any evidence and that claim was one of many blaming foreign forces for the unrest.\u00a0The most prominent member of Russia's opposition, Navalny campaigned to challenge Putin in the 2018 presidential election, but was barred from running.\u00a0He set up campaign offices across Russia and has been promoting opposition candidates in regional elections, challenging members of Russia's ruling party, United Russia. One of his associates in Khabarovsk, a city in Russia's Far East that has been engulfed in mass protests against the arrest of the region's governor, was detained last week after calling for a strike at a rally. In the interview with Echo Moskvy, Yarmysh said she believed the suspected poisoning was connected to this year's regional election campaign.\u00a0Commentators say Navalny has become increasingly dangerous for the Kremlin as Putin's approval rating has plummeted to a record low of around 60% amid the coronavirus pandemic and growing public frustration with the declining economy.\u00a0Navalny's ability to mobilize voters against pro-Kremlin candidates poses a particular challenge ahead of the 2021 parliamentary elections, said Abbas Gallyamov, a former Kremlin speechwriter-turned-political-analyst.\u00a0\"The Duma elections are particularly important for the Kremlin,\" as the new Duma will be operating in 2024, when Putin's current presidential term expires and he may announce running for re-election, Gallyamov told the AP.\u00a0\"That's why controlling the next State Duma is crucially important for the Kremlin. Navalny really makes it harder for the Kremlin to establish that control,\" Gallyamov added.\u00a0At the same time, Navalny, who rose to prominence by exposing corruption all over Russia, could have other enemies, Gallyamov said, and may have been targeted by people featured in one of his investigations, if he was indeed deliberately poisoned.\u00a0On Thursday evening, activists in several Russian cities held protests in support of Navalny. In St. Petersburg, a crowd of about 100 people gathered in the city center, and several supporters were detained.",

With the national movement over the deaths of\u00a0George Floyd,\u00a0Breonna Taylor,\u00a0Ahmaud Arbery\u00a0and\u00a0Rayshard Brooks, many black residents in D.C. feel not having statehood or proper representation has also been highlighted. \"For decades, racist accusations about District residents not being able to govern ourselves were used to deny us the rights that every other taxpaying American is guaranteed by the Constitution. Still today, without any senators and with no vote in Congress, we are denied full access to our nation's democracy,\" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. Republicans argue the vote is a political attempt by Democrats to grow their ranks, and both the Senate leadership and the White House have said they will not take the bill up. \"D.C. will never be a state,\" President Trump told the New York Post in May. \"Why? So we can have two more Democratic \u2014 Democrat senators and five more congressmen? No, thank you. That'll never happen.\"\u00a0 JOE BIDEN At his handful of small, socially-distanced campaign events Joe Biden has made not just policy but pandemic protection an issue of contrast between himself and President Donald Trump,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports.\u00a0 In an interview with CBS Pittsburgh affiliate KDKA, Biden said if he were president today he would \"do everything possible\" to use the power of the federal government to require that everyone wear a face mask while in public. \"The one thing we do know is that these masks make a gigantic difference,\" Biden said in the interview. But he mentioned one time in the near future he would potentially not wear a mask: his inauguration. If elected and health conditions call for face masks, Biden said the regular ceremony on the steps of the U.S. Capitol could potentially be re-worked with social distancing. But before Biden marks up his inauguration plans, he of course has to win the November presidential election in 130 days. Biden picked up endorsements from two people connected to the historic cases paving the way for the legalization of same-sex marriage five years ago, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. \"We won that fight for the freedom to marry because of an ally in the White House, Joe Biden,\" Jim Obergefell and Judith Kasen-Windsor said in a joint statement given to CBS News, calling Biden the LGBTQ community's \"greatest ally.\" Obergefell was the plaintiff in the historic 2015 case that made gay marriage legal and Karen-Windsor is the widow to the plaintiff whose case in 2013 rendered the Defense Against Marriage Act illegal. \"He is the leader our country needs so desperately right now, someone who can bridge the divides that Donald Trump has worked so hard to dredge,\" Obergefell and Kasen-Windsor wrote.\u00a0 \u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP The White House announced a last-minute change to Mr. Trump's travel plans Friday, canceling the president's weekend trip to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"UPDATE: The President will no longer be traveling to Bedminster, NJ,\" a one line statement from the White House read. Travelers to New Jersey, New York and Connecticut from COVID hot spots have been instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days. As of Friday, those states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Utah. Mr. Trump traveled this week to Arizona to check on construction progress on the southern border wall and attend a campaign event at a Phoenix megachurch. But asked if the president canceled his weekend getaway on the heels of a trip to Arizona in order to abide by New Jersey travel restrictions, White House spokesman Judd Deere responded, \"It had nothing to do with that.\" In a press conference Friday, Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey declared \"the president is deemed to be on the essential workforce category.\"\u00a0 He continued \"and therefore, he is welcome to New Jersey. So there was no either private or public signal from us otherwise.\" The U.S. reached an all-time daily high of 40,000 COVID-19 cases on Friday, surpassing a record set in April. As a result, governors in states including Texas are halting efforts to reopen the economy. \"We're making a lot of progress with the whole situation that came in from a place called China,\" Mr. Trump said about the pandemic before a roundtable on federal hiring practices. \"We have a little work to do and we'll get it done,\" Mr. Trump added. Amid the spike in coronavirus cases, voter disapproval of Mr. Trump's job performance is at an all-time high, an\u00a0NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released on Friday. Mr. Trump's approval rating sits at 40% overall. A whopping 58% disapprove, with a record-breaking 49% of surveyed voters indicating they \"strongly disapprove\" of the job Trump is doing.\u00a0 Biden leads Mr. Trump by 8 percentage points, 52% to 44%, in the general election matchup. Vice President Mike Pence held the first Coronavirus Task Force press briefing in nearly two months, saying \"we slowed the spread, we flattened the curve,\" despite the U.S. reaching a record new number of COVID-19 cases for a single day.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says the 40,000 new cases registered Friday is also a dramatic rise from May when the new cases hovered around 25,000 a day and early June when the average was roughly 20,000 per day. Pence said there are 16 states seeing an increase in cases and positive percentage rates. Roughly half of the new cases are Americans under the age of 35, which Pence said is an encouraging sign. Over the next few days, Pence is set to travel to states hit hardest by recent spikes. On Sunday, Pence will visit Dallas. Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Friday ordered bars to close and starting Monday, restaurants must operate at 50% capacity, a roll back from 75%. Next week, Pence is set to make trips to Arizona and Florida. The vice president said Friday that he will be traveling to these states \"to get a ground report,\" but he will also be campaigning for reelection. The Trump campaign recently announced Pence will make remarks in Tucson, Arizona, and Sarasota, Florida, as part of his \"Faith in America\" tour, which the vice president kicked off this this week in Wisconsin. Asked about campaigning as cases continue to rise, Pence talked about taking the \"proper steps\" like screening at events and \"giving people the very best counsel\" on safety precautions. But Pence acknowledged that \"we have an election coming up this fall,\" adding that he and the president \"still want to give people the freedom to participate in the political process.\" The Trump campaign, despite pleas from local officials to postpone, went ahead with a large indoor rally in Oklahoma last week, which resulted in dozens of campaign staffers and U.S. Secret Service members being forced to quarantine after some tested positive for the coronavirus.\u00a0 CALIFORNIA California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a budget emergency on Thursday as the state faces a deficit of more than $54 billion because of the response to the coronavirus.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0writes\u00a0the announcement came a day after Newsom threatened to withhold $2.5 billion in the upcoming budget from local governments if they don't comply with the state's order on masks, testing and other measures in place to slow the spread of COVID-19. While the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) refers to rules for wearing masks as \"guidance,\" Newsom's executive order from mid-March allows the state to enforce the public health rules. Newsom has said \"we are now at a stage in this pandemic where we have to demand more accountability\" and \"that is why we are attaching $2.5 billion dollars to that pledge.\" Newsom said his approach \"is to be guided by enforcement at the local level first\" but made clear he has tools at his disposal to ensure that local governments are complying with public health guidelines, including the requirement to wear masks in public. The governor said he doesn't want Californians to be fined for not wearing a mask and said enforcement of it could be done on a case-by-case basis like jaywalking. FLORIDA The Florida Department of Health reported 8,942 new positive COVID-19 cases on Friday \u2014 the state's largest single-day increase \u2014 bringing the total number of cases in the state to nearly 123,000, with more than 3,000 related deaths. According to data provided by the FLDOH, the increase in cases also tracks with an increase in the number of people being tested per day. The department received COVID-19 lab results for more than 71,000 people throughout the state on Thursday. As of Friday, residents ages 25-34 years old accounted for more than 23,000 case, which is 19% of the total number of confirmed cases in the state. According to a New York Times coronavirus case count tracker, Florida has the sixth-highest number of cases in the country.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that during a press conference with health experts on Friday, Governor Ron DeSantis said that he won't mandate face masks throughout the state and that this type of order \"wouldn't make sense\" in some cities. \"The idea that you're just going to mandate and selectively prosecute people, I don't think that that's necessarily going to work. I do think what will work is consistent messaging, letting people know what they can do to help protect themselves, and protect others,\" said DeSantis. \"Some localities require [face masks] and they're going to have to figure out how they're going to use\u2026the long arm of the law to enforce it.\" On Friday, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation suspended on-site consumption of alcohol at bars across the state, days after the governor\u00a0warned there would be \"no tolerance\" for businesses that don't follow the\u00a0mandated 50% indoor occupancy rule as outlined in the current phase of re-opening. Earlier this week, the DBPR\u00a0issued an emergency suspension of the alcoholic beverage license of a bar in Orlando after 13 employees and at least 28 patrons tested positive for COVID-19.",

            "article_content": "The bluest congressional district in the U.S. is located in the Bronx in New York City, bordering famous liberal Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's district. But among the 12 contenders vying for the open congressional seat, one of the top contenders is a conservative Democrat Reverend Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Sr., a polarizing city councilman with a history of endorsing Republicans and making homophobic comments. D\u00edaz Sr. is known for wearing a cowboy hat and courting controversy. He resisted calls to resign last year after saying the New York City Council was \"controlled by the homosexual community,\" although the committee he led was dissolved. D\u00edaz Sr. has proclaimed himself to be \"the opposite of AOC.\" In 2011, D\u00edaz Sr. held a rally against same-sex marriage while his granddaughter held a dueling event in support of it across the street. He voted against legalizing same-sex marriage in 2009 and in 2011, when the measure was successful. He has compared abortion to the Holocaust and said \"murderers, assassins and criminals are pro-choice.\" D\u00edaz Sr. did not respond to requests for an interview by CBS News. \"There's a real risk that a Trump Republican masquerading as a Democrat could represent the bluest district in America,\" said New York City Councilman Ritchie Torres, one of D\u00edaz's main rivals in the race. Hillary Clinton won the congressional district by over 93% in 2016. A poll by the liberal think tank Data for Progress conducted in May found D\u00edaz Sr. leading the field of Democratic candidates with 22% support, followed closely by Torres. Torres was the youngest person elected to the city council in 2014, and the first openly gay person to be elected to higher office in the Bronx. In an interview with CBS News, Torres painted the primary as a two-person race between himself and D\u00edaz Sr. \"We have a historic opportunity to have a new generation of leadership, and we have a historic opportunity to retire the politics of hate and fear,\" Torres said, adding that the election of D\u00edaz Sr. \"would be one of the greatest tragedies of 2020.\" Torres has been endorsed by The New York Times, and several national progressive groups like the Human Rights Campaign. The Times endorsement of Torres said D\u00edaz Sr. \"talks and acts like a pro-Trump Republican.\" Although he has frequently railed against same-sex marriage and abortion, D\u00edaz Sr. has insisted that his opposition is based in his religious beliefs and not bigotry. The Puerto Rican-born D\u00edaz Sr. is the pastor of a Pentecostal church in the Bronx. Torres argued that D\u00edaz Sr. has an \"irreducible base of evangelical support.\" D\u00edaz Sr. entered politics in 1993, when he was confirmed by the city council to serve on the police civilian complaint review board. He has endorsed Republicans Rudy Giuliani, George Pataki and Rick Lazio, Clinton's opponent in her 2000 run for Senate. He has more recently invited President Trump to attend his church and Senator Ted Cruz to visit his district. D\u00edaz Sr. served as a state senator before being elected to the council in 2017. The South Bronx is filled with buildings bearing the Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz name, such as Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Apartments and Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Plaza. His son, Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Jr., is the popular Bronx borough president. D\u00edaz Jr. has not endorsed his father, and has previously distanced himself from D\u00edaz Sr.'s more controversial comments. However, the two have frequently appeared together in recent days, including handing out food boxes to Bronx residents on June 5. The 15th Congressional District is one of the poorest in the country, with a median income of $30,000 and nearly 34% of people living below the poverty line. Bronx United, a political action committee that opposes D\u00edaz Sr., has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission earlier this month, alleging that Diaz Sr. knowingly accepted \"illegal corporate contributions\" by distributing food provided by Fresh Direct to the city borough presidents outside his city council district but within congressional district. D\u00edaz Sr. has denied that he was campaigning. \"As a pro-Trump, anti-choice, anti-LGBT politician who has spent his entire ineffective career boosting Republicans like Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin and Rudy Giuliani, Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Sr. should not bring his traveling circus to Washington. At a time when we need dynamic leadership, D\u00edaz Sr.'s bizarre antics and extreme views would hurt the South Bronx and New York City,\" a spokesman for Bronx United said in a statement to CBS News. D\u00edaz Sr. may also benefit from being listed on the ballot as \"Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz,\" with no junior or senior modifier, meaning that some people may be unsure of which Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz they are supporting. \"I think the fact that he's on the ballot as 'Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz,' he's trying to confuse people,\" said Assemblyman Michael Blake, another candidate in the race. \"He absolutely is competitive, you can't ignore that, but like any campaign you have to tell your own story.\" Blake, who is also the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, has the support of several influential local unions. Blake has also been endorsed by the political arm of the Congressional Black Caucus. Ocasio-Cortez and the Democratic Socialists of America are supporting community activist Samelys L\u00f3pez. Other candidates include former city Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito; Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez; Chivona Newsome, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York; Tomas Ramos, a program director at Bronx River Community Center; and Frangell Basora, a former intern for Serrano. Having an open congressional seat in New York City is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for many young politicians, as several members of the New York delegation have been in the House for decades. Torres noted that several of the candidates in the primary, including Blake, ran for New York City public advocate, a position seen as a stepping stone to becoming mayor, in 2019. \"There are opportunistic elected officials who keep running for higher office,\" Torres said. He also argued that \"every insurgent thinks they are the reincarnation of AOC.\" Blake replied that \"people are going to vote for whoever they vote for,\" and said that his theme of 'Believe in the Bronx' is \"not just a one liner, it's a true mindset.\" Progressive candidates in neighboring congressional districts are gaining traction. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez in the 14th District, progressive candidate Jamaal Bowman is mounting a significant challenge to longtime incumbent Eliot Engel in the 16th Congressional District. In a region where winning the Democratic primary is tantamount to winning the election in November, whoever prevails in these contests could set the tone for the future of politics in New York City. \"You have the poorest congressional district, the most diverse district, and the most Democratic district all in one. And New York-15 can demonstrate to the country where we go as a country, especially in urban America,\" Blake said.

Varricchio said that President Trump \"is a friend of Italy,\" and added that \"we have been working with him very effectively.\" But he explained that the relationship between the U.S. and Italy goes beyond who is in office at any given moment. \"Our alliance goes beyond the different administrations,\" Varricchio said. \"This is something rock-solid important.\" Varricchio said that the high participation rate in the November election had sent a signal to the world about the strength of democracy. Mr. Biden received over 80 million votes, more than any other presidential candidate in history. \"The elections have sent a very important message to the world. When people decide to participate, take responsibility, sometimes being in line to cast a vote, a ballot. This is the soul of democracy, this shows to all who might cast doubt on the system that we cherish so much, that this is the best possible response,\" Varricchio said. Varricchio also noted that the incoming first lady, Jill Biden, is of Italian descent. \"The new first lady is Italian-American, so this is very important for my country,\" Varricchio said. He briefly talked about the strain of populism represented by Mr. Trump is also present Europe, but said it was a pattern of history. \"This is something that has always been there. A sort of pendulum between opening to the world while at the same time trying to retrench within borders. And this is true for Europe but this is true also for the United States,\" Varricchio said. Varricchio also talked about how the coronavirus pandemic has affected his country. Italy went into full lockdown in the spring for several weeks, and will do so again from December 24 to January 6 to mitigate spread during the holiday period. He said that he took pride in seeing pictures of empty cities during the spring lockdown, because it showed that people were taking the virus seriously. \"I've seen pictures taken of the beautiful historic Italian cities, from Rome, to Venice, to Milan, to Naples, completely silent and empty. This was something that was never experienced before,\" Varricchio said. \"We had to rediscover, in a way, ourselves, our communities, our families.\" However, he noted that \"it's in times of crisis that culture flourishes,\" giving the example of Boccaccio writing the Decameron during the plague in the 14th century. \"In a country blessed with this unique history and heritage like Italy, we have gone through many difficult times. And this has, in a way, shaped our resilience and shaped who we are,\" Varricchio said. \"We had in our DNA a strength, a resilience, to be aware that during difficult times we can stop and try to build and figure out a better future. I think this is the best lesson that we can draw from this terrible experience.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The Pentagon said Friday it is pulling most U.S. troops out of Somalia on President Trump's orders, continuing a post-election push by Mr. Trump to shrink U.S. involvement in counterterrorism missions abroad. Without providing details, the Pentagon said in a short statement that \"a majority\" of U.S. troops and assets in Somalia will be withdrawn in early 2021. There are currently about 700 troops in the Horn of Africa nation, training and advising local forces in an extended fight against the extremist group al-Shabab, an affiliate of al-Qaida. Trump recently ordered troop drawdowns in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he was expected to withdraw some or all troops from Somalia. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had said on Wednesday that the future structure of the U.S. military presence in Somalia was still being debated. The adjusted U.S. presence, Milley said, would amount to \"a relatively small footprint, relatively low cost in terms of number of personnel and in terms of money.\" He provided no specifics but stressed that the U.S. remained concerned about the threat posed by al-Shabab, which he called \"an extension of al-Qaida,\" the extremist group that planned the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States from Afghanistan. \"They do have some reach and they could if left unattended conduct operations against not only U.S. interests in the region but also against the homeland,\" he said. \"So they require attention.\" Noting that Somalia remains a dangerous place for Americans, he said that a CIA officer was killed there recently. The acting secretary of defense, Christopher Miller, made a brief visit to Somalia last week and met with U.S. troops. Depending on what remains of the U.S. presence in Somalia when he takes office January 20, President-elect Joe Biden could reverse Trump's drawdown or make other adjustments to reflect his counterterrorism priorities. The U.S. military also has a presence in neighboring Djibouti on the Bab al-Mandab Strait. Representative Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, criticized the Trump pullback in Somalia as a \"surrender to al-Qaida and a gift of China.\" Langevin is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee's Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. \"When U.S. forces leave Somalia in response to today's order, it becomes harder for diplomats and aid workers to help people resolve conflicts without violence and loss of life,\" Langevin said. \"With upcoming elections in Somalia and conflict raging in neighboring Ethiopia, abandoning our partners could not come at a worse time.\" Langevin said China will use the opportunity to build its influence in the Horn of Africa. The Pentagon said the drawdown in Somalia does not mark the end of U.S. counterterrorism efforts there. \"As a result of this decision, some forces may be reassigned outside of East Africa,\" it said. \"However, the remaining forces will be repositioned from Somalia into neighboring countries in order to allow cross-border operations by both U.S. and partner forces to maintain pressure against violent extremist organizations operating in Somalia.\" \"The U.S. will retain the capability to conduct targeted counterterrorism operations in Somalia, and collect early warnings and indicators regarding threats to the homeland,\" it added. The nature of the threat posed by al-Shabab and the appropriate U.S. response has been a matter of increasing debate in the Pentagon, which has been looking for opportunities to shift its focus toward China as a greater long-term challenge. A Defense Department watchdog report last week said U.S. Africa Command has seen a \"definitive shift\" this year in al-Shabab's focus to attack U.S. interests in the region. Africa Command says al-Shabab is Africa's most \"dangerous\" and \"imminent\" threat.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris are\u00a0meeting on Wednesday evening\u00a0in Salt Lake City, Utah, for the sole vice presidential debate, which will be moderated by USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be the top issue of the evening, especially since President Trump\u00a0tested positive for COVID-19 last week. Safety measures have been put in place for the debate at the University of Utah.\u00a0Here's more\u00a0on what to watch for\u00a0Wednesday night at 9 p.m\u00a0by\u00a0CBS News digital reporters Grace Segers\u00a0and\u00a0Audrey\u00a0McNamara. Pence participated in three separate 90-minute practice sessions ahead of the debate, according to a senior White House official. Trump campaign advisor and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi - who has been helping Pence prepare for today's debate by playing Harris - called the U.S. senator from California \"a great debater\" on Fox News, Wednesday. \"I know Kamala. She's smart. She's articulate. She is very tough,\" Bondi said. Asked how Pence plans to defend his record as leader of the White House coronavirus task force, Bondi said she had not spoken directly with the vice president about it, but added: \"Off the top of my head, what I would say is, well, you're the one that called us xenophobic for wanting to shut down China's entry. You're the one who wants open borders, so people can just flow into this country with diseases, with human trafficking, with drugs. So I mean, there's plenty to come back.\" During a phone call with reporters ahead of the debate, Harris' communications director Liz Allen said, \"Senator Harris will be on stage with Mike Pence,\" but added, \"this debate is really about Trump's failed leadership.\" Members of Harris' team signaled that the senator from California will lean in heavily on the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic as the vice president himself is the head of the White House COVID-19 task force, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders did stress to reporters that they are expecting Pence to have a good night. Sanders said Pence has a \"history\" of being a successful debater and they do not see Wednesday night as an exception. Members of Harris' team were asked about any concerns they might have about any potential exposure to COVID-19 that Harris might face herself while on stage, especially as Harris is set to return to the campaign trail tomorrow with an appearance with her running mate Joe Biden in Arizona. Both Sanders and Allen said their team and Harris will continue to follow the guidelines set by the Cleveland Clinic and the Commission on Presidential Debates. Pence has agreed to a plexiglass barrier on his side of the debate stage after earlier objections to the separation,\u00a0Perry\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter\u00a0Nicole\u00a0Sganga\u00a0report. The concession from representatives of the Trump-Pence campaign came after\u00a0wrangling over whether plexiglass was needed\u00a0on Pence's side of the stage. Despite the extra COVID-19 safety measures in place, one doctor is questioning whether that will be enough as the virus outbreak at the White House continues to grow. \"More layers of protection are so important,\" Dr. Neeta Ogden said on\u00a0CBSN\u00a0Wednesday. \"It's not just Pence, it's the team that he's traveling with, it's the exposure on a daily basis.\" The vice president's physician announced that Pence took a PCR coronavirus test Tuesday afternoon that came back negative. And the White House said Pence and his wife both tested negative again Wednesday in Salt Lake City, where the debate is being held. But as Ogden points out, test results only reflect a specific moment in time and don't guarantee an infection won't develop later. \"Just because he's had a daily antigen test, intermittent PCR tests, is meaningless if he continues to interact with other people on his team or anybody else in the world -- we don't know what their COVID status is,\" she said.\u00a0Sganga\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News White House producer Sara Cooke\u00a0report the Trump campaign has not learned of any additional positive coronavirus tests within their ranks since Friday night, when the president's campaign manager Bill Stepien announced he tested positive for the virus. The president's sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and daughter-in-law Lara Trump tested negative on Monday for COVID-19. Mr. Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday, a White House spokesperson confirmed to\u00a0CBS News White House producer Gaby Ake. White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern told the TV pool the president was briefed on ongoing coronavirus stimulus talks and Hurricane Delta. Morgenstern told reporters on Wednesday that it's not possible to uncover the source of Mr. Trump's coronavirus infection,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports. \"I understand people are very curious about that. I'm curious too. But that's not really what contact tracing does. And the fact is, it could be any number of sources,\" Morgenstern said. \"It's sort of an unknowable question as to where it entered the environment. Conley, the president's physician, has repeatedly declined to provide specifics about the president's lung condition or the last time Mr. Trump tested negative for the virus, citing federal privacy laws. On Monday afternoon, Conley released a new memo providing an update on Mr. Trump's health. \"The president this morning says 'I feel great!'\" wrote Conley, who has been leading the president's care. \"His physical exam and vital signs, including oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, all remain stable and in normal range.\" Conley said Mr. Trump has been fever-free for four days and has not shown any symptoms for over 24 hours, adding that the president \"has not needed nor received any supplemental oxygen since initial hospitalization.\" He also said tests on Monday showed the president has \"detectable levels\" of coronavirus antibodies, an improvement from last Thursday, when antibodies were undetectable. Mr. Trump received a dose of an\u00a0experimental antibody cocktail\u00a0developed by the company Regeneron early on in his care, a drug that is not widely available. Gwinnett County, the second largest county in Georgia by population with more than 900,000 residents, has seen exponential growth in the past decade with the population growing by more than 100,000 and diversifying among racial and ethnic groups. Since 2010, the number of African-American, Asian, and Hispanic residents in the county has grown by tens of thousands, a demographic shift that one University of Georgia political science professor described as a \"racial change\" that is evident in the fact that you can drive through Gwinnett and \"see signs in all languages.\" Cathy Cox was the first woman to serve as Georgia's Secretary of State when she took office in 1999. Cox told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that if a Democrat wants to win the state of Georgia -- which hasn't happened in a presidential election since Bill Clinton won in 1992 -- they must do well in Gwinnett County. \"It has been a perennial Republican county until the last 10 or 15 years when the demographics have shifted radically as immigrant communities have moved into the county, grown businesses, and now the population is trending very heavily Democratic,\" said Cox. \"That shift has caught a lot of people by surprise and it now has become truly a solid Democratic voting base, when Republicans used to not have to bat an eye to count on that as part of their tally.\" In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the suburban county outside of Atlanta by just 5%, but it was the first time in more than 20 years that a Democrat had won Gwinnett County in a presidential election -- a sign that Cox said shows the area has become more of a Democratic safety net. \"Democrats have always been able to count on Fulton County, DeKalb County, Richmond County in Augusta, Chatham County in Savannah, but now Gwinnett County is absolutely being added to that column.\" CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0was first to report that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) War Room will be trolling the vice president in the hours leading up to the event with mobile billboards attacking him on his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic as attention focuses on Salt Lake City, Utah, where Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris will debate Wednesday night. \"As chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Pence owns the administration's failed response to the pandemic more than anyone except Trump himself.\" Lily Adams, DNC War Room senior spokesperson and adviser, said in a statement to CBS News. \"As cases continue to rise across the country and millions of families struggle to make ends meet, Americans are owed answers tonight on the administration's failed coronavirus response.\" To date, over 7 million Americans have contracted the virus and more than 210,000 Americans have died - statistics that will certainly be highlighted on the billboards, which will also feature audio of Mr. Trump naming Pence head of the task force during the onset of the pandemic. Another billboard highlights the Trump administration's efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act and the protections afforded to people with preexisting conditions. A case on the nation's health care law will be heard by the Supreme Court in the same week as the election in November.\u00a0For more on this click\u00a0here. With less than a month to go before November 3, Facebook announced additional measures it will take surrounding the 2020 election in what is expected to be an unprecedented election year. While the social network already had a plan in place to hit pause on new political and issue ads the week before the election,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0reports it announced Thursday they will be removing all political, electoral and social issue ads when polls close on November 3, in an effort to reduce confusion and abuse. \"Advertisers can expect this to last for a week, though this is subject to change,\" said Sarah Schiff, product lead for political advertising at Facebook on a call with reporters. In a year where it could take time before multiple races are decided, Facebook is also working on labels and how they will be applied to election results. Once polls close, Facebook plans to run a notification at the top of Facebook and Instagram and apply labels to candidate posts that direct viewers to the network's Voting Information Center on the vote counting process. Labels will include notifications that counting is still taking place and a winner has not yet been determined should a candidate or party declare victory in a race before it's called by a major media outlet. Meanwhile, if a candidate or party contests a race already called by a major media outlet, Facebook will show the name of the declared winner and link to the Voting Information Center for more details in an effort to combat confusion. At the same time, Facebook said it will now remove calls for people to engage in poll watching when such calls use militarized language or suggest the goal is to \"intimidate, exert control, or display power over election officials or voters.\" This measure is in addition to steps already in place to remove calls for coordinated interference or bringing weapons to polling places. \"What we're trying to do now is get to this more implicit speech,\" said vice president for content policy Monika Bickert, whose team will be making the enforcement decisions on the effort. Bickert noted that while this is a policy moving forward, Facebook will not be going back to retroactively remove old posts. A new batch of polling shows Biden leading Mr. Trump in several key battleground states, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. According to new\u00a0Quinnipiac University\u00a0polls, Biden is leading Mr. Trump 51% to 40% in Florida, Biden is up 54% to 41% in Pennsylvania and Biden is leading Mr. Trump 50% to 45% in Iowa. In Florida, Biden was up 3 points in Quinnipiac polling in early September and in Pennsylvania, Biden was up 8 points in early September. It was the first Quinnipiac poll to survey likely voters in Iowa. The poll also showed Iowa Democratic Senate candidate Theresa Greenfield leading Republican incumbent Joni Ernst 50% to 45%. Separately, in Wisconsin, a new\u00a0Marquette University Law School\u00a0poll showed Biden leading Trump 46% to 41% among likely voters. The Marquette poll also found that 54% of Wisconsinites are planning to vote in-person on Election Day, up from 50% back in late August and early September. Biden still holds leads among voters planning to vote absentee, either by mail or in-person, and Trump leads among voters who plan to go to the polls on Election Day. The Marquette poll also found that 72% of respondents support a statewide mask order, which Democratic Governor Tony Evers recently extended, as the state faces a major COVID-19 outbreak. A conservative legal group challenged that order and Republicans in the state legislature filed a brief supporting that challenge, saying Evers didn't have the power to do so. It's been three years since Hurricane Maria ravaged the island of Puerto Rico, leaving thousands dead and others displaced, seeking shelter in cities like Orlando, Florida. Today, more than a million Puerto Ricans live in Florida, many of them in Kissimmee, where one of the key issues in the 2020 election will be Puerto Rico's recovery efforts.\u00a0CBS News LaCrai\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reports\u00a0that 27 days from the presidential election, Puerto Rican communities are organizing in Florida as both presidential candidates are actively appealing to this voting bloc. In September, just a few days after the Biden-Harris campaign announced a proposal to provide more infrastructure funding to help Puerto Rico rebuild, Mr. Trump announced nearly $13 billion would go to the island for recovery efforts three years after the storm hit. But many feel that this gesture is too little, too late. \"I'm voting for Biden. Is he perfect? No, he's not. But I'm voting for Biden because we cannot stand another four years of what we got,\" said Frank Rivera, one of many volunteers who has helped Puerto Rican families settle in Central Florida. \"You cannot be humiliated, you cannot be put down by the administration and then turn around and give us $13 billion and think that that is enough to wipe everything clean.\"\u00a0Read the full story\u00a0here. The Franklin County Board of Elections announced Tuesday evening that some voters in the county received incorrect ballots via mail, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. In an updated statement on Wednesday, the board, who is working with the software vendor Bluecrest and the Ohio Secretary of State's office to correct the issue, said they are still analyzing how many voters received incorrect ballots. \"The Board tested the system that was responsible for incorrect ballots,\" the board added in a statement. \"The system is now working as intended. Voters that received the wrong ballot will be issued a new correct replacement ballot. That ballot will be mailed out in the coming days.\" If the presidential race is close in Pennsylvania, it could take days, but not weeks, to know who won, the state's top elections official said. \"Every time we've had a close race, it sometimes takes days until you know who the winner is,\" Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar said on a press call today. \"But I think the overwhelming majority of ballots cast in person and cast by mail will be able to be counted in a matter of days, not a matter of weeks.\" Boockvar and local elections officials have long been\u00a0asking\u00a0to be allowed to begin pre-canvassing mail ballots ahead of Election Day, but the governor and state legislature haven't come to an agreement on legislation that would do so, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. The state Supreme Court last month also extended the deadline for mail ballots to arrive at elections offices to three days after the election, allowing for further delays. Official results aren't due until 20 days after the election. Boockvar also said nearly 9 million Pennsylvanians have registered to vote in the state's general election, a number her office believes to be a record. Democrats still vastly outnumber Republicans here, but by about 200,000\u00a0fewer\u00a0registered voters than in 2016. Boockvar also said over 60 of the state's 67 counties have already begun mailing mail-in ballots or will in the coming days. Over 92,000 ballots have already been returned. About three dozen counties are using drop boxes for some mail ballots returns, but most have five or less, Boockvar said. About a half dozen have opened or plan to open satellite election offices where voters can register, apply for a mail ballot, fill it out and return it in a single trip. The Texas Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a challenge from Republican leaders in the state seeking to strike down an extended early voting period, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. In July, Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced there would be an extra 6 days of early voting in Texas and allowed people to hand deliver mail ballots before Election Day. Abbott had resisted calls to expand voting by mail access, but instead offered the extra 6 days of early voting. The Texas Supreme Court said Republicans challenged the decision too late and noted that the election is already happening. Early voting is set to begin in Texas on October 13. According to CBS News\u00a0data, 61% of likely voters in Texas plan to vote early in person. The combination of intense interest in the 2020 presidential election with a deadly pandemic is spurring sky-high rates of early voting. That's going to have an impact on the way election night plays out this year, but it won't affect the outcome\u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News Election & Survey Unit's Kabir Khanna. So far,\u00a0over 5 million voters have already cast their ballots, and many more intend to do so in the coming weeks. Some will vote by mail, while others will do so in person at early voting centers. (Check out ways of voting in your state\u00a0here.) We've been asking voters in battleground states how they would prefer to vote this year. In six competitive states that CBS has polled over the past 3 weeks, each state, a sizable segment of likely voters tell us they would prefer to vote by mail or in person -- before Election Day, which falls on November 3. In states with strong track records of early voting -- like Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas -- large majorities prefer to vote by mail or early in person, ranging from 68% to 80%. Even in Pennsylvania, where early voting has been much less common, 36% want to vote by mail, with a narrower 57% majority saying they would like to vote in person on Election Day. In addition to the sheer magnitude of early voting this year, there's an interesting pattern emerging: Democrats look much likelier to vote early, particularly by mail, than Republicans do. This pattern appears in survey data and actual ballot returns. In North Carolina, for instance, registered Democrats are returning mail ballots at substantially higher rates than registered Republicans are. In fact, most of the ballots returned in the state so far are from Democrats. By contrast, Republican voters are much likelier to express a preference for voting in person on Election Day. This difference is partly attributable to cues from party leaders, like Mr. Trump's baseless\u00a0claims\u00a0that mail voting is fraudulent. Despite the president's rhetoric, around nine in 10 Republicans who usually vote by mail want to do so again (much as Mr. Trump does himself). While most Trump voters prefer to vote as they usually do, many Biden voters want to change how they vote this year. In fact, it's Democrats who are driving the partisan gaps in vote method by switching from Election Day to early voting. Many Biden voters say they usually vote in person on Election Day but fewer want to do so this year. The differences here are substantially larger than they are among Trump voters. In Pennsylvania, for example, just 35% say they prefer to vote on Election Day this year, compared to 82% who say they usually vote that way. In four of the five other states, the percentage for \"this year\" is less than half the \"usually\" percentage. What this all means for election night is that is that we're likely to see substantial differences in the early and Election-Day vote. Partisan splits may be even larger in states where early voting is historically less common, like Ohio and Pennsylvania. In states that process early ballots before election night and therefore report their results more quickly on election night -- like Florida and North Carolina -- Biden may appear to do better in the early returns. In states like Pennsylvania -- where many counties will not even report mail votes on election night -- Trump may appear to be ahead as counties begin releasing results. Fortunately, we'll be tracking all of this data at the\u00a0CBS News Decision Desk. Rather than rely solely on the tabulated votes at any given point in the night, our models estimate where the race will end up when all the votes are in. We'll be estimating the total number of early ballots and outstanding ballots in each state, and our exit polls will include interviews at early vote centers, as well as phone interviews with voters who cast mail ballots. But we will not project a winner in a state until we're confident the trailing candidate won't catch up even after all ballots -- whether cast in person or by mail, early or on Election Day -- are counted. NORTH CAROLINA The Army Reserve confirmed to CBS News Wednesday that it is investigating the matters involving Lieutenant Colonel James \"Cal\" Cunningham, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. On Friday, Cunningham's campaign confirmed the authenticity of flirtatious text messages between Cunningham and a political strategist, and since then, the AP has uncovered more text messages that show the relationship was recent and included intimate encounters. In his first interview since news of the text broke last Friday, Cunningham told CBS affiliate WNCN that he has hurt his family and disappointed his supporters, but the Senate race is about issues affecting North Carolinians, not his personal life, and wouldn't answer questions about his relationship. He said he will cooperate with the Army Reserve investigation and answer any questions they might have. On the other side, incumbent Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who received a positive COVID-19 test on Friday, told WRAL he \"made a mistake taking off mask inside the White House.\" Tillis attended the nomination ceremony of Judge Amy Coney Barrett on September 26, and while he wore a mask outside, he took it off at the indoor reception.",

            "article_content": "The power of the president is enormous \u2013 and this president is not bashful in describing powers that go well beyond simple declarations.\u00a0 In April, when discussing guidelines to be issued to governors about reopening states during the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump said, \"When somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total, and that's the way it's got to be \u2013 it's total.\" There are, it's true, some restraints on most presidential authority, but those might not apply to all the president's powers. As Mr. Trump stated in March, \"I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.\" We can't know for sure, but what the president appears to have been referring to are his presidential emergency action documents, often referred to as PEADs.  \"Even though I've had security clearances for the better part of 50 years and been in and out of national security matters during that half-century, I had never heard of these 'secret powers,'\" said former Senator Gary Hart.  \"Sunday Morning\" special contributor Ted Koppel asked, \"Do you know what they are, now that you've heard of them?\" \"Only vaguely, due to research done at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School,\" Hart said. \"What these secret powers are, apparently, based on the research, is suspension of the Constitution, basically. And that's what's worrying, particularly on the eve of a national election.\"  The Brennan Center research that Senator Hart referred to has been spearheaded by Elizabeth Goitein, the co-director of its national security program, and a contributing writer at The Atlantic. \"These are essentially presidential orders that are drafted in anticipation of a range of hypothetical, worst-case scenarios,\" Goitein said.  Koppel asked, \"Several times during his administration, President Trump has made allusions to secret powers that he has that we don't know about. Is he making that up?\" \"Well, not exactly,\" Goitein replied. \"And what's alarming about that is that no one really knows what the limits of those claimed authorities might be, because they are often developed and kept in secret.\" Goitein says what little we do know about PEADs comes from references to them in other documents, some of which are now declassified.  \"They originated in the Eisenhower administration as part of an effort to try to plan for a potential Soviet nuclear attack,\" Goitein said. \"But since then, they've expanded to address other types of emergencies as well. No presidential emergency action document has even been released, or even leaked. Not even Congress has access to them, which is really pretty extraordinary when you consider that even the most highly-classified covert military and intelligence operations have to be reported to at least eight Members of Congress, the 'Gang of Eight.'\" \"You're saying they are not consulting with Congress?\" Koppel asked.  \"Exactly,\" said Goitein. \"Congress is not aware of these documents, and from public sources we know that at least in the past these documents have purported to do things that are not permitted by the Constitution \u2013 things like martial law and the suspension of habeas corpus and the roundup and detention of people not suspected of any crime.\" Hart said, \"The reason these documents are secret is, for 11 administrations, people in power did not want to frighten the American people, or to demonstrate what might happen to their constitutional rights and liberties. \"Every administration, including Democratic administrations, has revised and updated these powers. I started contacting friends of mine, of both parties, who had been in senior positions, and I got two responses, or one response which is, 'I've never heard of these powers' (and these are people in senior cabinet positions), or, I got no response at all. And it was the no-response-at-all from people I knew that began to worry me. Because there not only is secrecy around these powers, there is mystery around the secrecy.\" \"I think I know as much about the PEADs as any other American citizen, which is almost nothing at all,\" said David Cole, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union \u2013 and he is concerned about the vast array of presidential emergency powers that we do know about.  Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976 alone, the president can declare a national emergency just by signing a proclamation. Cole said, \"We've got a president who, in his first week in office, essentially declared an emergency to ban Muslims from coming into the country. More recently, [he] declared a widely understood to be a fake emergency in order to build a border wall when Congress told him they would not give him the funds to create a border wall. \u00a0 \"And most recently, [he] has declared that he may need to delay the election, which would be an emergency authority that doesn't even exist. So, I think you have to be very concerned.\" Which brings us back to those mysterious Presidential Emergency Action Documents: John Yoo is a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. While serving at the Justice Department after 9/11, Yoo drafted the memo that justified the use of \"enhanced interrogation\" of terrorism suspects. Yoo was asked by Koppel, \"Just to reassure our viewers a little bit, John, you've seen these PEADs?\" \"I am not allowed to say whether I have or not,\" he laughed.  \"Let me put it this way: You were at the Justice Department. Presumably the Justice Department would've had to deal with these PEADs if a president wanted to implement one?\" \"Yes, that's fair to say,\" Yoo replied. \"The Justice Department and the office I worked in would review the legality of the PEADs because they would draw on presidential powers and Congressional powers delegated to them.\" Just a couple of weeks ago, Yoo was at the White House discussing executive power with President Trump. \"'Cause you never know what the emergency is gonna be,\" said Yoo. \"So, these PEADs and similar contingency planning documents, when we look back historically at them, sometimes they seem comic.\" \"The notion that there are executive powers based on something that has never been vetted by Congress, giving the president almost limitless powers to do what he needs to do in the event of a crisis, that's not funny to me; that's scary,\" Koppel said.  \"Oh, forgive me. I don't mean this whole question is comic,\" Yoo said. \"And you are right, Ted. \u00a0There's dangers to that, and we've seen in our history where presidents have gone too far. I guess there's a balance, and I guess the founders, they balanced in favor of giving the president that kind of ability to face emergencies, even understanding that a badly-intentioned president might abuse those powers.\" Goitein said, \"These PEADs undergo periodic revision. And we know that the Department of Justice is in the middle of one of these periodic reviews and revisions. So, we have to imagine what the Trump administration might be doing with these documents and what authorities this administration might be trying to give itself.\" Yoo said, \"That's why the framers created the presidency, was because it could act quickly. I would want President Obama or President Biden to have the power to respond quickly to a hurricane or a terrorist attack, just as I would want President Trump to.\" \"That's fairly benign, John,\" said Koppel. \"But what if what the president was planning to do was the suspension of habeas corpus? How would you feel about it then?\" \"I'd be the first to admit that, in emergencies, the executive branch can make mistakes, and that's sometimes the price of swift action,\" Yoo replied. \"Congress is more likely to get things right. The founders thought that. But Congress is too large and too slow to act decisively.\" Having said that, Yoo would be comfortable giving a few select Members of Congress classified access to the secret PEADs.  Gary Hart doesn't think that goes far enough: \"I want them public, because they affect the freedom and liberty and rights of every American citizen,\" he said. \"I can't say it any better. This is a blueprint for dictatorship. Now, I think the more attention it gets, the less likely those in power are going to use them.\" Koppel said, \"We have so much publicity, Senator Hart, we have so many different voices being raised in anger, in outrage, in fury, I'm not sure what a few more voices raising an issue like this, what impact that's going to have.\" Hart replied, \"This goes to the core of our country and our founding. And if there is what amounts to the capability to suspend our Constitution, that's not just another issue. That's serious. Keep in mind, the current, incumbent president has declared seven national emergencies. And he has stated repeatedly that he has more power than most people know about.\" \"And you find that frightening?\" asked Koppel.  \"I will not reverse the question,\" Hart replied.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For more info: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Story produced by Deirdre Cohen.

            "article_content": "President Trump will hold his next campaign rally\u00a0in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on Saturday, July 11 \u2014 and this time, the rally will be outdoors. The trip also marks the president's first campaign rally in a political battleground state and second mega-event since his hiatus from the trail due to the coronavirus pandemic. The president's reelection campaign announced Sunday that the rally will take place at Portsmouth International Airport at 8 p.m. ET. According to a statement released by the Trump campaign, the outdoor event will feature \"ample access to hand sanitizer\" and all attendees \"will be provided a face mask that they are strongly encouraged to wear.\" Trump campaign officials tell\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0that all attendees will also be required to pass a temperature check upon entry. Though the event will technically take place on federal land at the former site of Pease Air Force Base, the Trump campaign has coordinated with Governor Chris Sununu's office and state officials ahead of Saturday's event. There have been over 5,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases in New Hampshire, and more than 380 deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire residents disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a University of New Hampshire survey released last month. In a survey of New Hampshire voters released last month, Mr. Trump trails Joe Biden. The presumptive Democratic nominee led the GOP incumbent 49% to 42% among registered voters, according to the Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll. Mr. Trump last visited the Granite State on February 10, which was the eve of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, for a crowded indoor rally in downtown Manchester. But it was in 2011 that then-real estate mogul Donald Trump first dropped into Portsmouth International Airport in a Trump-emblazoned black helicopter to explore a GOP primary bid, after pushing false rumors that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. The upcoming rally, just a few short miles from the Maine border, is expected to also draw supporters from the neighboring state. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Maine's 2nd congressional district, making him the first Republican to score Maine electoral votes since George H. W. Bush in 1988. The Republican mayor of the Democratic-leaning city of Portsmouth, Rick Becksted, said he learned of the rally Sunday evening while watching the news and receiving email inquiries. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JOE BIDEN Joe Biden continues to chart a rhetorical contrast on Mr. Trump's declared \"war\" on cancel culture and the debate over racial equality in the country,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports. The Biden campaign said it was clear after Friday's presidential address at Mount Rushmore that the \"divisive president \u2026 doesn't give a damn about anything but his own gain.\" In his Independence Day message, Biden cited notes of history on slavery and the Civil War as examples of work still needed to fulfill the country's founding promise \"that all men [and women] are created equal.\" The former vice president didn't appear anywhere publicly for the Fourth of July as his focus has been hyper cognizant on social distancing guidelines from both federal officials and officials in his home state of Delaware. Monday was another day without public appearances for Biden but his campaign announced their senior Florida ground game team, adding to the handful of battleground states where the Democrats have a physical staffing presence. \u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN Senator Elizabeth Warren is asking the country's largest food and beverage processors and farm operators to disclose what they're doing to protect their workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. In a letter to companies including Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz sent last week and released Monday, Warren along with Senators Jeff Merkley and Cory Booker wrote that failing to take substantial virus protection measures could have impacts beyond the health of their workers. \"Outbreaks in your facilities could threaten the broader food supply chain by further exacerbating existing labor shortages and reducing plant processing capacity,\" they wrote. \"Given the increasing consolidation of your industry, both producers and consumers could be left with limited alternatives, negatively affecting market opportunities for farmers and creating potential shortages for consumers.\" In June, Warren and Booker had raised similar concerns about worker safety at meatpacking plants. KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced Monday on Twitter that she has tested positive for COVID-19. Bottoms later said in an interview on MSNBC that the news came as a shock to her, as she had only experienced mild allergy-like symptoms. \"This is startling for me because we've been so very careful. But certainly we are not immune.\" Bottoms said in the interview and added, \"This is just a lesson to everyone. That you have to take every single symptom seriously as I see this growing list of symptoms. We can't assume that it's seasonal allergies. We can't assume that a mild cough, I get a seasonal allergies. We all need to be tested.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry reports that members of Bottoms' team have begun contact tracing measures. The mayor recently met with the family members of Secoriea Turner, a young girl who was murdered in Atlanta over the weekend. \u00a0Bottoms will quarantine in her home for the next two weeks. SUPREME DECISIONS The Supreme Court on Monday said states can require presidential electors to cast their votes for their party's candidate that won the state's popular vote, upholding state laws that punish so-called \"faithless electors\" who break their pledge and vote for a candidate other than the one who won the state's popular vote.\u00a0CBS News digital reporter Melissa Quinn\u00a0says\u00a0the high court was unanimous in its\u00a0ruling that the laws at issue in a pair of disputes from Washington and Colorado are constitutional. The decision from the Supreme Court comes just months ahead of the November general election, when voters will head to the polls to elect a president and vice president. \"The Constitution's text and the nation's history both support allowing a state to enforce an elector's pledge to support his party's nominee \u2014 and the state voters' choice \u2014 for president,\" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor took no part in the decision of the dispute involving faithless electors in Colorado. The justices\u00a0heard arguments\u00a0in the disputes, the last of its term, via teleconference, as the court was forced to alter the format of arguments because of the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0pandemic. NEVADA The Nevada State Democratic Party marked the launch of their coordinated campaign with \"virtual ice cream socials\"\u00a0across the state\u00a0over the weekend, with \"more than two dozen new field organizers\"\u00a0hired in the past month\u00a0as they race to ramp up their operation ahead of the general election, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Biden's team in Nevada has also brought on\u00a0another new top aide, Elizabeth Warren campaign alum Kevin Liao, to serve as their Nevada communications director. \"We've built up a strong field program across 2016 and 2018 and, this year, we're taking nothing for granted,\" Shelby Wiltz, head of the state party's coordinated campaign,\u00a0said in a statement.\u00a0 UTAH In Utah's Republican gubernatorial primary, Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox has beaten former Governor and U.S. ambassador to China Jon Huntsman. The race was June 30,\u00a0but due to the close initial margin and counting of mail ballots, the Associated Press called the race Monday afternoon. Cox captured 36.4% of the vote, while Huntsman had 34.6%. Cox is the favorite against Democrat law Professor Chris Harrison in November, since there hasn't been a Democratic governor since 1985.\u00a0 \u00a0 IN THE HOUSE NEW JERSEY Originally slated for June 2 but postponed due to coronavirus, 12 House districts and one Senate seat will be on the ballot Tuesday in New Jersey. Some of the races to watch include a Kennedy, a progressive challenger to a Democrat incumbent, and a heated Republican primary for a targeted seat.\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0has more below on some of the races to watch. New Jersey's 2nd Amy Kennedy and political science professor Brigid Callahan Harrison are leading the Democratic primary to challenge Congressman Jeff Van Drew, who notably switched parties during the impeachment process. Kennedy, an educator and wife of former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy, has the endorsements of Governor Phil Murphy and the Atlantic County Democratic Party, where one-third of voters reside. Harrison originally filed to primary Van Drew the week he voted against impeachment, and has been backed by six county chairs as well as Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker. \u00a0Another candidate in the running is Will Cunningham, a former congressional staffer who ran against Van Drew in the 2018 primary.\u00a0 New Jersey's 3rd Democrat freshman Andy Kim is among the top targets for national Republicans, as Mr. Trump won this district by 6 points in 2016 before Kim narrowly flipped it in the midterms. In his district is a competitive GOP primary between engineer & lawyer David Richter and Kate Gibbs, a former elected official in Burlington County. Richter has loaned his campaign more money, but Gibbs has gotten support from outside groups such as the Defending Main Street PAC.\u00a0 New Jersey's 5th Congressman Josh Gottheimer is facing a challenge from the left with local Councilwoman Arati Kreibich. Kreibich has recently been backed by progressive stalwarts like Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders. Gottheimer, who is in his second term, has the backing of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Representatives Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey. \u00a0Gottheimer is currently co-chair of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, and Kreibich's campaign has looked to tie Gottheimer's focus on bipartisanship to the Republican party and Wall Street. Internal Gottheimer polls have him with a safe lead (62% to 21%), while Kreibich's internal polling shows her within a two-point margin after respondents were given more information about her platform and messaging. Both campaigns are prepared for results to come in later than Tuesday night due to the influx of mail-in ballots. CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Nicole Sganga\u00a0join CBSN to talk about their reporting in\u00a0California\u00a0and\u00a0Maine\u00a0for CBS News COVID Chronicles.

            "article_content": "Kabul, Afghanistan \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Kabul Monday on an urgent visit to try to move forward a U.S. peace deal signed last month with the Taliban, a trip that comes at a time when world leaders and statesmen are curtailing official travel due to the coronavirus pandemic. Since the signing of the deal, the peace process has stalled amid political turmoil in Afghanistan, with the country's leaders squabbling over who was elected president. President Ashraf Ghani and his main rival in last September's presidential polls, Abdullah Abdullah, both declared themselves the country's president in dueling inauguration ceremonies earlier this month.  Pompeo was to meet separately with Ghani and Abdullah before meeting together with both. His schedule also had Ghani and Abdullah coming together for a one-on-one meeting, presumably to discuss a possible compromise. The United States pays billions every year toward the Afghan budget, including the country's defense forces. Afghanistan barely raises a quarter of the revenue it needs to run the country, giving Pompeo considerable financial leverage to force the two squabbling leaders to overcome the impasse. The political turmoil has put on hold the start of intra-Afghan peace talks that would include the Taliban. Those talks are seen as a critical next step in the peace deal, negotiated to enable the United States to bring home its troops and give Afghans the best chance at peace. The U.S. and NATO have already begun to withdraw some troops from Afghanistan. The final pullout of U.S. forces isn't dependent on the success of intra-Afghan negotiations but rather on promises made by the Taliban to deny space in Afghanistan to other terror groups, such as the insurgents' rival Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). But within days of the U.S.- and the Taliban signing the peace deal in Qatar on Feb. 29, Afghanistan plunged into a political crisis with Ghani and Abdullah squaring off over election results and Ghani refusing to fulfill his part of a promise made in the U.S.-Taliban deal to free up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners. The insurgents were, for their part, to free 1,000 Afghan officials and soldiers they hold captive. The exchange was meant to be a good-will gesture by both sides to start the negotiations. The urgency of Pompeo's surprise visit was highlighted by the fact that the State Department has warned American citizens against all international travel, citing the spread of the new coronavirus. Pompeo has cancelled at least two domestic U.S. trips because of the outbreak, including one to a now-cancelled G7 foreign ministers meeting that was to have taken place in Pittsburgh this week. That meeting will now take place by video conference. Pompeo's last overseas trip in late February was to Doha, Qatar, for the signing of the U.S.-Taliban peace deal he is now trying to salvage. As the virus pandemic has worsened, causing many nations to close their borders and airports and cancel international flights, Pompeo and the State Department have come under increasing criticism for not doing enough to help Americans stranded overseas to get home. On Saturday, just hours before he departed on his unannounced trip to Afghanistan, Pompeo was roundly attacked on social media for a photo he posted to his personal Twitter account of him and his wife, Susan, at home working on a jigsaw puzzle with a scene from the Tom Cruise film \"Top Gun\" on a TV screen. \"Susan and I are staying in and doing a puzzle this afternoon. Pro tip: if you're missing the beach, just throw on Top Gun!\" the caption read. Many of the critics took Pompeo to task for apparently not working while thousands of Americans are struggling to find transportation home from various countries. Washington's peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been trying to jumpstart talks between Afghans on both sides of the conflict - the next critical step in the U.S.-Taliban deal - tweeted early Monday that the two sides are talking about the prisoner exchange.  The intra-Afghan negotiations were never going to be easy but since Washington signed the peace deal with the Taliban, it has struggled to get the Afghan government to at least offer a unified position. Pompeo's visit is also extraordinary for the fact that the U.S., like the United Nations, had earlier said it wouldn't again be drawn into mediating between feuding Afghan politicians. While the Afghan election committee this time gave the win to Ghani, Abdullah and the election complaints commission charged widespread irregularities in challenging Ghani's win. In Afghanistan's previous presidential election in 2014, also marred by widespread fraud and deeply disputed results, Ghani and Abdullah emerged as leading contenders. Then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry mediated between the two and eventually cobbled together a so-called unity government, with Ghani as president and Abdullah holding the newly created but equal-in-stature post of the country's chief executive. However, the Ghani-Andullah partnership proved difficult and for much of its five years triggered a parliamentary paralysis, leading up to the September balloting.",

            "article_content": "Ahmedabad, India\u00a0\u2014 India poured on the pageantry with a joyful, colorful welcome for President Trump on Monday that kicked off a whirlwind 36-hour visit meant to reaffirm U.S.-India ties while providing enviable overseas imagery for a president in a re-election year. But the trip comes at time of rising trade tensions between the two nations. More than 100,000 people packed into the world's largest cricket stadium, giving Mr. Trump the biggest rally crowd of his political career, for the pinnacle of the day's trio of presidential photo-ops. He and first lady Melania Trump first visited a former home of independence leader Mohandas Gandhi. They also toured the famed Taj Mahal. Nearly everyone in the newly constructed stadium in Ahmedabad in western India sported a white cap with the name of the event, \"Namaste, Trump\" \u2014 meaning, in essence, a reverential welcome to the president \u2014 and roared for the introductions of both Mr. Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The boisterous scene featured soldiers on camels, a mix of songs from Bollywood hits and the Trump campaign rally playlist, including an Elton John hit that seemed to puzzle most of the crowd.\u00a0 Mr. Trump basked in the raucous reception that has eluded him on many foreign trips, some of which have featured massive protests and icy handshakes from world leaders. In India, he instead received a warm embrace at the airport - literally - from the ideologically aligned and hugger Modi. The sun-baked city of Ahmedabad bustled as Mr. Trump arrived, as the streets teemed with people eager to catch a glimpse of the American president. Newly cleaned roads and planted flowers dotted the roads amid hundreds of billboards featuring the president and first lady. Thousands lined his motorcade route, shy of the up to 10 million that Mr. Trump speculated would be on hand.  On the way to the stadium, Mr. Trump's motorcade crossed over a river where a barge was emblazoned with \"TRUMP\" and onlookers chanted \"Modi!\" The stadium was packed with revelers, many of whom sported Trump and Modi masks, as they sat in 80-degree temperatures. The \"Namaste Trump\" rally was, in a way, the back half of home-and-home events for Modi and Mr. Trump, who attended a \"Howdy Modi\" rally in Houston last year that drew 50,000 people.  Mr. Trump lavished praise on both Modi and the democracy he leads, touting an effort to lift residents out of extreme poverty, saying \"India gives hope to all of humanity.\"  \"Your nation is doing so well, we are very very proud of India,\" he said. \"The story of the Indian nation is a tale of astounding progress.\"\u00a0 He seemed to get the most cheers and applause when he addressed joint U.S.-Indian efforts to fight terrorism. Mr. Trump said he and Modi would sign deals worth over $3 billion Tuesday to sell U.S. helicopters to the Indian military. Mr. Trump's foreign visits have typically been light on sightseeing, but this time, the president and first lady visited the Taj Mahal. Stories in local media warned of monkeys that inhabit the landmark pestering tourists for food and, on occasion, menacing both visitors and slingshot-carrying security guards. Images of American presidents being feted on the world stage stand in contrast to those of their rivals in the opposing party slogging through diners in early-voting states and clashing in debate. This trip, in particular, reflects a Trump campaign strategy to showcase him in his presidential role during short, carefully managed trips that provide counter-programming to the Democrats' primary contest and produce the kinds of visuals his campaign can use in future ads. His aides also believe the visit could help the president woo tens of thousands of Indian-American voters before the November election.  The visit also comes at a crucial moment for Modi, a fellow populist, who has provided over a steep economic downturn and unfulfilled campaign promises about job creation.\u00a0 India is also seen as an important counter to China, with which it shares a border.\u00a0 The president will conclude his whirlwind visit to India Tuesday with a day in the capital, complete with a gala dinner meetings with Modi over stalled trade talks between the two nations. The two countries are closely allied, in part to act as a bulwark against the rising influence of nearby China, but trade tensions between the two countries have escalated since the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium from India. India responded with higher penalties on agricultural goods and restrictions on U.S. medical devices. The U.S. retaliated by removing India from a decades-old preferential trade program.  Perhaps alluding to tough negotiations over trade, Mr. Trump lightheartedly told the rally crowd: \"Everybody loves him, but I will tell you this. He's very tough.\"\u00a0 Eyes will also be on whether Mr. Trump weighs on in the protests enveloping India over its Citizenship Amendment Act. It provides a fast track to naturalization for some migrants who entered the country illegally while fleeing religious persecution, but excludes Muslims, raising fears that the country is moving toward a religious citizenship test. Passage has prompted large-scale protests and a violent crackdown. Typically, Mr. Trump hasn't publicly rebuked world leaders for human rights abuses during his overseas trips. But one senior administration official said the U.S. is concerned about the situation and that the president will tell Modi the world is looking to India to continue to uphold its democratic traditions and respect religious minorities. Indian police used tear gas and smoke grenades to disperse a crowd of thousands of demonstrators in New Delhi Monday as violence broke out over the citizenship law, the Reuters news service reports. Hundreds of supporters of the law clashed with protesters, with both sides throwing stones at the other. Another example of anti-Trump sentiment: \u00a0",

            "article_content": "In just over a week, Nevada will be the third state to hold a primary contest on Saturday, February 22, but voters in the Silver State will have the opportunity to choose their candidates during a round of early voting starting tomorrow, February 15 through February 18.\u00a0 Like Iowa, Nevada voters choose their preferred primary candidate through\u00a0caucuses. However, there are some key differences between the two contests, and Nevada will be looking to prove it can competently carry out a caucus process after the Iowa Democratic Party's mayhem this year, report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin,\u00a0CBS News Political Unit AP Ellee Watson, and\u00a0CBSNews.com politics reporter Grace Segers. Candidates' performance in the state's four congressional districts will determine the 23 district-level delegates, and their statewide results will determine how many of the 11 at-large and \"pledged elected official\" delegates they receive. In total, Nevada sends 48 delegates and 3 alternates to the Democratic National Convention in the summer. If you're going to be caucusing in Nevada or just interested in the process,\u00a0here's how it works. NEVADA The Nevada Democratic Veterans and Military Families Caucus thanked four candidates currently in the race \u2014 Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Bernie Sanders, and Tom Steyer \u2014 \u00a0in a post Friday\u00a0for having \"visited us and freely spoke with our Veterans and Military Families at roundtables and town halls,\" \u00a0reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, the group said, invited selected members \"to a small round-robin event where she lectured us on her military housing policy.\"\u00a0 The group says two other candidates in the race \u2014 Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden \u2014 shunned their invitations to meet directly, having \"either never responded, responded by sending surrogates, or committed to meeting and then canceling.\" One of those surrogate events\u00a0happened just last week, when Khizr Khan met with the group in Las Vegas on behalf of Biden.\u00a0 ON THE DEBATE STAGE The Democratic National Committee announced Friday the 11th Democratic presidential primary debate will take place in Phoenix, Arizona in partnership with the CHC BOLD, which is the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\u00a0 The debate is scheduled for Sunday, March 15, two days before the state's March 17th Democratic primary, reports\u00a0CBS News Political Unit AP Sarah Ewall-Wice. It'll be hosted by CNN and Univision. Debate moderators and qualifications will be announced at a later date. Two other debates are still in the works, too. The DNC has a debate scheduled for February 19 in Las Vegas ahead of the Nevada caucuses on February 22. CBS News will also be hosting a debate in Charleston, South Carolina, on February 25, ahead of the state's primary on February 29. Democrats seek to turn Arizona from a historically red state to blue. In 2018, Arizona elected Kyrsten Sinema to the Senate, making her the first Democratic senator to represent the state since the 1970s. \u00a0 IN THE HOUSE While the political world waits to see the impacts Super Tuesday could have on the presidential race down the ballot competitive House primaries are ramping up the attacks in their ads, says\u00a0CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0 The Democratic primary in Texas' 28th District between progressive Jessica Cisneros and incumbent Congressman Henry Cuellar, a more conservative leaning, \"Blue Dog\" Democrat, mirrors the debate about how wide the political spectrum can be for today's Democratic party.\u00a0 Cisneros has received the support of progressive juggernauts like Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and one of her latest ads portrays Cuellar as Mr. Trump's \"favorite Democrat\" due to his previous votes on the border wall.\u00a0 Cuellar says Cisneros is fueled by out-of-state money and that she wants to shut down the oil and gas industry. Even the groups backing the candidates continue to show the ideological divides among the two candidates and their potential voter groups. In addition to Sanders, former presidential candidate Julian Castro and multiple Texas labor unions announced their endorsements of Cisneros on Thursday, while Cuellar received the backing of the LIBRE Initiative Action nonprofit, an outreach group that's part of the Koch's conservative political network. In California, the Republican primary in the state's 50th District has turned into a battle of who can \"out Trump\" the other. Darrell Issa, a former congressman that represented the neighboring 49th District, is facing Carl DeMaio, a conservative talk show host and former San Diego City Councilman. DeMaio has been consistently attacking Issa for his past comments of calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Russia's involvement in the 2016 elections,\u00a0and in a new ad, ties Issa to Senator Mitt Romney's \"Yes\" vote on impeachment.\u00a0 In a release, DeMaio's campaign portrays Romney as \"radioactive\" and that \"anyone associated with Romney's betrayal of Trump will pay a price.\" Meanwhile Issa\u00a0released an ad\u00a0saying DeMaio is pro-abortion, using past clips of him talking about the freedom of choice on abortion. \"Pro-life organizations and leaders know there's only one True Trump Conservative in this race who will help President Trump further pro-life legislation and values: Darrell Issa,\" said Issa for Congress Communications Director Greg Blair in a statement.\u00a0 They are running to replace former Representative Duncan Hunter,\u00a0who resigned in January.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "When Donald Trump won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, he\u00a0reportedly credited\u00a0the opioid epidemic, calling the state a \"drug infested den.\" He effectively tied widespread opioid addiction to his signature campaign theme \u2014 the border wall he wanted to build across the U.S. southern border with Mexico \u2014 saying that the drugs were coming up through Mexico. Presidential candidates or opioid deaths were the main recurring topics in New Hampshire news that year, when 20 people were listed on the major-party primary ballots, and 437 people died of opioid overdoses. Despite the attention, the number rose in 2017. And now, it still ranks among the top five states for opioid- and drug-related deaths, says CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0 Now, in 2020, White House hopefuls are accustomed to including, along with traditional retail stops, visits to rehab centers, where they unveil expensive plans to curb opioid abuse.\u00a0 Last year\u00a0a study on mortality rates in the U.S.\u00a0found New Hampshire had the largest increase in the rate of deaths of people between 25 and 64. The report, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed the rate of deaths among young and middle aged people in New Hampshire increased by 23% between 2010 and 2017. Despite its pervasiveness, the opioid epidemic and its many victims have garnered little attention on the Democratic debate stage. That could change Friday night, as the candidates take the debate stage in Manchester. Seven of the remaining 11 Democratic contenders still in the presidential race will debate at St. Anselm University. Friday morning, ABC News announced left-to-right podium order as follows: entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer. The debate begins at 8 p.m. EST. In this special\u00a0DEBATE\u00a0edition of\u00a0Trail Markers, the\u00a0CBS News Political Unit\u00a0gives a rundown of what to watch from each presidential candidate as well as other political news of the day. JOE BIDEN VIA CBS NEW CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON:\u00a0Five days after the Iowa caucuses, both advisers and top allies of Joe Biden are hoping the campaign can regain its breath after their 4th-place finish, which the candidate called a \"gut punch.\" While many attendees at Biden's New Hampshire events this week say they are not considering Iowa's results in their voting decision, several of them on Tuesday told CBS News they were underwhelmed by Biden's first day back in the Granite State. \"I expected a little bit more energy,\" Shaun McGahey, 35, from Pembroke, said standing on the rope line with her two kids in Concord. \"It wasn't every 30 seconds you are getting interrupting to cheer for what he said.\" Biden and his advisers retooled his message on Wednesday and threw a few punches of his own by\u00a0questioning the records of rivals Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg.\u00a0These weren't new criticisms but, with the assistance of a teleprompter, it was the first time Biden's critiques of his rivals were the main thrust of his pitch. Sanders, according to Biden, is too far left and will sink fellow Democratic candidates nationwide with his \"democratic socialist\" label. Buttigieg is too green, Biden argued, stating his mayoral experience does not fit the challenges awaiting a post-MAGA administration. On Thursday, Biden spent the day preparing for the debate in Delaware, according to a source. When disagreements broke out on previous debate stages, Biden sometimes physically stepped back from his podium \u2014 a sign that he was steering clear of dueling rivals. But does Biden now feel like he needs to be in every fight? And what about Elizabeth Warren, who like Buttigieg has previously criticized Biden's long record in Washington. As he did with Buttigieg, will Biden demand to know if Warren thinks the Obama administration was a \"failure\"? PETE BUTTIGIEG VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN:\u00a0Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg had a strong performance in the Iowa caucuses. While the Iowa Democratic Party has had major issues with reporting the results, Buttigieg has been campaigning in New Hampshire and said on Tuesday, before the final returns were in, that his campaign had an \"astonishing victory\" in Iowa. While CBS News has not declared a winner of the Iowa caucuses, it appears that Buttigieg, who has campaigned as an alternative to some of his more moderate competitors, will finish ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. On Friday, Bernie Sanders criticized Buttigieg for taking money from billionaires. Buttigieg has held the kind of high-dollar fundraisers that Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have both sworn off. Will Sanders continue to push Buttigieg on receiving money from billionaires? With Buttigieg coming out of Iowa ahead of Biden and Klobuchar, will the more moderate candidates criticize the . millennial former mayor's lack of Washington experience? And with Sanders and Buttigieg both coming out of Iowa declaring victory, how will Buttigieg use the debate to continue momentum and convince undecided voters? AMY KLOBUCHAR VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON:\u00a0Whether it was complimenting Stacey Abrams while debating in Georgia or her staying on a jobs-focused message in Ohio, Amy Klobuchar has repeatedly connected what she says in the debates to the place in which the debate is being held. That could help her during Friday's debate in New Hampshire, which comes just days before the state's primary.\u00a0 Several Klobuchar allies told CBS News they still see the senator in introduction mode with many Democratic voters. Her campaign says she \"surged\" in Iowa, although she landed in fifth place only a few points behind Joe Biden. For almost the whole campaign Klobuchar has delicately run against Biden, usually only mentioning the former vice president when asked. But before the official results even began to trickle out, Klobuchar's campaign manager\u00a0tweeted\u00a0that she beat Biden in Iowa.\u00a0 With a little more heat, could she pick off the former vice president in New Hampshire? She's made the generational argument and criticized Biden's 2002 vote for the Iraq War. Or will she get more bang from bashing Buttigieg? In previous debates, Klobuchar has repeatedly discussed the mayor's limited resum\u00e9.\u00a0 Barring a dismal finish in New Hampshire on Tuesday, the Minnesota senator's campaign is set to march into the new early states where they have dispatched additional staff. Senior advisers say the campaign's frugalness puts them in position to compete comfortably through South Carolina. \u00a0 BERNIE SANDERS VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER CARA KORTE:\u00a0Two candidates are claiming they won the Iowa caucuses, and neither will be standing center stage tonight.\u00a0 What does that mean? Perhaps it means that there's going to be a lot of crossfire Friday evening. Who's on top? Who's trying to scratch back? What we know about Bernie Sanders is that his campaign is in an upswing. While other candidates are cutting staff and pulling advertising in early states, Sanders just doubled down with a $5.5 million ad buy in Super Tuesday states. His campaign also just had its strongest fundraising month to date with $25 million raised in January.\u00a0 Sanders says he won in Iowa so that naturally puts him at odds with Pete Buttigieg, who gave a victory speech the night of the caucuses. Campaigning Friday morning in New Hampshire, Sanders took a swing at the former mayor. \"I like Pete Buttigieg, nice guy. But we are in a moment where billionaires control not only our economy but our political life,\" said Sanders. Sanders criticism of Buttgieg came alongside some harsh words for another former mayor, Mike Bloomberg. Sanders also called Bloomberg a \"nice guy\" but told the crowd that the New Yorker is \"spending millions to buy the election.\" He added, \"There's something wrong with that\u2026But we are in a moment where billionaires control not only the economic but political life of this country.\"\u00a0 At the same event Friday, Sanders evoked the Woody Guthrie song \"Which Side Are You?\" \u2013 an old union tune. (We heard Sanders make the same reference when he was in Guthrie's home state of Oklahoma last September at a rally with 4,000 supporters.) Sanders then posed the question to the crowd in New Hampshire: Which side are you on? The side of the working class who have been ignored by politicians for decades? Or, in Sanders' telling, the side of the billionaires running corrupt industries and controlling this country?\u00a0 Sanders is portraying himself as the standard-bearer of one side while trying to make Pete Buttigieg the representative of the other. Will voters agree with that assessment of the race? TOM STEYER VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK:\u00a0While most candidates headed to New Hampshire early in the morning after the Iowa caucus, Tom Steyer prepared to go to Nevada. Steyer's campaign has made no secret of the fact they see Nevada and South Carolina as the early states where he could thrive. But the billionaire candidate made it known Thursday he was ready to brawl with an ad running in New Hampshire that took aim at Buttigieg, Biden and \"socialists.\" For Steyer, a major surprise in New Hampshire is unlikely. But with Nevada around the corner, he could use anything even resembling an upset, and his ad strongly signals he is looking to make a case for himself over one of the major contenders on stage. If so, the only question is who\u2014between Biden, Buttigieg or Sanders\u2014Steyer will go after tonight. ELIZABETH WARREN VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK:\u00a0Elizabeth Warren needs to turn things around after Iowa, and the New Hampshire debate will be a major opportunity for her to do so. The Massachusetts senator has four days to shore up support in her neighboring state, where a CBS News poll a month ago and another poll Thursday put her in third place. Warren's third-place finish in Iowa was a hit to a campaign that had invested heavily in the state from the start. It's left her at the margins of the conversation as Buttigieg, Biden and Sanders have taken swings at one another over the past few days. Warren's campaign has touted its more than 1,000 staffers across the country as an example how they plan. But without momentum out of New Hampshire, Warren, who has sworn off large-dollar fundraisers, could have trouble raising money from the grassroots donors who have propelled her campaign so far.\u00a0 Warren has generally avoided conflict with other candidates, at least publicly, but that may change tonight. There are several contrasts she has subtly made with her fellow progressive Sanders, who leads in the state. For example, has put a price tag and a payment plan on her \"Medicare for All\" proposal, while he has not. The stakes haven't been higher, so will Warren concentrate her fire Sanders? ANDREW YANG VIA CBS NEWS POLITICAL UNIT ASSOCIATE PRODUCER BEN MITCHELL:\u00a0Andrew Yang has long made New Hampshire the focal point of his candidacy and good reason: The state's high percentage of independents and its libertarian streak are a good match for his policies and his outsider campaign.\u00a0 Friday's debate, however, is likely his last chance to break out. Support for Yang remains mired in the low single-digits in the latest New Hampshire polls while his campaign appears to be struggling everywhere else. Yang invested heavily in Iowa, spending 20 days in January crossing the state and holding 76 events in the run up to the caucus. Despite all his time and a nearly $7 million investment in TV ads, Yang placed a distant sixth and netted just 1% of SDEs. Now, after spending millions more than he raised in Q4, Yang is laying off \"dozens\" of staffers across the early states. Without a strong showing tonight to boost his fundraising and an even stronger showing in Tuesday's primary, Yang's days could be numbered. APP-REHENSIVE A spokeswoman for the Nevada State Democratic Party said Friday that no mobile apps will be involved in their upcoming caucuses, following the party's decision to scrap their reliance on a software developer at the heart of the\u00a0days-long delay\u00a0in Iowa's results. The party says they are still \"testing our process\" before early voting is scheduled to kick off in the state next week. Internally, multiple Democrats in Nevada tell\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0the party has floated the use of an unspecified \"tool\" to assist in reporting results on the day of the caucus, to be showcased at volunteer summits in the state this weekend. Aides to multiple campaigns say they have heard few details about the \"tool,\" though the party insists they have remained in \"constant contact\" with campaigns in the state. \"It's disappointing that campaigns aren't being given a seat at the table to help ensure what happens in Iowa doesn't repeat,\" said one Democratic campaign on Friday. In a statement to CBS News, spokesperson Molly Forgey said that the state party has \"maintained a high level of communication\" with the campaigns. \"Our main objective is running the most expansive, transparent, and accessible caucus that ensures Nevadans voices are heard,\" Forgey said. \"We've maintained a high level of communication with campaigns at every step of the way and that will never change.\"\u00a0 ON THE $$$ Two of the Democrats' largest super PACS, Priorities USA Action and Senate Majority PAC, are teaming up to run a new multimillion dollar digital ad campaign focused on battleground Senate races in Arizona, Maine and North Carolina, following Republicans' votes to acquit President Trump, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. Senators Martha McSally, Susan Collins and Thom Tillis all found the president not guilty on articles of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. All three also happen to be facing tough re-elections in their home states.\u00a0 McSally and Collins were both outraised by Democratic opponents in the fourth quarter of 2019. Tillis is also facing a serious challenge. \"Just winning the White House wouldn't be enough. If we want to enact real change in this country, we need a Democratic Senate,\" said Priorities USA Action's Executive Director Patrick McHugh of the partnership. \u00a0 \"By exonerating President Trump without securing a fair trial, Senate Republicans have ignored the rule of law and the will of the American people. Our new digital partnership with Priorities will allow us to hold Senate Republicans accountable by aggressively targeting voters in battleground states that are key to flipping the Senate,\" added Senate Majority PAC President J.B. Poersch in a statement. Priorities USA Action and Senate Majority PAC's partnership to further help their opponents comes after the two PACs also ran a $30 million digital campaign across eight senate races in 2018. JOE WALSH One of the Republican challengers to Mr. Trump suspended his long-shot bid on Friday ahead of New Hampshire's primary, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Former congressman and radio personality Joe Walsh announced on Twitter the suspension of his campaign. He began his bid in August but failed to gain traction in terms of polling and fundraising. He also has not qualified to be on the ballot in many states for the primaries. In his suspension announcement, he said he would stay committed to defeating Mr. Trump in November. Former governor Bill Weld is now the only national challenger remaining in the GOP primary.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday became the first top American diplomat to visit an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank. His visit comes as the State Department, in a major policy shift, announced that products from the settlements can be labeled \"Made in Israel.\" The two moves reflected the Trump administration's acceptance of Israeli settlements, which the Palestinians and most of the international community view as a violation of international law and a major obstacle to peace. Pompeo also announced that the U.S. would brand the international Palestinian-led boycott movement against Israel as \"anti-Semitic\" and bar any groups that participate in it from receiving government funding. It was not immediately clear which groups would be affected by the move. \"We will regard the global, anti-Israel\u00a0BDS campaign\u00a0as anti-Semitic,\" Pompeo said, referring to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. \"We will immediately take steps to identify organizations that engage in hateful BDS conduct and withdraw U.S. government support for such groups,\" he said, adding that all nations should \"recognize the BDS movement for the cancer that it is.\" BDS organizers cast their movement as a non-violent way of protesting Israel's policies toward the Palestinians modeled on the campaign that helped end apartheid in South Africa. The movement has had some limited success over the years, particularly on college campuses and with artists and entertainers, but no impact on the Israeli economy. Israel views BDS as an assault on its very existence, and has\u00a0seized on statements by some supporters\u00a0to accuse it of anti-Semitism, allegations denied by organizers. In a statement, the BDS movement reiterated its rejection of \"all forms of racism, including anti-Jewish racism,\" and accused the U.S. and Israel of trying to silence advocacy for Palestinian rights. \"The BDS movement for Palestinian freedom, justice and equality, stands with all those struggling for a more dignified, just and beautiful world,\" it said. \"With our many partners, we shall resist these McCarthyite attempts to intimidate and bully Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights defenders into accepting Israeli apartheid and settler-colonialism as fate.\" Bob Goodfellow, Amnesty International USA's interim executive director, called the U.S. decision \"a gift to those who seek to silence, harass, intimidate and oppress those standing up for human rights around the world.\" Pompeo's announcements were largely symbolic and could be reversed by the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has promised a more evenhanded approach to Israel and the Palestinians. Nonetheless, they illustrated the deep ties between the outgoing Trump administration and the hard-line government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a Twitter post, Pompeo confirmed his visit to the Psagot winery, located in a settlement near Jerusalem, which released a blended red named for the secretary last year in gratitude for his stance on the settlements. Reporters were not allowed to accompany him. \"Enjoyed lunch at the scenic Psagot Winery today,\" he tweeted. \"Unfortunately, Psagot and other businesses have been targeted by pernicious EU labeling efforts that facilitate the boycott of Israeli companies. The U.S. stands with Israel and will not tolerate any form of delegitimization.\" The European Union, like most of the world, opposes Israeli settlements and requires imports from the occupied territory to be labeled as coming from the West Bank. Pompeo later visited the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed. In a break from the rest of the international community, the Trump administration recognized the territory as part of Israel last year. Pompeo was joined by Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi and Avigdor Kahalani, a decorated retired Israeli general famous for leading Israeli forces against a Syrian tank invasion during the 1973 Mideast war. \"You can't stand here and stare out at what's across the border and deny the central thing that President Trump recognized, what the previous presidents have refused to do,\" Pompeo said. \"This is a part of Israel and a central part of Israel.\" Israel passed a 2017 law that bars entry to foreigners who have called for economic boycotts of Israel or its settlements. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution opposing the boycott movement last year, and several U.S. states have enacted anti-BDS laws. Kate Ruane, senior legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that threatening to block funds to groups that criticize Israel is \"blatantly unconstitutional.\" Virtually all Palestinian civil society groups support the boycott movement. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. has already cut off nearly all forms of aid to the Palestinians. Biden has pledged to restore the aid as part of efforts to revive the peace process. Pompeo spoke at a press conference with Netanyahu, who said the Israel-U.S. alliance had reached \"unprecedented heights\" under the Trump administration. Netanyahu thanked the administration for moving its embassy to contested Jerusalem, abandoning the U.S. position that Israeli settlements are contrary to international law, recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights and taking a hard line against Iran. Israel captured east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 war. The Palestinians claim both territories and say the sprawling network of settlements have all but extinguished their hopes for a viable, independent state. Nabil Abu Rdeneh, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, condemned Pompeo's embrace of the settlements and accused the outgoing U.S. administration of \"active participation in the occupation of Palestinian lands.\" Turkey, where Pompeo angered officials on Tuesday by meeting with the leader of the world's Orthodox Christians while snubbing the country's leaders, said the visit to the settlement was a \"grave step\" that violates U.N. resolutions and \"legitimizes Israel's illegal actions.\" Trump's Mideast plan, which overwhelmingly favors Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians, would allow Israel to annex up to a third of the West Bank, including all of its settlements, which are home to nearly 500,000 Israelis. Neither Netanyahu nor Pompeo said anything about the U.S. election. Pompeo, like Trump, has yet to acknowledge Biden's victory. Netanyahu earlier this week congratulated Biden and referred to him as the president-elect in an official statement.",

He joined \"Fox and Friends\" Wednesday morning to discuss the results.\u00a0 \"I believe it's time for a new Republican Party to rise,\" Cawthorn said. \"I don't think we just need to have a bigger tent, I genuinely believe we need a bolder tent. I think the Republicans for too long have acted in timidity in issues where we should be leading.\"\u00a0 Cawthorne, a real estate investment CEO and motivational speaker, told Fox News that his priorities in Washington will be pushing for a more market-driven health care system and healing the partisan divide \u2014 although he is no stranger to partisan rhetoric himself. Cawthorn ran on a platform embracing religious freedom and border security and opposing abortion and what he deems socialized medicine.\u00a0 He named another millennial lawmaker \u2014 his ideological nemesis, New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 as a\u00a0motivation for running, decrying her as a leader of the \"radical left-wing mob.\" He replaces her in the history books as the youngest member elected to Congress in modern history. (Despite not meeting the constitutional age requirement of 25 for the U.S. House of Representatives, the youngest member ever elected was 22-year-old\u00a0William Cole Claiborne of Tennessee in 1797.) Cawthorne was partially paralyzed in an automobile accident in 2014 and credits the life-changing event with strengthening his faith and perseverance. One of Cawthorn's signature moments during his campaign happened at the Republican National Convention when he stood up from his wheelchair for the end of his speech. He is also a controversial figure. Before winning the vote, Cawthorn\u00a0tweeted Tuesday, \"Cry more, lib,\" as a shot to liberals. He was accused of being\u00a0\"racist\" by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker after Cawthorn's website accused Booker of trying to \"ruin white males running for office.\" He\u00a0said in a statement it was a \"syntax error\" that was meant to criticize \"left-wing identity politics.\"\u00a0 Cawthorn was also criticized for visiting Adolf Hitler's vacation home in Austria in 2017, saying it had been \"on my bucket list for awhile.\" He called it a \"fake news controversy.\" Cawthorn\u00a0won his party's nomination after beating an opponent who was endorsed by President Donald Trump. He will fill the seat formerly held by Mark Meadows, who is now serving as Mr. Trump's White House chief of staff.\u00a0 Christopher Brito is a social media manager and trending content writer for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Minsk\u00a0\u2014 For two months, young and old in Belarus have denounced President Alexander Lukashenko for allegedly stealing an election. His reaction has been savage. Several protesters have died of injuries sustained in a crackdown by security forces, and thousands of others have been detained or simply abducted.\u00a0 \u00a0 But the harsh response has clearly backfired. Despite being beaten, bludgeoned and even tortured, Belarusians' fear has fomented into anger, and courage.\u00a0 At times, they have protested peacefully in the streets by the hundreds of thousands. At other times, they've used the power of song.\u00a0 In subways and shopping malls, flash mobs have popped up to musically reject the government's authoritarian grip on power. The well-orchestrated demonstrations materialize, sing, and then dissipate back into the general population before police can catch them.\u00a0 \"We're like guerrilla fighters,\" some of the flash mob organizers told CBS News in their first TV interview, from an undisclosed location in the capital Minsk.\u00a0 \u00a0 The daredevils are professional musicians from Belarus' national Philharmonic, although the philharmonic does not officially endorse the flash mobs. Their protest began with a defiant performance on the steps of their concert hall, with folk songs that have become anthems of the opposition.\u00a0 When police started to harass them, they took their movement underground, and they were stunned to find regular people eager to join in.\u00a0 \"They were crying, they were thanking us\" said one of the musicians. \"We realized that art can move people and bolster their fighting spirit.\" The organizers now count roughly 400 members of the flash mobs, which they organize using the encrypted Telegram social media app. They send out notices of their flash mobs only about one hour beforehand, to prevent police from thwarting their efforts. It's a fight that resembles David and Goliath: Lukashenko, backed by his old ally Russian President Vladimir Putin, has deployed his military to quash the peaceful protests\u00a0in the former Soviet republic.  The Russian president recently wrote a check for $1.5 billion in aid to Lukashenko, and vowed to deploy Russian security forces across the border \"if necessary.\" The standoff has yielded Cold War-like imagery that has come to define Belarus in 2020. For now, it's a war of attrition, grinding on between Europe's so-called \"last dictator\" of 26 years and the people demanding he step down.\u00a0 But the musicians behind the pop-up protests say victory is already theirs.  \u00a0 \"We've already won. We have defeated fear,\" they told CBS News. \"Belarus' revolution has no single leader, except, perhaps, the music.\"   Chris Livesay is a CBS News foreign correspondent based in Rome.",

            "article_content": "A woman charged with making threats against President Trump by mailing a package containing ricin to the White House was ordered held without bail Monday by a judge in Buffalo who cited \"a very strong case\" against her based on an indictment in Washington, D.C. Pascale Ferrier, 53, of a Montreal suburb, was arrested a week ago as she tried to enter the U.S. through a border crossing between Fort Erie, Ontario, and Buffalo. Her lawyer entered a not guilty plea on her behalf Monday. U.S. Magistrate Judge H. Kenneth Schroeder Jr. cited a long history of assassinations and attempted assassinations of U.S. presidents since the killing of President Abraham Lincoln in finding that Ferrier was an ongoing threat to the president and others. He also read from a letter that prosecutors allege Ferrier wrote to Trump and included in the ricin-laden container, in which she allegedly threatened to find a more dangerous poison or to use her gun to stop him from his presidential campaign. \"It would appear to me the government has a very strong case, especially assuming the legal validity of the alleged admissions at the time of her arrest,\" Schroeder said of the woman, who has French and Canadian citizenship. He ordered her transfer to Washington to face the one-count indictment. The envelope containing the toxic substance and the threatening letter was addressed to the White House but was intercepted at a mail sorting facility on September 18. No one was harmed. Besides the letter's threats was a command to Trump to \"give up and remove our application for this election,\" authorities said. The FBI discovered that six additional similar letters appeared to have been received in Texas a few days earlier, according to a criminal complaint. Her lawyer, Fonda Dawn Kubiak, argued that she should be granted bail. \"As Ms. Ferrier sits here today, she is presumed innocent,\" Kubiak said. She called her client \"highly educated\" with the equivalent of a master's degree in engineering in France and who was employed by an aircraft engineering company. Kubiak said Ferrier could reside with her son in Quebec or possibly with family members in Texas. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Lynch said Ferrier was trying to enter the United States last week when an officer approached and asked if she was OK. \"No, I'm wanted by the FBI for the ricin envelope,\" he quoted her as responding. He said authorities handcuffed her and searched her vehicle, in which they found a semiautomatic handgun loaded with seven rounds of ammunition, nearly 300 rounds of other ammunition, pepper spray, a knife and a stun gun. \"She was loaded for bear, Judge,\" the prosecutor said. He said that ricin had been located at her apartment outside Montreal and that she was likely to face additional charges in Washington, Texas and Buffalo.",

Ferrier has been charged with making threats against the president of the United States.\u00a0 At her initial court appearance in Buffalo on Tuesday, Ferrier asked the court to appoint a federal defender, which will be paid for by American taxpayers. That defender requested an identity hearing, in which the court would determine that she is in fact the person named in the criminal complaint and the arrest warrant, as well as a probable cause hearing.\u00a0 Ferrier's next hearings, which will include the identity and probable cause hearing, were scheduled for September 28. She was returned to the custody of U.S. Marshals.\u00a0 Court documents released Tuesday detail how on Friday, the U.S. Secret Service flagged the letter postmarked from Canada to the FBI. The FBI found that it \"contained a white, powdery material,\" which was later confirmed to be ricin. The letter also contained a note Ferrier allegedly wrote to the president, calling him \"The Ugly Tyrant Clown\"\u00a0 and claiming he, \"...ruin[ed] USA and lead [sic] them to disaster,\" according to the documents. \"I have US cousins, then I don't want the next 4 years with you as president. Give up and remove your application for this election,\" Ferrier allegedly wrote to Mr. Trump. \"So I made a \"Special Gift\" for you to make a decision. This gift is in this letter. If it doesn't work, I'll find better recipe for another poison, or I might use my gun when I'll be able to come. Enjoy! FREE REBEL SPIRIT!\" The affidavit claims that Ferrier made similar negative comments about the President on her social media accounts. Law enforcement officials said they learned during the toxin screening that six additional letters sent from Canada had been turned over to FBI field offices in Texas earlier in the week. Those letters were allegedly addressed to individuals employed at penitentiaries and detention centers in the state. The letters also allegedly contained a powdery substance, had matching language, and were similarly signed \"FREE REBEL SPIRIT.\" Law enforcement officials said they were also able to identify her fingerprints on four of the letters in San Antonio. Ferrier was previously arrested in March 2019 by the Mission Police in Texas for weapons possession and was transferred into ICE custody. According to court documents, the letters sent to Texas were addressed to individuals that worked at facilities at which she was held during her detention in 2019. When Ferrier was arrested Sunday while trying to enter the U.S. from the Peace Bridge in Buffalo, she allegedly told CBP officers she was \"...wanted by the FBI for the ricin letters\" and had a gun and a knife in her possession.",

The two agreed that any legislation to keep the government open past the September 30 funding deadline should be \"clean,\" meaning absent of any controversial provisions. The informal accord comes as Congress remains in a stalemate over passing any new\u00a0coronavirus relief legislation. The stop-gap measure to keep the government open would sidestep any major funding battles ahead of the November election. A senior Senate GOP aide also confirmed to CBS News that the White House has reached out to lawmakers about a short-term continuing resolution until December. The last government shutdown occurred in late 2018 and early 2019 and lasted for 35 days, the longest in American history, after President Trump insisted on more funding to build a wall on the southern border. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany expressed confidence that a deal would be reached, telling reporters Thursday that \"we do believe that we'll be able to get funding to avoid a shutdown.\" The Senate is expected to return to Washington on September 8, and the House will reconvene on September 14. Although the House passed its own $3 trillion coronavirus relief package in May, the legislation is a nonstarter with Senate Republicans and the White House.

            "article_content": "Three months from Election Day, President Trump offered a loosely defined set of promises for his second term, some of which are based on the coronavirus pandemic and on the economy.\u00a0 The president articulated these six campaign promises during a speech Thursday at a Whirlpool plant in Ohio:\u00a0\u00a0 He also vowed to reimpose tariffs on aluminum from Canada, a country that the president said has not been fair to the U.S.\u00a0 Last month, Mr. Trump could initially offer no specifics when Fox News' Sean Hannity asked what he would do if he were re-elected. On Thursday, the president argued he should be reelected because he's kept all of his promises from 2016, although this is not true. \"I didn't back down from my promises, and I've kept every single one,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday. Mr. Trump was supposed to be greeted by Ohio Governor\u00a0Mike DeWine, a Republican, at the airport, but DeWine, an early advocate of strong measures to quash the virus, tested positive for COVID-19 hours before the president landed.\u00a0 A CBS News poll\u00a0in late July found the president has just a one-point edge in Ohio, a state he won by a comfortable margin four years ago. Ohio is also a critical part of the president's overall electoral map in 2020. While he has done some of the things he said he'd do \u2014 like renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and enacting tax reform \u2014 he's also failed to keep many of his promises.\u00a0 In the last three-and-a-half years, the president has not succeeded in repealing the nation's health care law, or in making any progress toward eliminating the national debt. He has also not released his tax returns, nor has he enacted a five-year ban to keep White House and congressional officials from lobbying, or built a significant part of the border wall at Mexico's expense, among other pledges.\u00a0 Plans for Mr. Trump's acceptance of the Republican nomination for the presidency remain unclear. He is mulling a GOP acceptance speech at the White House, which hasn't been warmly received by Republicans, who are reluctant to see the White House used for a purely political event. While it's technically legal, such a speech could pose problems for aides who, unlike the president, are subject to laws preventing them from using federal resources for political use.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The Justice Department scheduled two additional federal executions on Friday, an announcement that comes weeks after it fought off last-minute legal challenges and successfully resumed federal executions following a 17-year pause. The executions of Christopher Andre Vialva and William Emmett LeCroy are both scheduled to be carried out in late September. The government carried out three executions in July, and two other executions had been set previously for August. Vialva, 40, was convicted along with a co-defendant in the 1999 kidnapping and killing of an Iowa couple at Fort Hood in Texas. The youth ministers had stopped to use a payphone in Killeen, Texas, and agreed to give Vialva and two others a ride, authorities said. Vialva pulled out a gun, forced the couple into the trunk and drove around for several hours, stopping at ATMs to withdraw cash and attempting to pawn the woman's wedding ring, according to prosecutors. The victims, Todd and Stacie Bagley, were both shot in head and placed in trunk of their car, which then was set afire. Vialva, who is the first Black inmate to be scheduled to be executed since the federal government resumed the death penalty this year, is scheduled to be executed on September 24. A co-defendant in the case, Brandon Bernard, also received death sentence, though his execution date has not yet been scheduled. LeCroy, 50, of Georgia, was convicted of raping and killing Joann Lee Tiesler, a 30-year-old nurse, in 2001 and then stealing her car. Prosecutors said he broke into her home and attacked her when she came home from a shopping trip, binding her hands behind her back before he strangled her with an electrical cord and raped her. They said he then slit Tiesler's throat and stabbed her repeatedly in the back. At the time, one of LeCroy's lawyers argued he should face state charges and not be tried in federal court under the federal carjacking statute. LeCroy's lawyers said he had no intention of stealing the car when he was burglarizing Tiesler's home. He was arrested at the U.S.-Canada border and was previously convicted of firearms and drug offenses, burglary, aggravated assault and child sex abuse charges. LeCroy is scheduled to be executed on September 26. The resumption of federal executions by lethal injection at a prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, started on July 14, with the execution of former white supremacist Daniel Lewis Lee. Two others, Wesley Purkey and Dustin Honken, were executed later the same week. Anti-death penalty groups say President Trump is pushing for executions prior to the November election in a cynical bid to burnish a reputation a law-and-order leader. U.S. officials have portrayed the executions, particularly those of men convicted of brutal killings of children, as bringing long-delayed justice for victims and their families. There are currently 58 men and one woman on federal death row, all of them in Terre Haute. At least until this year, the federal government has not been prolific executioner compared to states. Combined, states have executed thousands of people over decades. But just 37 were executed for federal crimes between 1927 and 2003, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Thirty-four were executed between 1927 and 1963, including Julius and Ethel Rosenberg \u2013 put to death in 1953 for passing nuclear secrets to the Soviets. No federal executions were carried out from 1963 to 2001. And only three happened from 2001 to 2003. Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh was among them. The Justice Department announced an Aug. 26 execution date for the only Native American on federal death row, Lezmond Mitchell, earlier this week. Officials had previously set Keith Dwayne Nelson's execution for the same week in August. Mitchell was convicted of the 2001 killing of a woman and her 9-year-old granddaughter. Nelson was convicted of kidnapping a 10-year-old girl while she was rollerblading near her Kansas home, raping her in a forest, then strangling her. Lee, Purkey and Honken's victims also included children.",

Goya CEO Robert Unanue described Americans as \"truly blessed\" to have Mr. Trump's leadership in an appearance Thursday at the White House held to unveil Mr. Trump's \"Hispanic Prosperity Initiative.\" Not long after, #BoycottGoya, #GoyaFoods and #Goyaway began\u00a0trending on social media platforms. Goya Foods issued a statement later in the day that did not mention any of the hostility. Instead, an unrepentant Unanue repeated his backing of Mr. Trump's Hispanic Prosperity Initiative, established by executive order at the event. \"Our country faces a time of historic challenge but we will meet that challenge together and continue to work towards greatness, focus on a strong recovery, and hold onto the hope for a healthier future for all,\" Unanue said in the\u00a0statement. Unanue was more blunt on Fox News Friday morning,\u00a0telling\u00a0the conservative-leaning network: \"I'm not apologizing.\" The calls for a boycott of his company's products were an attempt at \"suppression of speech,\" he added. \"I'm not apologizing for saying \u2014 and especially when you're called by the president of the United States \u2014 you're gonna say, 'no I'm sorry I'm busy no thank you?,\" Unanue said. \"I didn't say that to the Obamas and I didn't say that to President Trump.\" Goya Foods, a family-owned business for nearly 85 years, features 2,500 products, from seasonings and cooking oils, to beans and other Latin American staples as well as frozen products and snacks. Goya offerings are ubiquitous in grocery stores across the U.S., sometimes taking up their own entire aisle. Those calling for a boycott of Goya products posted a litany of derogatory comments made by Mr. Trump as well as his policies, including his administration's separations of detained immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border. \"We learned to bake bread in this pandemic, we can learn to make our own adobo con pimienta. Bye.\" tweeted actor Lin-Manuel Miranda. Former U.S. housing secretary and Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro bashed Unanue on Twitter for extolling a president who he said has vilified Goya's Hispanic customer base, while Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said she'll learn to make some of the Latin American staples Goya sells.

Currently based in Jersey City, New Jersey, it has 26 manufacturing and distribution facilities in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Spain, and employs more than 4,000 globally. According to Federal Elections Commission\u00a0data,\u00a0Unanue donated $6,000 last year to Republican political groups. Many of those that came to Goya's defense Friday pointed out the company's history of philanthropy. This spring, Goya donated over 300,000 pounds of food, or about 270,000 meals, to food banks and other organizations as part of its pandemic relief effort. Last month, Goya showed up with thousands of pounds of food for families in the Bronx and Harlem who have been affected by COVID-19. \u2014 The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A coronavirus vaccine is still months or years away, but groups that peddle misinformation about immunizations are already taking aim, potentially eroding confidence in what could be humanity's best chance to defeat the virus. In recent weeks, vaccine opponents have made several unsubstantiated claims, including allegations that vaccine trials will be dangerously rushed or that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, is blocking cures to enrich vaccine makers. They've also falsely claimed that Microsoft founder Bill Gates wants to use a vaccine to inject microchips into people - or to cull 15% of the world's population. Vaccine opponents in the U.S. have been around for a long time. Their claims range from relatively modest safety concerns about specific vaccines or the risk of side effects to conspiracy theories that border on the bizarre. The movement is receiving renewed attention, especially as it aligns itself with groups loudly protesting restrictions on daily life aimed at controlling the spread of the virus. Health professionals say vaccine misinformation could have lethal consequences if it leads people to opt for bogus cures instead.  \"Only a coronavirus vaccine can truly protect us from future outbreaks,\" said Dr. Scott Ratzan, a physician and medical misinformation expert at the City University of New York and Columbia University. \"But what if the effort succeeds and large numbers of people decide not to vaccinate themselves or their children?\" While vaccines for diseases such as polio, smallpox and measles have benefited millions, some skeptics reject the science, citing a distrust of modern medicine and government. Others say mandatory vaccine requirements violate their religious freedom.  Rita Palma, the leader of the anti-vaccine group in Long Island called My Kids, My Choice, is among those who say their families won't get the coronavirus vaccine. \"Many of us are anxiety stricken at the thought of being forced to get a vaccine,\" Palma said. \"I will never choose to have a COVID-19 vaccine. I don't want the government forcing it on my community or my family.\" From the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, vaccine skeptics have tailored several long-standing claims about vaccine safety to fit the current outbreak. When the first U.S. case was announced in January, some alleged the coronavirus was manufactured and that patents for it could be found online. More than 200,000 deaths later, vaccine opponents are endorsing unapproved treatments, second-guessing medical experts and pushing fears about mandatory vaccinations. They've also latched onto protests against stay-at-home orders\u00a0in the U.S. \"The coronavirus has created this perfect storm of misinformation,\" remarked David A. Broniatowski, an associate professor at George Washington University's school of engineering and applied science who has published several studies on vaccine misinformation. Last week, an anti-vaccine activist was arrested in Idaho after repeatedly refusing police orders to leave a playground closed because of the pandemic. The woman, who was there with other families, is affiliated with two groups that protested at the Idaho Statehouse against stay-at-home orders. Facebook groups formed to organize the protests have been peppered with vaccine hoaxes and myths. Perhaps no one is a bigger targrt for conspiracy theorists than Gates, who is funding vaccine research. The online movement has centered concerns around a COVID-19 vaccine on false claims that Gates is planning to microchip people with the vaccine or use it to reduce the world's population. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic who helped popularize unsubstantiated claims that vaccines can cause autism, said Gates' work gives him \"dictatorial control of global health policy.\" Roger Stone, a former adviser to President Trump, went further on a New York City radio show, saying Gates \"and other globalists\" are using the coronavirus \"for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people.\" Such wild theories can have real-world effects. False rumors that Gates hoped to test an experimental vaccine in South Africa became mainstream after a news site erroneously reported the claim. One of the country's political parties then sent a letter to President Cyril Rampahosa demanding answers about \"deals\" struck with Gates. In fact, Gates and his wife are financing a vaccine trial in Philadelphia and Kansas City, Missouri, not South Africa. He also suggested creating a database of people immune to the virus, not implanting microchips.  On Monday, during remarks recognizing World Immunization Week, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus criticized vaccine skeptics for spreading misinformation at a time when many families are delaying or skipping routine childhood immunizations because they're afraid of COVID-19 exposure in doctors' offices. \"Myths and misinformation about vaccines are adding fuel to the fire,\" he said. Health experts have repeatedly said there is no evidence the coronavirus was intentionally created or spread. They also insist that vaccines are not only safe, but essential to global health. \"Vaccine researchers and anyone who is a vaccine advocate care deeply about vaccine safety,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a Children's Hospital of Philadelphia physician and co-inventor of a vaccine for rotavirus, which kills hundreds of thousands of children annually. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death for some people, especially older adults and people with existing health problems.  The vaccine debate is fertile ground for groups looking to sow discord in the United States. Russia seized on it to create divisions before the 2016 U.S. election, and appears to be at it again. A report from a European Union disinformation task force found numerous conspiracy theories in English-language Russian media, including state-run RT, claiming an eventual vaccine will be used to inject nanoparticles into people.  \"When pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets spread anti-vaccine tropes, they become responsible for those who will hesitate to seek professional medical care,\" the EU report said.",

Cuomo and the governors of several other eastern states announced Monday that they would join forces to coordinate the reopening of the region and its economy after the coronavirus pandemic upended regular daily life throughout the country.\u00a0 Hours after the governors' plan was announced, the president stood at the podium during the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing and said his \"authority is total\" in regards to lockdown rules across the country. \"It's not the law. It's not the Constitution. We don't have a king, we have a president,\" Cuomo said, stressing the need to work together through the current phase. \"We need a public health strategy and an economic strategy.\"\u00a0 The governor explained that the coordinated bipartisan effort with the governors of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Delaware and Rhode Island was done because the virus \"doesn't stop at a state border.\"\u00a0 \"To come back from this we should do it regionally and share information\u2026 let's put the best minds around the table, come up with a regional strategy,\" he said.\u00a0 Cuomo said the coalition had spoken to the White House about the announcement, and Mr. Trump's position that he had authority over U.S. governors was a \"total reversal of the president's first position.\" \"He has total authority to open up the economy \u2014 then why didn't he have authority to close the economy? Why did he leave it to the states and the governors to close it down?\" he asked. Cuomo pointed out that the president had, in the past, said it was up to the states to do things like purchase medical equipment. He called Mr. Trump's shift \"a total 180.\"\u00a0 \"If he wants to do more on the reopening, God bless. This is a daunting task for anyone,\" Cuomo said. \"You want to figure out how to do widespread testing, which the federal government should, do it. But it has to be cooperative and it has to be mutual.\" Despite noting the \"hyper partisan environment\" and the fact that \"the president is running for re-election,\" Cuomo said he was most concerned with Americans rather than agendas. \"I am going to work with the federal government, whoever it is, hand-in-hand because that's in the best interest of the people of my state. And nobody can do this alone, because nobody's done it before,\" he said.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The United States signed a peace agreement with Taliban militants on Saturday aimed at bringing an end to 18 years of bloodshed in Afghanistan and allowing U.S. troops to return home from America's longest war. Under the agreement, the U.S. would draw its forces down to 8,600 from 13,000 in the next 3-4 months, with the remaining U.S. forces withdrawing in 14 months.\u00a0 The complete pullout, however, would depend on the Taliban meeting their commitments to prevent terrorism.  President George W. Bush ordered the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Some U.S. troops currently serving there had not yet been born when the World Trade Center collapsed on that crisp, sunny morning that changed how Americans see the world.  It only took a few months to topple the Taliban and send Osama bin Laden and top al-Qaida militants scrambling across the border into Pakistan, but the war dragged on for years as the United States tried establish a stable, functioning state in one of the least developed countries in the world. The Taliban regrouped, and currently hold sway over half the country.\u00a0 The U.S. spent more than $750 billion, and on all sides the war cost tens of thousands of lives lost, permanently scarred and indelibly interrupted. But the conflict was also frequently ignored by U.S. politicians and the American public.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended the ceremony in Qatar, where the Taliban have a political office, but did not sign the agreement. Instead, it was signed by U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.\u00a0 The Taliban harbored bin Laden and his al-Qaida network as they plotted, and then celebrated, the hijackings of four airliners that were crashed into lower Manhattan, the Pentagon and a field in western Pennsylvania, killing almost 3,000 people.   President Trump has repeatedly promised to get the U.S. out of its \"endless wars\" in the Middle East, and the withdrawal of troops could provide a boost as he seeks re-election in a nation weary of involvement in distant conflicts.  Mr. Trump has approached the Taliban agreement cautiously, steering clear of the crowing surrounding other major foreign policy actions, such as his talks with North Korea.   Last September, on short notice, he called off what was to be a signing ceremony with the Taliban at Camp David after a series of new Taliban attacks. But he has since been supportive of the talks led by his special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad.  Under the agreement, the Taliban promise not to let extremists use the country as a staging ground for attacking the U.S. or its allies. But U.S. officials are loath to trust the Taliban to fulfill their obligations.  The prospects for Afghanistan's future are uncertain. The agreement sets the stage for peace talks involving Afghan factions, which are likely to be complicated. Under the agreement, 5,000 Taliban are to be released from Afghan-run jails, but it's not known if the Afghan government will do that. There are also questions about whether Taliban fighters loyal to various warlords will be willing to disarm.  It's not clear what will become of gains made in women's rights since the toppling of the Taliban, which had repressed women and girls under a strict brand of Sharia law. Women's rights in Afghanistan had been a top concern of both the Bush and Obama administration, but it remains a deeply conservative country, with women still struggling for basic rights.  There are currently more than 16,500 soldiers serving under the NATO banner, of which 8,000 are American. Germany has the next largest contingent, with 1,300 troops, followed by Britain with 1,100.  In all, 38 NATO countries are contributing forces to Afghanistan. The alliance officially concluded its combat mission in 2014 and now provides training and support to Afghan forces.  The U.S. has a separate contingent of 5,000 troops deployed to carry out counter-terrorism missions and provide air and ground support to Afghan forces when requested.  Since the start of negotiations with the Taliban, the U.S. has stepped up its air assaults on the Taliban as well as a local Islamic State affiliate. Last year the U.S. air force dropped more bombs on Afghanistan than in any year since 2013.  Seven days ago, the Taliban began a seven-day \"reduction of violence\" period, a prerequisite to the peace deal signing.  \"We have seen a significant reduction in violence in Afghanistan over the last days, and therefore we are also very close to the signing of an agreement between the United States and the Taliban,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday in Brussels.   He was in Kabul on Saturday for a separate signing ceremony with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper. That signing was intended to show continuing NATO and U.S. support for Afghanistan.  \"The road to peace will be long and hard and there will be setbacks, and there is a risk always for spoilers,\" Stoltenberg said. \"But the thing is, we are committed, the Afghan people are committed to peace, and we will continue to provide support.\"",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is proposing a $4.8 trillion election-year budget plan that recycles previously rejected cuts to domestic programs to promise a balanced budget in 15 years, long after Mr. Trump leaves office.\u00a0 While the proposal would boost the military and leave Social Security and Medicare benefits untouched, it proposes cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and other programs.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's fiscal 2021 plan, released Monday, promises the government's deficit will crest above $1 trillion only for the current budget year before steadily decreasing to more manageable levels. It also proposes cuts to several programs, including a 26% reduction for the Environmental Protection Agency.\u00a0 The budget had little chance, even before Mr. Trump's impeachment scorched Washington, of passing as-is. Its cuts to food stamps, farm subsidies, Medicaid and student loans couldn't pass when Republicans controlled Congress, much less now with liberal House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, setting the agenda.\u00a0 Pelosi said Sunday night that \"once again the president is showing just how little he values the good health, financial security and well-being of hard-working American families.\" \"Year after year, President Trump's budgets have sought to inflict devastating cuts to critical lifelines that millions of Americans rely on,\" she said in a statement. \"Americans' quality, affordable health care will never be safe with President Trump.\" The budget points to the administration's priorities, highlighting policies it may pursue in the future, the progressive think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said. The administration is likely to rely on \"various tools at its disposal including executive actions and litigation as well as legislation\" to accomplish those goals, it added. Mr. Trump's budget would also shred last year's hard-won budget deal between the White House and Pelosi by imposing an immediate 5% cut to non-defense agency budgets passed by Congress. Slashing cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and taking $700 billion out of Medicaid over a decade are also nonstarters on Capitol Hill, but both the White House and Democrats are hopeful of progress this spring on prescription drug prices. The Trump budget is a blueprint written as if he could enact it without congressional approval. It relies on rosy economic projections of 2.8% economic growth this year and 3% over the long term \u2014 in addition to fanciful claims of future cuts to domestic programs \u2014 to show that it is possible to bend the deficit curve in the right direction. That sleight of hand enables Trump to promise to whittle down a $1.08 trillion budget deficit for the ongoing budget year and a $966 billion deficit gap in the 2021 fiscal year starting Oct. 1 to $261 billion in 2030, according to summary tables obtained by The Associated Press. Balance would come in 15 years. The reality is that no one \u2014 Mr. Trump, the Democratic-controlled House or the GOP-held Senate \u2014 has any interest in tackling a chronic budget gap that forces the government to borrow 22 cents of every dollar it spends. The White House plan proposes $4.4 trillion in spending cuts over the coming decade Mr. Trump's reelection campaign, meanwhile, is focused on the economy and the historically low jobless rate while ignoring the government's budget. On Capitol Hill, Democrats controlling the House have seen their number of deficit-conscious \"Blue Dogs\" shrink while the roster of lawmakers favoring costly \"Medicare for All\" and \"Green New Deal\" proposals has swelled. Tea party Republicans have largely abandoned the cause that defined, at least in part, their successful takeover of the House a decade ago. Trump has also signed two broader budget deals worked out by Democrats and Republicans to get rid of spending cuts left over from a failed 2011 budget accord. The result has been eye-popping spending levels for defense \u2014 to about $750 billion this year \u2014 and significant gains for domestic programs favored by Democrats. The White House hasn't done much to draw attention to this year's budget release, though Trump has revealed initiatives of interest to key 2020 battleground states, such as an increase to $250 million to restore Florida's Everglades and a move to finally abandon a multibillion-dollar, never-used nuclear waste dump that's political poison in Nevada. The White House also leaked word of a $25 billion proposal for \"Revitalizing Rural America\" with grants for broadband Internet access and other traditional infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges. The Trump budget also promises a $3 billion increase \u2014 to $25 billion \u2014 for NASA in hopes of returning astronauts to the moon and on to Mars. It contains a beefed-up, 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure proposal, a modest parental leave plan, and a 10-year, $130 billion set-aside for tackling the high cost of prescription drugs this year. The president's U.S.-Mexico border wall would receive a $2 billion appropriation, more than provided by Congress but less than the $8 billion requested last year. Trump has enough wall money on hand to build 1,000 miles of wall, a senior administration official said, most of it obtained by exploiting his budget transfer powers. The official requested anonymity to discuss the budget before it is made public. Mr. Trump has proposed modest adjustments to eligibility for Social Security disability benefits and he's proposed cuts to Medicare providers such as hospitals, but the real cost driver of Medicare and Social Security is the ongoing retirement surge of the baby boom-generation and health care costs that continue to outpace inflation. With Medicare and Social Security largely off the table, Trump has instead focused on Medicaid, which provides care to more than 70 million poor and disabled people. President Barack Obama successfully expanded Medicaid when passing the Affordable Care Act a decade ago, but Trump has endorsed GOP plans \u2014 they failed spectacularly in the Senate two years ago \u2014 to dramatically curb the program. Trump's latest Medicaid proposal, the administration official said, would allow states that want more flexibility in Medicaid to accept their federal share as a lump sum; for states staying in traditional Medicaid, a 3% cap on cost growth would apply. Trump would also revive a plan, rejected by lawmakers in the past, to cut food stamp costs by providing much of the benefit as food shipments instead of cash.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014\u00a0Bill Taylor, who was until recently the top diplomat in Ukraine, pushed back against Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for an assertion he reportedly made in a profanity-laced interaction with a NPR reporter, during which he suggested Americans don't care about the eastern European country. In an op-ed in The New York Times, Taylor explained why Americans \"should care about Ukraine,\" writing that the country is \"the front line\" of the battle \"between democracies and autocracies, the contest between freedom and unfreedom.\" \"Until Russia withdraws from Ukraine \u2014 both Donbas and Crimea \u2014 and recognizes that Ukraine is an independent, sovereign nation, other countries cannot be secure. Until Russia recommits to a rules-based international order, Western nations are in jeopardy,\" Taylor said. Taylor was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, and returned to the country to serve as charg\u00e9 d'affaires at the U.S. embassy after then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled in 2019. He testified before Congress last fall about his knowledge of the campaign to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into President Trump's rivals. His op-ed comes after NPR host Mary Louise Kelly said Pompeo berated and shouted at her following a contentious interview last week. The interview ended abruptly after Kelly asked Pompeo whether he defended Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled from her post after a smear campaign by Trump allies and Ukrainian officials. Following the interview, Kelly, a co-host of \"All Things Considered,\" said she was brought to speak with Pompeo privately. \"Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?\" a fuming Pompeo said, according to Kelly. But Taylor rejected Pompeo's claim and said Americans should care about Ukraine as it is \"defending itself and the West against Russian attack.\" \"To support Ukraine means to support a young democracy, fighting to regain sovereignty over its internationally recognized borders. It is to support a nation that has broken from its troubled past to embrace European and Western values and that seeks to join European and North Atlantic institutions, to defeat post-Soviet corruption, and to give its citizens the chance to prosper in a normal country,\" he wrote. \"To support Ukraine is to support a rules-based international order that enabled major powers in Europe to avoid war for seven decades. It is to support democracy over autocracy. It is to support freedom over freedom. Most Americans do.\" A Vietnam War veteran, Taylor spent 50 years in public service before joining the United States Institute of Peace, where he was executive vice president. In May 2019, Pompeo asked Taylor to return to Kiev to replace Yovanovitch. Taylor testified before the House last year as part of its impeachment investigation into Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine. In text messages given to House investigators, Taylor told other diplomats that it would be \"crazy\" for the U.S. to withhold security assistance to Ukraine in exchange for help with a domestic political campaign, the charge that is at the center of the impeachment efforts involving Mr. Trump. Taylor also said he learned a member of his staff overheard Mr. Trump asking U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland about \"investigations\" a day after his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During that call, the president urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Both Taylor and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, who testified together, detailed an effort led by Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal attorney, that they said jeopardized U.S. foreign policy objectives. The two men testified they believed the lifting of the hold on military assistance was conditioned on Ukraine announcing the investigation into Biden and the unsupported theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election.",

            "article_content": "As presidential candidates compete for delegates in Iowa, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick will charter a bus 1,300 miles away, hoping to get an advantage in the nation's next primary contest in New Hampshire. The candidate is launching a six-day, \"all access\" bus tour through the Granite State from January 30 to February 4. \"This is a moment we cannot miss,\" Governor Patrick said in a statement to CBS News. \"This moment isn't just about replacing Donald Trump, but about pulling the nation together and bringing us closer to an America that fulfills her promise.\" Skipping Iowa, a move employed by the late Senator John McCain to jumpstart his 2008 presidential bid, proves risky in a crowded field of contenders jockeying for coveted \"momentum.\" Yet the former civil rights attorney and corporate executive has made no secret of his strategy: Courting voters who share a border with the state he commandeered for eight years as the governor of Massachusetts. \"Granite Staters hold a special power, and their decision will help determine the future of this country,\" Patrick said. \"I am grateful to have the opportunity to spend so much time listening to the people of New Hampshire before February 11.\" While Patrick jumped into the primary just a few months ago in November, he has made twelve trips to the state, campaigning eighteen days in-state with over 30 campaign events. He's spent more time in the state than former Vice President Joe Biden.\u00a0 In contrast to his New Hampshire visits, the former Massachusetts Governor has racked up nine trips to South Carolina, three visits to Nevada and a single two-stop campaign tour of Iowa. Boasting a \"Bay State advantage,\" Patrick's proximity to New Hampshire as Massachusetts' former governor grants him built-in name recognition, a nearby supply of volunteers, and outsized exposure in the Boston media market, assets that historically boost campaigns toward first-in-the-nation-success. Former Massachusetts lawmakers Mitt Romney, John Kerry, Paul Tsongas and Edward Kennedy all saw formidable upsets in New Hampshire primaries past. The recent dip of Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2013 the other lawmaker from Massachusetts \u2013 in New Hampshire could provide an opportunity for Patrick to leverage that advantage.\u00a0 But according to CBS News' latest New Hampshire Battleground Tracker Poll, Patrick holds just 1% of likely New Hampshire voters.\u00a0 The campaign got a boost on Friday with an endorsement from New Hampshire State Senator David Watters. Watters formerly supported Senator Cory Booker, and was an early endorser of then-Senator Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential bid. The six-term state lawmaker said he sees \"deep similarities\" between Obama and his 2020 presidential pick in their \"commitment to the American dream.\" During the \"Meet the Moment\" bus tour, Patrick will pay visits to local Democratic groups, students, and business leaders. According to the campaign, the presidential road trip will make stops at five New Hampshire colleges: Dartmouth, Colby Sawyer, University of New Hampshire, Franklin Pierce and Southern New Hampshire University. Patrick is set to deliver remarks at the New Hampshire ACLU on January 30, and to appear at the World Affairs Council of New Hampshire on January 31. Patrick is the second candidate to launch a bus tour in New Hampshire. Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg launched his own four-day trip last November. Senator Watters said he thinks voters will \"see somebody with hope, somebody who gets things done by asking people to come together.\" The senator quipped that a February bus tour is itself a true testament to hope, given New Hampshire's often-treacherous winter weather. \"I'm gonna get on that bus for at least a day. And we're gonna have a lot of fun,\" Watters told CBS News in a phone interview.\u00a0 \"We've had a tough two weeks in America, with the impeachment trial. And the primary is getting a little nasty, which is inevitable between the candidates. I think people will see that this guy is a lot of fun. He's going to bring a really good message.\" CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Alarmed by a deadly new twist in the nation's drug addiction crisis, the government will allow states to use federal money earmarked for the opioid epidemic to help growing numbers of people struggling with meth and cocaine. The little-noticed change is buried in a massive spending bill passed by Congress late last year. Pressed by constituents and state officials, lawmakers of both parties and the Trump administration agreed to broaden the scope of a $1.5 billion grant program previously restricted to the . Starting this year states can also use those federal dollars to counter addiction to \"stimulants,\" a term the government uses for methamphetamine and cocaine. \"Meth and cocaine are making a comeback and they are more potent than they were during the last wave,\" said Mark Stringer, director of Missouri's Department of Mental Health. He oversees the state's efforts to prevent addiction, get drug-dependent people into treatment, and support them in recovery. \"Where meth is much more prevalent than opioids, this will be a game-changer.\" About 68,000 people died of drug overdoses in the U.S. in 2018, with opioids involved in about two-thirds of the cases. Opioids are a drug class that includes fentanyl, heroin, certain prescription painkillers, and various chemical combinations concocted for street sales. But the national numbers also hide dramatic differences in the deadliest drugs across the land. In most states west of the Mississippi meth is the biggest killer, according to government data for 2017. Meanwhile, the highly lethal opioid fentanyl maintains its grip on the East and Midwest. Cocaine ranks third overall nationally in drug-involved deaths. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., whose state has been hard-hit by the opioid epidemic, said she was hearing from all quarters last year that the drug-addiction scourge is gradually changing. \"They were seeing much more impact from meth and from cocaine, substances they couldn't address because of specific language in the law,\" said Shaheen, referring to previous restrictions in the federal grant program aimed at opioids. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which writes spending bills, Shaheen said she worked with Republican and Democratic leaders to add \"stimulants\" \u2014 not only opioids \u2014 to the language of the 2020 spending bill. White House drug czar James W. Carroll said the Trump administration was also hearing calls for more flexibility from state officials, and supported the change. \"I know the term 'opioid crisis' is used a lot, and it's not my preferred way of describing what we're up against,\" said Carroll. \"I say what we really have is an addiction crisis.\" Other senators pushing to broaden the grant program included Republicans Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, also a member of the Appropriations Committee. Their states have been ravaged by opioids. Federal lawmakers don't want to be caught flat-footed if another drug crisis breaks out in an election year. The nation has been starting to see progress on opioids, with deaths declining slightly. Last week the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters to federal agencies requesting detailed information on evolving patterns of cocaine and meth use. \"We are concerned that while the nation, rightly so, is devoting so much of its attention and resources to the opioid epidemic, another epidemic \u2014 this one involving cocaine and methamphetamine \u2014 is on the rise,\" wrote committee leaders Chairman Frank Pallone, D-N.J. and ranking Republican Greg Walden of Oregon. Meth, which was once cooked in makeshift labs in the U.S., is now produced by Mexican cartels and smuggled across the border. The price of the drug has dropped even as its purity has risen. The increased prevalence of cocaine is being driven by greater supply, as cultivation of the coca plant has become more widespread in Colombia. Cocaine can also be laced with fentanyl, contributing to overdose deaths. As with meth, government data show the price of cocaine has dropped while its purity has risen. Treating people addicted to meth or cocaine is different from treating opioid dependence. There are FDA-approved medications for opioid addiction, but not for cocaine and meth. Instead, treatment relies on counseling and support to try to help people overcome their drug habit. It's a labor-intensive effort that carries a significant risk of failure. Access to more federal dollars will help pay for treatment, particularly in states that have held out on accepting Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Expanded Medicaid for low-income adults is a mainstay of treatment in states that embraced it. The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is preparing to notify states of the newly available grant flexibility. Ultimately, state officials want Congress to consider folding the opioid money into a larger block grant program administered by the same agency, creating a big pool of federal money to treat addiction, with fewer restrictions on its use.",

            "article_content": "Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, has been asked by Joe Biden to undergo\u00a0a formal vetting\u00a0to be considered as his vice presidential running mate, one of several potential contenders now being scrutinized by his aides ahead of a final decision, according to people familiar with the moves. The request for information from potential running mates like Klobuchar \"is underway,\" a senior Biden campaign aide tells CBS News.\u00a0 If a potential contender consents,\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0and\u00a0campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0say she should be poised to undergo a rigorous multi-week review of her public and private life and work by a hand-picked group of Biden confidantes, who will review tax returns, public speeches, voting records, past personal relationships and potentially scandalous details from her past.\u00a0 While several are expected to consent to a vetting, at least one potential contender has bowed out. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, who is running for reelection this year, declined Biden's invitation to be considered, according to a person familiar with her decision. But Senator Maggie Hassan, also of New Hampshire, has agreed to be vetted, according to local news reports.\u00a0 In a statement to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga, Hassan said, \"I'm flattered Vice President Biden publicly mentioned my name as someone he would consider. I am not going to comment about his process, whatever that may be. My focus each and every day continues to be serving the people of NH in the US Senate.\" Biden committed during a March primary debate to pick a woman as his running mate and has previously said the list of women is around a dozen. The selection process is expected to be closely tracked given that Biden's choice could set the course of Democratic Party politics for the next several years. The 77-year old former vice president would be the oldest man ever elected to the White House and has not committed to seeking a second term if he wins the presidency, meaning his vice president would be a presumptive front-runner in the 2024 election, or positioned to lead the pack in 2028. Biden has publicly credited Klobuchar for strong debate performances and for helping him win Minnesota, a victory that came only after she and other contenders dropped out just hours before March's Super Tuesday primaries that helped propel Biden into the lead. He is on track to officially clinch the Democratic presidential nomination next month after several states hold primaries rescheduled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Confirmation that the process is underway comes as several potential running mates have confirmed or dropped hints in recent days that they're in the mix. On Thursday, Representative Val Demings, Democrat of Florida, who represents an Orlando-area district and once served as that city's police chief, said in a radio interview that \"I am on the short list and I'm honored to be on the short list.\" \"If Vice President Biden asked me to serve along with him, I would be honored to do just that,\" Demings told SiriusXM's \"The Dean Obeidallah Show.\"\u00a0 News outlets have also reported that New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has told associates she's being vetted for the job \u2013 something her aides have strongly denied. And Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, told reporters last week that his Land of Lincoln colleague, Senator Tammy Duckworth, is also set to be interviewed by the Biden team \u2013 a statement Duckworth aides also disputed. The \"veepstakes,\" as they're known, include a certain level of public campaigning, fueled by glowing profiles in magazines and newspapers and public pressure campaigns by interest groups. VoteVets, a liberal veterans organization, is pushing for Duckworth's consideration, while Latino leaders are pushing for Lujan Grisham and Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, the first Latina senator. Several prominent African American leaders close to Biden are pushing for Demings, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, former Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams or former National Security Adviser Susan Rice. Biden has entrusted a four-person team to lead his selection process: Former Senator Chris Dodd, of Connecticut; Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Delaware; Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti; and Biden's former White House and Senate counsel, Cynthia Hogan. Former White House counsel Bob Bauer, campaign general counsel Dana Remus and former homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco also will be providing Biden with background and information on the candidates, according to the campaign.\u00a0 Biden has said he expects the vetting to be completed by July \u2013 and appears to be taking advice from the man who once tapped him for the number two role, former President Barack Obama. \"I need someone who's going to be, as Barack said, 'simpatico with me,' who is a real partner in progress and is ready to be president on a moment's notice,\" Biden said recently. \"There are a lot of women out there with the experience to do that job.\" FROM THE CANDIDATES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP President Donald Trump\u00a0traveled to battleground Michigan\u00a0today, stopping off at\u00a0Ford's Rawsonville plant, which began producing ventilators one month ago. Today's visit marked the president's third official White House trip to a political swing state in as many weeks. And while the Trump campaign has not held a campaign event in over 11 weeks, today's venture had the\u00a0feel of the rallies\u00a0the president misses, report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Adam Brewster and Nicole Sganga. \"We got to get back to the rallies,\" Trump told reporters, before taking the stage, adding, \"I think it's going to be sooner rather than later.\" The President said he is considering future campaign events in reopened arenas and \"big, outdoor\" venues, suggesting he might host his first rally in Georgia or Florida. \"I don't wanna have a stadium where you're supposed to have a person, then seven empty seats,\" he remarked.\u00a0 While speaking to reporters in Ypsilanti, Michigan, the president did not wear a face mask, despite Ford company policy requiring \"everyone wears PPE to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\" He told reporters he donned a mask during his tour of the back area of Ford's facility, but \"didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.\" From the presidential podium, President Trump thanked a room of union workers \u2014 members of the United Autoworkers of America \u2014 before jabbing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. \"I don't know how the hell these unions aren't endorsing Trump instead of the standard Democrat: a Democrat that doesn't even know where he is,\" the president said. Mr. Trump escalated his attacks on absentee voting today, stating nationwide ballot initiatives would lead to \"total election fraud.\" He offered no proof for this claim. \"We don't want anyone to do mail-in ballots,\" President Trump told reporters en route to Michigan, adding that there should be exceptions made in the case of illness.\u00a0 Mr. Trump voted by mail, earlier this year, in Florida's presidential primary election. He defended his action, Thursday, noting absentee voting was acceptable for individuals that \"live in the White House, and they have to vote in Florida, and they won't be in Florida.\" President Trump, a leading critic of vote-by-mail efforts, doubled down on threats to withhold funds from Michigan and Nevada if they proceeded in expanding vote-by-mail efforts, but declined to say which funds he would freeze. Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Atlanta tomorrow to meet with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says over the last few weeks, Pence has made visits to Minnesota, Indiana, Iowa, Virginia, and Florida.\u00a0 Georgia is nearing 40,000 confirmed positive cases of the coronavirus with nearly 1,700 deaths. It was just a month ago when President Trump criticized Georgia's Republican Gov. Kemp for his first-in-the-nation decision to reopen small-business sectors of the state's economy.\u00a0 On April 22, President Trump said he \"strongly\" opposed Kemp's plans and urged him to wait a little bit longer. \"I'm going to let him make his decision,\" Trump said at the time, adding \"but I totally disagree.\" Tomorrow, Pence and Kemp will have lunch and discuss the state's reopening plan.\u00a0 Afterwards, Mr. Pence will participate in a roundtable discussion with restaurant executives at Waffle House Headquarters.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0reports the list of participants has yet to be completed. But the discussion will be \"regarding the reopening of restaurants for dine-in-service,\" said Njeri Boss, director of public relations for Waffle House. Yesterday, Georgia's Democratic Party chairwoman Nikema Williams accused the Trump administration \"of making this crisis worse for millions of Americans by downplaying the coronavirus threat and allowing it to spread unchecked.\" Williams added that Pence \"ignored public health experts and endangered American lives. Georgians won't be fooled by Mike Pence.\"\u00a0 VEEPSTAKES ELIZABETH WARREN Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jack Reed led nearly a dozen other Democratic senators on Thursday in chastising two airlines for slashing employees' hours after accepting CARES Act bailout funds.\u00a0 \"Your decision to cut employee hours is inconsistent with congressional intent and is a blatant and potentially illegal effort to skirt your requirements to keep workers on payroll, and you should reverse this policy immediately,\" the senators wrote in letters to the heads of Delta and JetBlue.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0reports airlines have already begun receiving some of a $25 billion stimulus aimed at keeping their workers employed through September on the condition that they, \"refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing pay rates and benefits until September 30, 2020.\"\u00a0 The bill awarded $5.4 billion in aid to Delta and another $935 million to the smaller JetBlue. Although the airlines did not reduce hourly pay rates, the senators argue that cutting the number of hours employees can be paid goes against the spirit of the bill. A spokesperson for JetBlue, however, said that the airline was in full compliance with the CARES Act.\u00a0 He said that the reduced hours have been necessary because it is flying only about one in ten of the flights it typically would, and the bailout funds it received cover only three-quarters of its payroll costs.\u00a0 \"Given that our flights in many cities are completely suspended and are significantly reduced in others, there are quite literally no hours for our crew members to work in many cases,\" Philip Stewart said.\u00a0 Warren also continued to pressure the Federal Reserve and Treasury to attach strings that protect workers onto pandemic relief funds provided to large corporations. She joined Representatives Peter DeFazio and Lloyd Doggett in sending Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin a letter signed by over 80 senators and House members to call for a set of guardrails on bonds the government buys as part of the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility program.\u00a0 \"We seek some accountability rather than a blank check,\" the lawmakers wrote. They called for requirements that companies receiving aid from the Federal Reserve not issue stock buybacks, stock dividends or executive bonuses until the funds are repaid, as well as at least one seat on companies' boards be reserved for a representative elected by workers.\u00a0 They also asked that companies receiving aid be required to pay at least $15 an hour to all their employees by the start of next year. The letter comes after Mnuchin declined to commit to require that businesses receiving aid from the $500 billion Federal Reserve fund keep their workers on payroll as Warren questioned him in a Senate hearing Tuesday.\u00a0 LIFE AFTER 2020 CORY BOOKER New Jersey Senator Cory Booker introduced legislation that would expand voting rights and would create a federal organization, similar to the structure of the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, focused on administering elections safely.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says the organization would deploy 35,000 individuals, who would serve two-year terms, to states to help register and educate voters and serve as poll workers.\u00a0 \"The right to vote is sacred and we should make exercising that fundamental right as easy as possible,\" Booker said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the global pandemic has placed that right in peril, and unless decisive measures are taken to provide safe voting options, many Americans may face a terrible choice this fall between protecting their health and participating in our democracy.\"\u00a0 The bill includes some other measures, such as allowing people to register to vote online, that have been proposed from some of Booker's Senate colleagues.\u00a0 STATE-BY-STATE FLORIDA DNC Chairman Tom Perez made a virtual swing through the Sunshine State Thursday, participating in bilingual virtual conversations with elected officials and the Florida Democratic Party to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on Latino communities and small business owners.\u00a0 At least 74 people tuned in to the conversation Thursday morning, as Perez was joined in part by Florida congressional leaders Darren Soto and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell to highlight the importance of voting even amid the pandemic, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell. Mucarsel-Powell said Latino communities have suffered from this pandemic and may not be thinking about registering to vote but she insisted that they must because their voice is their vote.\u00a0 \"Republicans in Washington have followed the line of this president, attacking our communities every step of the way. I have heard them on the House floor calling us criminals. I have heard them saying that we're aliens, illegal aliens,\" said Mucarsel-Powell during the virtual event. \"Latinos are going to show the country who's in power, who's in charge, and who's going to be representing the Latino community.\"\u00a0 Thursday afternoon Latino small business owners weighed in on how the coronavirus has negatively impacted their economic bottom lines during a virtual roundtable.\u00a0 \"We're sitting in our tables in our offices, thinking how I'm gonna pay my rent, my mortgage, how can I pay everything if nobody is supporting me?\" said Claudia Mendoza, a Florida construction contractor. \"I'm my own support.\"\u00a0 Small business owner Rolando Chang Barrero said of Latinos who are struggling amid the pandemic, \"We do not have any other income sources, we are the frontline workers.\"\u00a0 He added, \"We are the farmers, the agricultural workers. We are the nurses, we are the custodians. We have to work. Most of the lower end workers, lower income skilled workers have never stopped working. They have been putting themselves at risk.\" During his remarks, Perez told the virtual roundtable attendees that in 2016 Mr. Trump visited communities of color and asked what they had to lose by electing him.\u00a0 \"The answer to the president's question, 'what do Latinos and others have to lose from his presidency?' Well, the answer is your job, your healthcare, your livelihood and your lives.\" MICHIGAN The Michigan Court of Claims has ruled in favor of Governor Gretchen Whitmer in a lawsuit filed by Republicans in the state legislature challenging her emergency powers in issuing an extended state of emergency, which gives her the power to issue executive orders like her stay at home order, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Adam Brewster\u00a0and\u00a0Jack Turman.\u00a0 The ruling will likely be appealed by Republicans. On April 30, Michigan's legislature declined to extend the state of emergency that was set to expire that day. After that move, Whitmer extended the state of emergency on her own, citing two emergency powers laws: one from 1945 (the EGPA) and one from 1976 (the EMA), which requires legislative approval after 28 days. Judge Cynthia Stephens ruled that the extended state of emergency, and power to issue executive orders, was valid under the EGPA, but Whitmer exceeded the powers of the EMA. But under the court's ruling recognizing her broad authority as governor, Whitmer would be able to cite the 1945 law in extending the state of emergency next week, should she decide to take that avenue. Judge Stephens said the EGPA \"empowers the Governor to act for the best interest of all the citizens of this state,\" not just particular regions, as Republicans argued.\u00a0 \"While the Governor's action of re-declaring the same emergency violated the provisions of the EMA, plaintiffs' challenges to the EPGA and the Governor's authority to issue Executive Orders thereunder are meritless,\" Stephens said. In a statement, Whitmer cheered the decision and noted that the ruling indicates that her \"actions to save lives are lawful and her orders remain in place.\" The ruling came the same day that Whitmer announced that retail businesses and auto dealerships will re-open by appointment on May 26.\u00a0Turman\u00a0reports Whitmer also said that nonessential medical, dental and veterinary procedures may resume on May 29. Social gatherings of ten people or less may occur immediately with social distancing being practiced. Whitmer, who ran for governor in 2018 with the slogan to \"fix the damn roads,\" commented on the underinvestment of infrastructure in the state in the aftermath of massive flooding in Midland, Michigan.\u00a0 She said, \"When you have 500 year events happening, 100 year events happening with more frequency, we know that this underinvestment is going to come with a very big cost if we don't take this seriously.\" NEW MEXICO The New Mexico-based founder of \"Cowboys for Trump,\" which has\u00a0attracted thousands of followers\u00a0online, says he was \"a little bit disheartened\" after Republicans in his state appeared to distance themselves from controversial remarks he made on Sunday, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Republican Couy Griffin, who also serves as a county commissioner in New Mexico,\u00a0had faced criticism\u00a0after saying \"the only good Democrat is a dead Democrat\" to cheers. According to a video posted by Griffin's group,\u00a0he quickly adds: \"I don't say that in a physical sense, I can already see the videos getting edited\u2026I say that in the political sense.\"\u00a0 The state party\u00a0tweeted Wednesday, \"The Republican Party of New Mexico wants to state for the record that any statements, whether in jest or serious about harming another individual are just plain wrong.\" Griffin\u00a0told CBS News of Steve Pearce, head of the Republican Party in New Mexico, \"I know Chairman Steve Pearce very well. I've known him for years.\"\u00a0 Griffin added, \"I feel like he could have...done the conservative movement more justice by being a little bit stronger than he was.\" The group, \"Cowboys for Trump,\" is not officially affiliated with President Trump's reelection campaign, which has not commented on the record about Griffin's remarks.\u00a0 NORTH CAROLINA U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar reportedly visited a COVID-19 testing site in North Carolina Thursday, just one day ahead of the state's transition into phase 2 of its re-opening strategy. Beginning Friday at 5 p.m. ET, restaurants, barbershops and salons can open at 50% capacity, childcare centers can open for all children, and people can gather outside in groups of up to 25.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the secretary's visit drew criticism from some of the state's Democratic leaders, like Congresswoman Alma Adams, who said in a statement that if the secretary wants to \"make a meaningful contribution to help North Carolina contain this virus,\" he should encourage the Senate to pass the HEROES Act. According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, there have been at least 716 COVID-related deaths reported.\u00a0 \"The Coronavirus has killed enough Americans to fill Bank of America Stadium and the Spectrum Center. COVID-19 isn't a partisan issue: it's a life and death issue,\" said Adams in an emailed statement. \"Charlotte doesn't need a photo op\u2014we need protective equipment and protections for workers, both of which the Trump administration has so far largely failed to provide to us.\" PRIMARILY CONCERNED PUERTO RICO The Puerto Rico Democratic party announced that the Democratic presidential primary will be held on July 12, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. The primary was originally scheduled to be held on March 29th, but was postponed to April 26, due to the coronavirus pandemic. The primary was further postponed from April 26th after the territory extended its lockdown through that date due to the pandemic. HOT TOPICS JOBS Millions more American workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, showing there are still staggering numbers of people losing their jobs two months into the COVID-19 pandemic. According to\u00a0the Labor Department, more than 2.4 million people filed initial jobless claims in the traditional unemployment system last week.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0reports more than 38.6 million workers have filed traditional claims since the week ending March 21, when many businesses were forced to close. Another 2.2 million workers filed claims under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program last week, a federal program for self-employed and gig workers. While the numbers of traditional jobless claims have been falling for several weeks, the Labor Department says over 25 million workers were still receiving unemployment benefits as of the week ending May 9. A U.S. Census Bureau\u00a0survey\u00a0released this week shows that among American adults, 47% say either they or another adult in their home has lost employment income since March 13. Thirty-nine percent expected either they or someone in their house would lose income over the next four weeks. KEY CONSTITUENCIES NATIVE AMERICANS In a statement\u00a0to the Arizona Republic, Joe Biden has staked out a new position on a key issue in Indian Country: guaranteeing funding for the Indian Health Services. \"As president, I'll make meaningful investments in Indian Country \u2014 including dramatically increasing funding for Indian Health Services and making it mandatory,\" Biden said to the Phoenix-based newspaper.\u00a0 Though some of the former vice president's former primary rivals\u00a0had made the same pledge months earlier\u00a0in the contest, Biden's platform\u00a0as late as March\u00a0vowed merely to \"ensure stable funding\" for the agency.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0notes the announcement comes as the president\u00a0of the Navajo Nation, which has been\u00a0ravaged by the coronavirus\u00a0and whose land spans thousands of square miles in Arizona, is\u00a0denouncing President Trump\u00a0for delayed aid to Native American tribes.\u00a0 \"So the amount of money that's being sent to 'Indian country,' as we call it, is the largest amount in the history of the U.S.,\" the president remarked during his\u00a0visit earlier this month\u00a0to Arizona, announcing that delayed relief funds would be freed up for tribes. \"And you deserve it. And you've been through a lot.\" MONEY MATTERS ON THE $$$ Presidential campaigns faced a Wednesday night deadline to file their April fundraising and spending figures with the Federal Election Commission, according to\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. And while both the Biden and Trump campaigns had previously announced their totals raised, the filing shed new light on last month's fundraising and spending activities.\u00a0 The Biden campaign filing showed the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee brought in $43.5 million in direct contributions in April after it along with the DNC previously announced they raised a combined $60.5 million that month. The campaign cash haul included $16 million in donations of $200 or less and $27.5 million in contributions over $200. At the same time, with the campaign taking place virtually, Biden's team spent just over $12 million in April, meaning they were able to keep its burn rate at a low 27%.\u00a0 At the same time, President Trump's campaign, which previously announced it, along with the RNC and related committees, raised $61.7 million in April, showed it spent just over $7.4 million last month. The filing also confirmed that much of the president's cash haul was brought in by joint fundraising committees which do not have to file monthly. \u00a0 Party committees also had a monthly filing deadline. FEC records show the Republican National Committee, National Republican Senatorial Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee were all able to outraise their Democratic counterparts last month in direct contributions. But that does not mean all three committees have more cash on hand moving forward. The RNC had more than $77 million at the end of the month, compared to the DNC's just over $40 million, and the NRSC had $37.8 million, while the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had $28.8 million. However, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had more than $82 million on hand, compared to the NRCC's $52 million at the end of April. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE After Congressman John Ratcliffe's\u00a0confirmation\u00a0in the Senate to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Texas Republicans now have to determine who takes his spot on the ballot this November. The Republican Party of Texas will have a Congressional District Executive Committee (CDEC), composed of the precinct and county chairs who reside in that district, meeting on August 8 to nominate a new GOP candidate for November. \u00a0 Its nominee would presumably win the seat in November, which has been held by a Republican since 2004 after Democrat incumbent Ralph Hall switched parties. As for the remainder of Ratcliffe's term, Governor Greg Abbott (R) has three options: He could do nothing and keep the seat vacant until the November election, he could call an immediate special election in the coming months, or he could have a special election for the seat on the November ballot, and the winner of that seat would fill the seat from Nov. 3 til January 3, 2021. In California's 10th District, a second batch of racist, offensive social media posts by Republican candidate Ted Howze is causing headaches for top-brass House Republicans.\u00a0First\u00a0reported by Politico,\u00a0Facebook posts under Howze's name compare \"Dreamers\" to pedophiles, target the Black Lives Matter movement and at one point ask, \"Can a Muslim ever truly be a good American citizen?\" The National Republican Congressional Committee confirmed with\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that Howze has been taken off their \"Young Guns\" program, a list of candidates the committee helps mentor and support.\u00a0 Howze is currently running to unseat freshman Democrat Josh Harder, who represents the Sacramento area district that Hillary Clinton won narrowly in 2016. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer both denounced Howze's social media posts, and McCarthy said he would take \"immediate action...if Mr. Howze is found to be the originator of these posts.\" McCarthy has not officially pulled his endorsement. In a statement to\u00a0The Modesto Bee,\u00a0Howze's campaign said that \"Dr. Howze agrees with Chairman Emmer and Leader McCarthy that these are disgusting and he absolutely disagrees with the negative and ugly ideas.\" His campaign has\u00a0previously said\u00a0the posts were not written by him and Howze responded to the stories Thursday night, dismissing the social media posts attributed to him as \"#FakeNews.\" \"They do not resemble anything close to my personal words or actions exhibited during my decades-long record of service in the Central Valley... We will not be bullied into a negative campaign or arguing over Brett Kavanaugh style attacks,\"\u00a0he\u00a0Tweeted.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign is launching a nationwide voter outreach effort in June to coincide with Pride Month and engage millions of LGBTQ voters ahead of the November presidential election, campaign officials tell CBS News. The coordinated outreach \u2014 dubbed \"Out for Biden\"\u2014 will target the estimated 11 million LGBTQ voters throughout the country, with a focus on racking up support in battleground states. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) estimates there are approximately 772,000 LGBTQ adults in Florida, 416,000 in Pennsylvania and 311,000 in Michigan who could deliver key votes. Other states where Biden's team has said it expects him to be competitive include Arizona, with approximately 242,000 LGBTQ adults, Minnesota with 175,000 and North Carolina with 319,000, according to HRC. About 50% of registered LGBTQ voters are Democrats, while 15% are Republicans, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0by UCLA School of Law's Williams Institute last year. These voters are racially diverse and also tend to be younger. About one fifth of LGBTQ adults aren't registered to vote. HRC also points to tens of millions more LGBTQ-allied voters who may be sympathetic to the equality cause. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, LGBTQ issue outreach is expected to continue to be virtual until it's deemed safe to resume campaigning in person. Virtual discussions are expected to be held on issues of health, race and sports, related to the LGBTQ community. \"Tool kits\" will be distributed with voter registration information and best messages to others to become equality voters. Biden's growing list of celebrity endorsers will amplify the importance of LGBTQ issues, too. One battleground-state Democrat who believes LGBTQ Americans could boost Biden in the battleground states is Senator Tammy Baldwin, the country's first openly lesbian senator. \"It is critical that, in this moment, as we speak out against racial injustice, discrimination, and harassment, we don't forget to do everything we can to empower people,\" Baldwin said in a statement. \"LGBTQ voters could be the margin of victory in Wisconsin, and in key states across the country.\" \"From the black trans woman in Milwaukee, to the Dreamer in south Texas to the pro-equality suburban woman in Bucks County Pennsylvania, the LGBTQ equality movement is ready to unite like never before,\" HRC President Alphonso David said in a statement. \"Our rights have long been on the ballot, compelling us to register to vote and participate in politics rather than let others speak for us and make decisions without us.\" The \"Out for Biden\" initiative will be spearheaded by a current group of 32 LGBTQ politicians and allies, officials said. Alongside Baldwin, six other openly gay congressional members will advocate for Biden, with more expected to lead outreach in their own states. Transgender leaders, like Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins, will also have a prominent voice. Jenkins is the first transgender black woman elected to public office in the country and has been a visible presence after the death of George Floyd in her city. The importance of LGBTQ rights was a common refrain for Biden on the campaign trail even outside of equality-centered events. He regularly repeated a story about when he was younger, and he saw two men \"in business suits\" kissing on the way to work in Delaware. \"It's simple, they love each other,\" Biden says his father told him at the time. LGBTQ couples frequently thanked Biden on his campaign rope lines for his early support of same-sex marriage in 2012. His advocacy for same-sex marriage went further than President Barack Obama's position at the time, and came before the Supreme Court's 2013 decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman, as unconstitutional. That law was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996 and\u00a0supported\u00a0by many high-profile Democratic lawmakers, including Biden. The Biden campaign has a number of LGBTQ people on staff. \"I was in the car and there were several of us and I looked around with all the staff helping out and I realized that four of them were gay men,\" Dr. Jill Biden\u00a0quipped\u00a0during a LGBTQ virtual happy hour about her Iowa campaign road trips, \"I got a crash course in gay pop culture last summer, I must say.\" And while progress has been made for gay Americans, Biden has placed specific focus on potential policy changes to assist transgender Americans. He blames the Trump administration for erecting additional hurdles and using \"the White House as a literal bully pulpit to undermine LGBTQ+ rights,\" as he said in a statement marking Pride Month. Biden has\u00a0pledged to reverse the Trump administration's ban on transgender military service members on his first day in office. \"They can shoot as straight as anybody else can shoot,\" Biden said in May. With executive orders and legislative actions, he also hopes to root out discrimination against transgender Americans in federally funded homeless shelters, ensure appropriate gender markers on government documents and force insurance companies to treat gender confirmation surgery as a \"medical necessity, which it is.\" \"Nothing about this will be easy,\" Biden said when accepting the endorsement of the HRC. \"I'm convinced the American people are with us. I've seen firsthand the incredible capacity to win some of these battles and soften impenetrable hearts.\" Bo Erickson is a reporter covering the White House for CBS News Digital.",

Brennan, who led the agency during the Obama administration from 2013 to 2017, offers new insights into the intelligence community's assessments of Russia's interference in the 2016 election, shares concerns about the potential politicization of the community's work, and discusses the merits of pursuing a career in national security. Brennan, now retired, also discusses details included in his new memoir,\u00a0UNDAUNTED: My Fight Against America's Enemies, at Home and Abroad.

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS \u2013 JOHN BRENNAN Producer: Ariana Freeman MICHAEL MORELL: John, welcome to the show. It is an honor to have you with us. JOHN BRENNAN: \u00a0Michael, it's great to be invited to your show. And I just want to say thank you for doing Intelligence Matters over the past several years, because I think it's critically important that more Americans really understand the importance of the intelligence profession and just how vital our national interests are in this day and age. So thank you again for what you do. MICHAEL MORELL: You're welcome. John, first off, congratulations on your book, Undaunted: My fight against America's Enemies at Home and Abroad. I've read it. It's extraordinarily well done. Lots of great stories, but more importantly, lots of important lessons. So I encourage all of my listeners to get themselves a copy and to read it closely. I also just want to highlight for all my listeners that you and I are friends. So full transparency is important in everything, including journalism. So I just want everybody to know that. JOHN BRENNAN: And former colleagues for over 30 years. MICHAEL MORELL: Absolutely. So, John, my original plan was to spend our entire time on the book, in particular aspects of it that may not get as much attention in your other interviews, but the news cycle demands that I ask you about three issues that have played out in the media in the last few days, and then we'll dig into the book. So the first, which you actually talk about in your book, has to do with the intelligence community's judgment in late 2016 about Russia's interference in the election. And what's played out in the media is that the analysts had done their work, they made an analytical call and you get a visit by two of your senior officers. Can you walk us through what happens there? And I actually think this is important because I actually worry that John Durham, the Justice Department official who's investigating the origins of the Mueller investigation, may actually get this wrong in his report. So I really want to take some time to go through that. So, what happened? JOHN BRENNAN: Well, thanks, Mike. And as you know, the CIA is the intelligence community's premiere, all-source analytic organization. And so the CIA was tapped to take the lead on drafting this intelligence community assessment, a very sensitive one on Russian interference in the 2016 election. It was the CIA, the FBI, the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the ODNI, that was responsible for pulling that together. The CIA probably had a dozen or so analysts, many of them very senior, who were responsible for putting this draft together. And they worked with their counterparts at NSA and FBI and ODNI. And then when the draft was done, there were several key judgments. One among them was that the Russians were trying to advance the electoral prospects of Donald Trump. And initially when that draft was done, all of the four agencies deemed that that judgment had high confidence of the analysts in those four agencies. Ultimately, the NSA decided that they were going to lower their level of confidence to medium, which, as you know, is not that much of a distinction from high confidence. But it's a distinction nevertheless. But there was certainly no argument about the solid nature of that judgment itself within CIA; CIA analysts, the authors of the assessment who were steeped in the intelligence, determined that they had high confidence in their judgment.\u00a0 Now, as you point out, there were two senior officials, U.S. CIA officials, who worked in that Russia Mission Center who weighed in with me to say that they believed that the confidence level of that one judgment shouldn't be at the high level. That should be at the medium level. Well, one of them sent an email to me and asked if they could talk with me. And so I invited them to my office and sat down with both of them. And for about 30 minutes or so, we talked it through and they explained their reasoning. I explained to them that I was very much deferring to the judgment of the analysts who were responsible for authoring the assessment, but that I also shared the analysts' views because in judgment, I had read through all of the intelligence, including the raw intelligence, and I encouraged the two senior officers to talk to the analysts about that judgment. They said they already had. But the authors, the analysts were unconvinced by their argument. Well, I said that I encourage them to do it again if they feel strongly about it.\u00a0 But what I wasn't going to do was to overrule the considered and consensus judgment of those CIA analysts who were involved in this issue and had authored that assessment. And I know that there's some press reports out there saying that I overruled those two senior officers; no, I didn't. I decided that I was not going to overrule the analysts who wrote that. And so, you know, managers, have the opportunity and they should weigh in. But at the end of the day, as you and I have both been managers of the analytic process, it really comes down to what those analysts determine, what their findings are, what they base those judgments on, and so that judgment at the high confidence level prevailed, as far as the CIA position. MICHAEL MORELL: So I think what a lot of people in the public might not get is that the analysts make the call, right. I think a lot of people would assume that, of course, the director should say what the analytic line is and they don't understand the culture of the place and how it works. Right. And what is really important here is to understand that you were actually doing exactly what you were supposed to do and not stepping in and changing the analytic judgment, which would have been considered by the analysts a serious problem had you done that?\u00a0 JOHN BRENNAN: \u00a0Absolutely. I would have been roundly and rightly criticized for overturning that judgment just because two CIA officers came in and weighed in with me. So whether or not you're talking about an individual agency product or an intelligence community assessment or a National Intelligence Estimate, the analytic views are subject to great debate, scrutiny and rigorous review. But at the end of the day, if a manager of one of those organizations decides to change the judgment, I think that is something that, again, is contrary to what the analytic process should be and needs to be. MICHAEL MORELL: So John, the second issue I wanted to raise with you is the letter that the Director of National Intelligence sent last week to the Senate Judiciary Committee about Hillary Clinton and Russian interference in 2016. The intelligence the DNI declassified and released, for my listeners, simply said that Russian intelligence analysis said that Hillary Clinton approved a plan in July 2016 to tie Donald Trump to Putin and Russian interference in the election. What was your reaction to the DNI's declassification of that information? JOHN BRENNAN: I thought it was a outrageous, appalling and blatant act of politicization that he released, very selectively, some intelligence that was provided then to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is right now engaged in, I think, a very partisan effort to try to debunk the necessary investigative efforts of the FBI that looked into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\u00a0 And I think it also just reflects that Donald Trump, after being frustrated with the first two Directors of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, who served in that position from the beginning of the administration, then Joseph McGuire, who was serving in an acting capacity. I think they refused to bend to Donald Trump's whims. But clearly, Richard Grenell, who served in an acting capacity before John Ratcliffe became the Director of National Intelligence. I think they have abused their authority and the position of the director of national intelligence in order to promote the very personal and partisan and craven objectives of Donald Trump. So I was quite appalled by that. MICHAEL MORELL: John, can you talk about how that information was handled when it was received in 2016? JOHN BRENNAN: Yeah, well, the memo that Ratcliffe released said that my handwritten notes showed that I had briefed President Obama and national security officials, the seniors, about that intelligence. And I briefed it for a couple of reasons. One is that I wanted to give President Obama and others a sense of the extent of our access and our intelligence collection capabilities against the Russians, to demonstrate that we did have this insight into what the Russians were doing, what they were saying among themselves and so on. But I also wanted to demonstrate that I didn't care whether or not they were Russians. We're talking about a Republican or Democrat or one candidate or the other. I wanted to make sure that I was blind to that political issue.\u00a0 And again, I'm limited in terms of what I can say about this, because Ratcliffe only very narrowly released something. But let's just say that what was within those quotes in the memo about Hillary Clinton approving this plan that was teed up by one of her advisers to highlight Donald Trump's ties to Russia as a way to distract from her email and server issue \u2013 let's say that was accurate, and I am not saying that at all. Far from it. But if it were, there is nothing illegal about that. And Ratcliffe's memo implies that since it was sent to the FBI as part of a larger report, that it basically implies that Secretary Clinton was engaged in illegal activity by doing it. Again, I'm not saying that that's what Secretary Clinton had approved, but even if she had, there is nothing illegal about that. And that would not have been the basis for CIA to refer that report to the FBI for follow-up investigation, for possible criminal activity. MICHAEL MORELL: So I infer from that and I don't know if you can answer this, but I infer from that that the reason it was passed to the FBI was because of something else that was in there? JOHN BRENNAN: Yes and as you know, I have not been allowed access to classified information. I was able to review some things during the Durham investigation that they asked me about. This was part of a number of documents that I was asked about. And I don't know exactly what Ratcliffe was referring to there in terms of which report. And I don't recollect what else might have been in that report. But again, I can say definitively that at least what was quoted in the Ratcliffe memo was not a basis for any type of potential criminal referral. MICHAEL MORELL: OK, and then the third issue, John, is the president contracting COVID. And a number of folks have said publicly that one of the reasons why the White House can't be transparent about the president's health is because of national security concerns. Can you just comment on that? JOHN BRENNAN: Well, as we're conducting this interview, I hear that Donald Trump is going to be released from Walter Reed in a few hours and listening to some of his medical doctors talking about his condition, they, I think, selectively release some things and don't release others, pointing out to HIPAA requirements in terms of privacy rights of individuals and patients.\u00a0 I do not believe that based on what I have heard and my understanding of the responsibilities of the medical staff of the president, that there's nothing in my mind that would negatively implicate national security by providing a more truthful accounting to the American people about Donald Trump's condition. There are some things that I think, you know, might need to be kept quiet, and that's when you could bring in members of Congress, the leadership of Congress or whoever else. But based on what I'm hearing right now, it doesn't seem like there is any national security issue that's being protected. It's more Donald Trump, again, understandably, you know, knowing who he is, is trying to project a image of strength, power, resilience, and I think just secrecy as far as his personal affairs, whether they be business and financial or whether they be health records. MICHAEL MORELL: OK, John, back to your book. Let me mention some people. Let me just throw out some names and ask you what kind of impact they had on your life, your approach to your career, your success, etc. So let me start with your parents. JOHN BRENNAN: Well, Michael, I've heard you talk about your parents and you know how important they were to you in your life. I was very, very fortunate to have both a mother and a father who really instilled in me a sense of distinction between right and wrong, which gave me a moral compass that I think was grounded in their religious faith. I was raised in a very religious household, a Catholic household, but also just gave me a sense of the importance of honesty, integrity, but also giving back to this country. I talk in the book about how my father is an immigrant to this country who came here when he was 28 years old and always told my brother, sister and myself that we need to give back to this great country of ours and not just take, take, take. So both of them were tremendous role models. And I miss them dearly and I think of them every day. MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0Your wife, Kathy. JOHN BRENNAN: Kathy and I got married when we were very both very young. We were 22 years old. And so we just celebrated a couple months ago our 42nd anniversary. And we've been through thick and thin together, tough times together. And it's very challenging, as you well know, for the family of CIA officers and national security officials to have somebody in the household that frequently is not there and even when they're there, that I am somewhere else. And so I've had to rely on Kathy to continue to encourage me to do the things that I needed to do, but also tremendous understanding. And I never would have reached my ambitions and my goals had it not been for her love, support and understanding. I just I can't find enough words to thank her for what she's done. MICHAEL MORELL: A CIA officer named Karl Ruhle? JOHN BRENNAN: You know when I got to the agency in 1980, I first started off in operations and moved to analysis.\u00a0 And after a couple of years under my belt as an analyst, I really thought that I knew a little tradecraft \u2013 until I met someone like named Karl Ruhle, who was my supervisor. And he just explained to me the difference between giving one's views and personal judgments and using information and intelligence and data to drive analysis.\u00a0 I remember one of the lessons he told me was that so many analysts use words like 'probably' and 'likely' and 'almost certainly' as crutches because they cannot martial the information and the analytic arguments in the data to drive their analysis. So he was somebody who I just really revered after he would take the time to mentor me and to teach me and somebody who was a tremendous role model for me as I pursued my intelligence career. MICHAEL MORELL: George Tenet. JOHN BRENNAN: George was one of my PDB recipients and briefees when I was Bill Clinton's daily PDB briefer, the President's Daily Brief down at the White House. George was the director of intelligence programs at the national security staff at the time, and he was somebody who was just a ball of energy and knew so much about the intelligence profession, about CIA. He had served as the staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee before he joined the White House staff. And when he was nominated to be the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence under John Deutch, he asked me to join him at the agency and give up my PDB briefing responsibility and become his executive assistant as his deputy. Well, George and I have ever since forged a very close relationship \u2013 again, friend, mentor, advisor, counsel and I served as his chief of staff when he was director, served as deputy executive director. And George is somebody who, in terms of integrity, in terms of work ethic, in terms of dedication to this country's security and to every man and woman who worked at CIA. He is an exceptionally talented but also an exceptionally thoughtful, generous person. And I've just been very fortunate to be associated with him during my career. MICHAEL MORELL: And I think he's had an amazing legacy. I mean, there are still senior officers at CIA who he mentored. All these years, you know, almost 16 years later, his legacy lives on. JOHN BRENNAN: That's a good way to describe it. It is a legacy. It's not just in terms of what he did while he was there, but it's those individuals that he really helped guide. And many of them are still there at the agency. And I think they're sharing what they learned from George with younger officers today. MICHAEL MORELL: And lastly, Barack Obama. JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I was very fortunate to work for the entire eight years of the Obama presidency. And I didn't know Barack Obama before he was elected president. I was a remote, long-distance, indirect advisor to his kitchen cabinet, to his campaign. And I relate the story in the book. When I first met him in Chicago the week after the election, and when he asked me first to be director of CIA and then asked me to to join him at the the White House, when that first offer didn't work out. And for the first four-plus years, my office was right below his in the White House, in the West Wing. I got to know him very well. I got to meet with him several times a day.\u00a0 Somebody who was exceptionally, exceptionally talented, exceptionally conscientious about carrying out his responsibilities as president and was very, very interested in making decisions that were going to optimize our national interests. But also, given that we both have been involved in counterterrorism over the years, carrying out the counterterrorism programs in the most effective surgical manner, that optimizes the safety and security of Americans and innocent people everywhere, but also minimizes to the greatest extent, any unintended harm to anyone. And I greatly admired him for his emphasis on doing just that. MICHAEL MORELL: John, I want to turn to a series of what may seem and actually are random questions, but I think our listeners will find your answers interesting. The first one is I want to ask you about ethics and intelligence. I often get a question from students: Isn't there an inherent conflict between the two? And you're one of the most ethical people that I know. How would you answer that question from the students? JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I don't know if I'm the most ethical people you know, Michael. I've tried to live by that North Star that my parents instilled in me. And, ethics I think need to be a part of anything anyone does in their life. It's one thing to abide by the law. It's another thing to engage in ethical and principled behavior.\u00a0 And clearly, the CIA over the last 70 plus years has been engaged in a lot of things that are very, very controversial and a number of things that I disagreed with, and that I had to really come to terms with sometimes during my time at CIA and sometimes before I joined the organization. But I do think particularly for a democracy and one that is founded on the principles, democratic principles that are embedded in our Constitution and that we are very fortunate to be able to have, I think that needs to be a good guide for what our intelligence and security services do. I do think it's critically important that we gain insight into the threats and challenges that we face around the globe. But I think there's a way to do it that will allow us to remain consistent to those values as Americans. I talk about in the book that there are a number of times when I was at the CIA where there were advocates of engaging in propagating false information about our adversaries. And I just don't believe the United States should be in the business of being a purveyor of misinformation, disinformation. I think there is a lot that we can accomplish, as much as we need to accomplish, we can do it with truthful information. And so whether or not you're talking about recruiting human assets, whether or not you're talking about different types of technical collection systems, I think it has to be looked through a dual prism of what is legal and what is duly authorized and then also what is ethical, principled and consistent with our values as Americans. And I recognize that that sometimes is a very, very tough combination to meet when there are national security imperatives and serious threats to our country. I think sometimes the CIA has gotten it right and sometimes we've gotten it wrong. So I think this is something that we have to learn from, every time that we're faced with one of these challenges.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: John, in the context of ethics, I'm going to ask you about something in the book: Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, what some people call torture. You've said before and you say in your book that you were uncomfortable with that program and that you spoke up at the time, but perhaps not as loudly as you should have.\u00a0 I want to ask you a different question about it, because I've actually thought a lot about this, and I think I know you pretty well. And I believe that if you had been the director at the time, I believe that you would not have approved the techniques. We don't need to debate that. But that's what I really believe.\u00a0 And my question is, what would you have done when the counterterrorism folks came to you and said that they wanted to do this and gave you a reason why they wanted to do it? What would you have told them? What would you have done? What would you have said to them? JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I think it certainly was imperative that the CIA be aggressive in the aftermath of 9/11, working with our foreign counterparts, intelligence security services around the globe who were in the process of picking up a number of these known and suspected terrorists. And they needed to be detained, arrested, captured. But the CIA had no history, no experience in conducting an interrogation program as well as holding individuals captive.\u00a0 And I think at the time, I would have tried to ensure the great wealth of CIA intelligence and counterterrorism experience be brought to bear, but that other elements that have had that experience, such as the U.S. military, which does detain people and capture people and also does interrogate, and that the bureau, the FBI, that has been involved in interrogations, debriefings, solicitation for decades, they were the ones that had that experience. But to ask the CIA to carry out both a detention and interrogation program in the heat of the 9/11 aftermath and basically stand up a program without that background experience, I think was asking too much.\u00a0 You know, the CIA culture is always to salute a order from the commander in chief. And that program was duly authorized by the President of the United States. It was deemed lawful by the highest legal advisory body in the executive branch, the Office of Legal Counsel and Department of Justice. It was briefed to the committees of jurisdiction. So I greatly sympathize with all those CIA officers who wanted to stop a recurrence of that horrific 9/11 attack. But that is the time where I think we should say, 'OK, we can do this part of it, but we need others to carry out some of these other areas of responsibility.' MICHAEL MORELL: Let's go from ethics to national security as a career for young Americans. I spend a lot of time on college campuses and I think many students today have a view that is different from the view that you and I had growing up, right.\u00a0 We believed that America, yes, made some mistakes in the world, but that it was generally a force for good. And many of the students that I run into today don't believe that; they believe that the U.S. has largely been a force for bad in the world and therefore they have real doubts about working for the government in general and for a national security agency like CIA in particular. What would you tell those students? JOHN BRENNAN: \u00a0First of all, Michael, like you, I try to spend as much time as I can now in my retirement, encouraging young Americans at various university colleges to give back to this great country of ours and encourage them to disregard all of the craziness in Washington right now and pursue a career in national security, intelligence, law enforcement, diplomacy, military, because this country really, really needs it.\u00a0 Are we an imperfect union? Absolutely. That's why the preamble of the Constitution says in order to form a more perfect union. Has the CIA made mistakes in the past? Absolutely it has. And unfortunately, some of them were very bad mistakes. But has the CIA and the intel community and the U.S. military and the state done things to keep this country strong and safe? Absolutely.\u00a0 And one of the reasons why I think it's so important for young Americans to give back to this country is that this is a very unique country. I do believe strongly in American exceptionalism, not because we are any better or smarter or more clever than anybody else. We have benefited from having such a large country with tremendous natural resources, arable land, navigable rivers, long sea coasts. And we're the melting pot of the world. And I think with that exceptional, great, good fortune, we have exceptional global responsibilities. And the world's peace and security really rests a lot on the United States' role in that world.\u00a0 Look what we did during World War II as far as stopping Nazi expansionism, imperial Japan, we were responsible for rebuilding the international system and the aftermath of World War II with the Marshall Plan, the international financial system. We have been the leader of the call for for human rights and justice and liberal democratic order. If we shirk those responsibilities, we really are putting ourselves at risk. And so, therefore, the CIA, if it carries out its responsibilities ethically and in a principled fashion, plays an integral role in ensuring that the United States is going to live up to, I think, not only its potential, but also its responsibilities. MICHAEL MORELL: John, let me tell you a couple of things that I worry about and get your reaction to them. One is, I think, thanks to their rhetoric and to the actions of President Trump and those who have enabled him, is that a significant percentage of Americans now see the intelligence community, to include the CIA, as the \"Deep State.\" Right. And that is not just going to go away with an election of a President Biden. Those people are going to continue to believe that. So how would you advise the leadership of the IC going forward to deal with that issue that a good chunk of the country sees them in a dangerous way? JOHN BRENNAN: Well, Michael, you and I would administer the oath of office to new agency employees in front of Memorial Wall. And it was one of the great privileges of our roles. And I can recall telling those new employees to disregard all of the political rhetoric and the partisan sniping that goes on in Washington, that the CIA and the intelligence community frequently is that football and the meat in the partisan sandwich. And I am concerned that what we've heard and seen in the last three and a half plus years really has been demoralizing because a lot of people are concerned that here we have somebody in the Oval Office who is dismissive of intelligence and denigrates the role and sacrifices of the members of the intel community, law enforcement and others. I think it's really incumbent on the future leaders of the intel community to speak out. Both you and I, I think, took opportunities to give public addresses when we were in office and to better explain to the American people. And yes, sometimes we're criticized for some of the things that we do or say, but I think greater transparency is the best way to undercut a lot of these allegations of \"deep statehood\" in the in the national security environment.\u00a0 And so I do think that if Joe Biden is elected, I think there's going to be certainly a new chapter. There's going to be much greater respect paid to these dedicated Americans by the White House and by the national security seniors. But I do think the intelligence community officials, but also members of Congress, it is so, so unfortunate that intelligence, the intelligence work is now the subject of great partisan sniping on the Hill. Years ago, when we both would go down and brief the intelligence committees of jurisdiction, I felt that the members would would hang their political coat and party coat at the door and they would really sit down and enjoy the discussion with us on national security matters and do it in a very bipartisan fashion. I think we need to return to those days. And I think it's incumbent on the senior officials in the executive branch and senior members of Congress to do exactly that. MICHAEL MORELL: John, the other thing I'm worried about is, is that nativism has taken over our politics. And patriotism, right, is required to serve one's country, and I just wonder if those two things, nativism and patriotism, are at the end of the day inconsistent with each other? JOHN BRENNAN: They very much are. Patriotism, to me, connotes a sense of real pride and devotion and commitment to your country, to your state and to what it stands for and what it is. Nativism is more looking at things in a very sort of myopic way and almost an us-versus-them. I know that nativism has taken root in so many countries, not just in the United States, because people are reacting to sometimes foreign influences and people are concerned about encroachment on their culture or their language, on their jobs and other things. And that's why I think Donald Trump's mantra of \"America First, America First\" is really shrill on the ears of a lot of people around the world because they believe that the United States is going to pursue this nativist policy, that we're going to leverage our muscularity in economics, finance, you know, political and military spheres to better us and to disadvantage others.\u00a0 While patriotism, I think, recognizes that you have a responsibility to your country, to your fellow citizens, but it doesn't come at the exclusion of trying to ensure that the world as a whole becomes a better place because of the efforts of your country. So I very much am concerned about the growth of nativism here in this country, particularly, as you know, xenophobia has really taken hold in so many places. But I think this is all part of the globalization that we're becoming much more interconnected. And unfortunately, a lot of people feel threatened by these changes. And I do think that our politicians and government officials have to be more honest with their people, with our citizenry, as opposed to fueling the animus that unfortunately is in evidence in so many places. MICHAEL MORELL: I guess this takes us to maybe the most important question, which is the health and even the sustainability of our democracy. Obviously, it's an important question for everybody, but I do think that career intelligence officers have a special perspective because they've watched so many countries over the years, you know, struggle with democracy in some countries, even lose it. So how worried are you, John, about our democracy? JOHN BRENNAN: I am worried about it. And democracy is a process. It's not a static state in my mind. Michael, you and I were working \u2013\u00a0 I was at the White House. You were at CIA during the Arab Spring. And I remember that there were a lot of folks who thought that if you just got rid of those authoritarian rulers that, democracy is going to flourish in the Arab world. Well, democracy is not like a light switch. You just can't flip it on and off. And although we are the oldest democracy and I think in many respects the strongest democracy, it is still fragile because our laws and our Constitution have given us a guide for how we can ensure that democracy is going to flourish here. But it really comes down to whether or not individuals in positions of authority, from the president on down, are going to honor the spirit of those democratic principles, or are they going to try to circumvent those principles and undercut them?\u00a0 And so the impact of Donald Trump and unfortunately so many others who have turned a blind eye to his trampling of our democracy as well as enabled it. And I am just so disappointed in the many members of the Republican Party. I'm neither a Democrat or Republican and I worked for Republican administrations, had great respect for them. But to listen to a number of those Republican senators and members of the House of Representatives just willfully and purposely mislead the American public about what Donald Trump is doing is just \u2013 it's very unfortunate.\u00a0 So I am concerned that what we've seen over the past number of years is eroding some of those foundation stones of our democracy. And just like how I think we need to adapt to the realities of the 21st century as far as governance and governance is really much more difficult today than it was 50 years ago. Same thing with capitalism. I think what we need to do is to see how we can refine some of these democratic and capitalistic principles in order to ensure equal opportunity, equal justice for all. And unfortunately, there is too much inequality at this this time, both on the social and political front as well as on the economic front, that really does, I think, inhibit our further development in order to form that more perfect union. MICHAEL MORELL: John, you've been terrific with your time. I just want to ask a couple more questions. You undertook something at the agency when you were a director called 'modernization.' What was that? What were you trying to accomplish? And what impact do you think it's had so far? JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I recognize that the world has changed significantly since the agency was first stood up, you know, 75 years ago. And that's the global ecosystem, the operating environment for the CIA. And we needed to adapt to the new realities of the 21st century. And I was always impressed as a young officer in how the US military was able to better integrate its capabilities as a result of the Goldwater Nichols Act, bringing together the services, the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force, and have unified chains of command and combatant commands overseas, like in Central Command or European Command and so on. And I believed that the agency could do that better.\u00a0 I had worked in the Counterterrorism Center, which was the first experiment in CIA back in the early 80s, mid-80s to bring together the different components of the agency to work in a more integrated fashion. So when I returned to the agency as director in 2013, I was determined to try to position the agency to deal with the challenges of the future and that evolving 21st century ecosystem. And although I'm a liberal arts guy, you know, I tend to be enamored with systems engineering and trying to figure out the best design for the interoperability of systems and people and capabilities and authorities and data.\u00a0 And so we basically overhauled the CIA structure so that you brought together all those different disciplines and skills and areas of responsibility and authority so that you can have a combined effort. When you are looking at Russia or China, are you looking at functional issues that you're not going to just have a series of stovepipes in the agency, you're going to have a much more matrixed and integrated model. And I think so far it has it has worked out; some tweaks to be made, which are inevitable.\u00a0 People used to ask me when I was at the agency, 'When is this modernization process going to be over?' And I said, 'No, it's never going to be over. It's a process of continuous improvement and adaptation to that changing environment that we work in.' And whether or not you're a government agency or department or you're a business or even academic institution, if you don't take into account all the changes in that ecosystem of which you are a part, you are going to be left behind. And so you have to continuously change and adapt to those new realities, particularly in a in a technologically driven and technologically revolutionary world. MICHAEL MORELL: So John, that's one significant reform at CIA. Do you think the intelligence community more broadly needs major reforms? JOHN BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, I think there needs to be a regular review. Now, the U.S. intelligence community, as you well know, is rather large, cumbersome, in some respects unwieldy. And I am personally glad that the position of the Director of National Intelligence was created as a result of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, because when I was, I served as George Tenet's chief of staff, George had the CIA director hat on and the head of the intel community hat on. And those are very challenging and they're both very full-time jobs.\u00a0 So having Jim Clapper serve as the Director of National Intelligence when I was the director of CIA, it really allowed me to focus on all the different things that CIA has to do. Now, we are about 16 years from that seminal legislative reform effort in the IRTPA. And I do think it's worthwhile to take a fresh look at what that legislation got right, what needs to be refined and tweaked. But I would very much counsel against going back to the old model that brings together those roles of Director of National Intelligence and Director of CIA. It's just too much for one person to be able to do well in this day and age. MICHAEL MORELL: Not to mention being the president's intelligence advisor, right, which takes a tremendous amount of your time on top of both of those roles. So, John, the other thing I wanted to ask you about was you're very vocal and visible support when you were director for the LGBTQ community at the agency. Talk a little bit about why diversity and inclusion was so important to you as director. JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I think there are a couple of reasons. You know, a very fundamental one, I think one that is incontrovertible, is that I don't believe any agency can make a better case for diversity than CIA. CIA is supposed to be this government's, this country's eyes and ears around the globe. And this is a pretty diverse globe. And if we're not able to tap into the diversity that is in America so that we have better insight into the culture, the languages, the people, the politics abroad, well, bad on us. And so just from a business case perspective, we really needed to emphasize that. Secondly, though, and probably even more fundamentally, is that America, in my mind, stands for something. It stands for an inclusivity that really recognizes that we have come to this country \u2013 except for the Native Americans \u2013 and everybody else can trace their roots to somewhere else around this globe. And I think a lot of our ancestors were subject to a lot of bias and discrimination. And I believe it's really incumbent on the U.S. government to be the leading light on diversity and inclusion.\u00a0 And Michael, when you and I first joined the agency back in the early 1980s, individuals of the LGBTQ community could not even get a security clearance. They were ostracized and they had to live these very hidden and secretive lives. And I just felt that I knew some of the individuals who went through that very, very painful journey themselves in the agency. And it was time for the agency to ensure that we were very proactive in terms of ensuring that all races, all ethnicities, all religions, all sexual orientations, people with disabilities, everybody in the agency felt as though they had equal opportunity to join the agency and to flourish within the agency and thrive. And like you, I was a very strong advocate of the LGBT community. I wore my Rainbow lanyard. And as I relate in the book, during my tenure, there were countless officers that would come up to me and just say, 'Thank you so much for having a very sort of a physical support and noticeable support to that community.' It it makes a difference in their lives. And again, if you really believe in the American experiment and what America is, it is something that I think there's no way that you cannot not support and endorse the diversity inclusion initiatives that thankfully have gained traction in this country. And that's one of the things I was concerned about when Donald Trump was elected, because there were many CIA officers, women and others who came up to me worried that there was going to be a reversal of some of those practices and policies. MICHAEL MORELL: The book is UNDAUNTED: My Fight Against America's Enemies, at Home and Abroad. The author is John Brennan. John, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for spending your time with us. JOHN BRENNAN: Thank you, Michael. I really enjoyed it.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "During their first presidential debate, President Trump and Joe Biden made a number of claims that raised questions. CBS News' fact-checking team examined the truth of some of them. Here's what we found. TRUMP STATEMENT:\u00a0\"Take a look at West Virginia \u2014 mailmen selling the ballots. They're being sold. They're being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country.\" CLAIM: Trump says mailmen in West Virginia are \"selling the ballots\" FACT CHECK: False DETAILS: A West Virginia mail carrier pleaded guilty to attempted election fraud and \"injury to the mail\" after admitting he had altered the mail-in request forms for absentee ballots from eight voters in April 2020, according to a\u00a0statement by the Department of Justice. The West Virginia secretary of state's office investigated and found that party affiliations on five ballot request forms had been altered from \"Democrat\" to \"Republican.\" The three other ballot request forms had been altered, though the party affiliation had not been changed. There were no charges of selling ballots brought against the mailman. BY: Sara Cook TRUMP STATEMENT:\u00a0\"They're losing 30 and 40 percent. It's a fraud. It's a fraud and it's a shame.\" CLAIM:\u00a0Trump says \"they're\" (an unknown entity) \"losing 30 and 40 percent\" of ballots.\u00a0 FACT CHECK:\u00a0False DETAILS: Mr. Trump says \"they're\" \u2014 an unknown entity that's presumably the U.S. Postal Service or possibly election stations \u2014 losing \"30 and 40%\" of mail-in ballots. There seems to be no source or basis for this claim. The president has mentioned this \"30 and 40%\" figure in\u00a0a recent interview with Fox News. However, he has previously used different percentages when talking about lost ballots. He\u00a0said in August\u00a0that \"20%\" of ballots are lost by the post office, and later in that same speech said it was \"20 to 30%.\"\u00a0 He may be alluding to the recent ballot problems in Paterson, New Jersey, where election officials ended up throwing out 19% of submitted ballots. However, that was the percentage of ballots that were deemed invalid, not the percentage lost in the mail. Several states have previously \u2014 even recently \u2014 reported problems with incorrect or incomplete ballots, but there seems to be no evidence of any state ever reporting that 30 to 40% of ballots being \"lost.\" BY: Kristin Brown TRUMP STATEMENT:\u00a0\"If you look at New York, where it's going up like nobody's ever seen anything, the numbers are going up 100, 150, 200% of crime.\" CLAIM: Trump says crime has increased 100-200% in New York. FACT CHECK: Misleading DETAILS: The New York Police Department\u00a0released citywide crime statistics\u00a0on September 3, 2020 for the month of August. BY: Sara Cook TRUMP STATEMENT: \"They (The Obama administration) had the slowest recovery \u2014 economic recovery \u2014 since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also they took over something that was downhill.\" CLAIM:\u00a0Trump said President Obama and Biden presided over the slowest economic recovery since 1929. FACT CHECK: False THE DETAILS:\u00a0While economists have pointed out that the economy was unusually slow to snap back after the downturn of 2008-2009, Mr. Trump is wrong when he says it was the slowest recovery since the Great Depression of 1929. In fact, the 2001 recession brought on by the dotcom boom that popped around March of 2001, was slower than the 2008-2009 recovery under Mr. Obama. Six years after the 2001 recession ended, the number of jobs had grown by just 6%, compared with 8% six years after the economic collapse of the Great Recession. The recovery that started during Mr. Obama's presidency was also longer than the 2001 recovery as well. The U.S. economy added 2.3 million jobs in the last year of the Obama administration.\u00a0 Mr. Trump said that the corporate tax cuts that were passed in late 2017 created a huge uptick in jobs. In fact, 2.3 million jobs were created in the year following the tax cuts, roughly the same as during the last year of Mr. Obama's presidency, and only 200,000 more than the year before the tax cuts. In the second year after the tax cuts passed by Republicans and signed by Mr. Trump, job growth dropped by 180,000. BY: Stephen Gandel BIDEN-TRUMP EXCHANGE: BIDEN:\u00a0\"You know his own former spokesperson said, you know, riots and chaos and violence help his cause. That's what this is about. \u00a0 TRUMP: \"I don't know who said that.\" \u00a0 BIDEN: \"I do.\" \u00a0 TRUMP: \"Who?\"\u00a0 BIDEN: \"Kellyanne Conway\" \u00a0 TRUMP: \"I don't think she said that.\"\u00a0 FACT CHECK:\u00a0True DETAILS:\u00a0In defending Mr. Trump, Conway cited polling that suggested that people want more law enforcement in their cities, specifically African American and Hispanic citizens. She made these comments in an interview on \"Fox & Friends.\"\u00a0 She began by quoting an unnamed businesswoman from Wisconsin. \"I was thinking of a very specific small businesswoman,\" Conway said. \"She got her store ready all over again for the post-COVID lockdown lifting, and then had to do it all over again after she was vandalized and looted. And this just can't stand. I also noticed there was a quote today from a restaurateur in Wisconsin saying, 'Are you protesters trying to get Donald Trump reelected?'\" \"He knows, full stop, and I guess Mayor Pete knows, full stop, that the more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who's best on public safety and law and order.\" BY:\u00a0Adam Aigner-Treworgy TRUMP STATEMENT:\u00a0\"The mayor of Moscow, his wife, gave your son three and a half million dollars.\" CLAIM:\u00a0\u00a0Hunter Biden received financial compensation from Elena Baturina for consultancy work. FACT CHECK:\u00a0Misleading, no evidence THE DETAILS:\u00a0\u00a0President Trump was referencing a claim made in a recent\u00a0controversial report\u00a0issued by the Republican majority on the Senate Finance and Homeland Security Committees.\u00a0 The\u00a0report, which follows a yearlong investigation mounted by Republican Senators Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affair Committee, alleges that \"Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.\"\u00a0 The GOP report claims that the money was transferred during a \"consultancy agreement\" between Baturina and Rosemont Seneca Thornton, an investment firm it alleges was co-founded by Hunter Biden. An attorney for Hunter Biden has repeatedly denied that his client co-founded the company, and therefore did not receive the $3.5 million. \"Hunter Biden had no interest in and was not a co-founder of Rosemont Seneca Thornton, so the claim that he was paid $3.5 million is false,\" Hunter Biden's lawyer George Mesires\u00a0told PolitiFact. Grassley and Johnson said the report was focused solely on records from the Obama administration and the consulting firm Blue Star Strategies, but have not publicly shared any documents that can substantiate their claim about the former vice president's son. According to\u00a0PolitiFact, Democratic Senate staff who've seen the documents referenced by Republicans said they don't tie Biden to an account for the company. Politifact noted that Hunter Biden had co-founded a firm called\u00a0Rosemont Seneca\u00a0in 2009, but it's not possible to know whether Rosemont Seneca Thornton involves Hunter Biden without access to the ownership documents of the entitity, which is private. \"The partnership with Thornton \u2014 even though it uses the Rosemont Seneca name \u2014 could exist without other partners in Rosemont Seneca having a stake. A business partner could have created this entity on his own,\" Politifact said.  Top Democrats on both committees have dismissed Grassley and Johnson's investigation, calling it \"an attempted political hit job facilitated by the State Department\" that is spreading Russian disinformation. BY: Audrey McNamara TRUMP STATEMENT: \"A fixing of the VA \u2014 which was a mess under [Obama] \u2014 308,000 people died because they didn't have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets.\" CLAIM: 308,000 veterans died because they \"didn't have proper health care\" at the VA. FACT CHECK:\u00a0Misleading The president's number was off, and his details were wrong. He appears to be referencing a report issued in 2015 that found that some 307,000 records stalled in the VA healthcare system. These were for veterans who were deceased. Some framed this as evidence these veterans may have died waiting for VA health care, but the report specifically says the data was so poor that it cannot verify how many of those records were for veterans \"who applied for health care benefits or when they may have applied.\" The report also analyzed records going back many years, and found that more than 250,000 of the veterans later identified as deceased had died before 2010. DETAILS:\u00a0Here are the\u00a0VA\u00a0inspector general's\u00a0report\u00a0and two quotes relevant to this claim. \"ES\" refers to the Enrollment System of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA): \"As of September 2014, more than 307,000 pending ES records, or about 35 percent of all pending records, were for individuals reported as deceased by the Social Security Administration,\" the report said, adding that because of \"data limitations,\" \"we could not determine specifically how many pending ES records represent veterans who applied for health care benefits.\" The enrollment program \"did not effectively define, collect, and manage enrollment data,\" and VHA \"lacked adequate procedures to identify date of death information and implement necessary updates to the individual's status.\" Later, the report is more specific. \"[P]ending ES records included entries for individuals reported to be deceased,\" it said. \"As of September 30, 2014, over 307,000 pending ES records were for individuals reported as deceased by the Social Security Administration (SSA). However, due to the data weaknesses identified in Allegation 1, we cannot determine specifically how many pending ES records represent veterans who applied for health care benefits or when they may have applied.\"\u00a0 Citing one record for a veteran who died in 1993, the report notes when the individuals whose records were stalled had been recorded as deceased in the Social Security Administration's database: It appears that a number of deaths did take place during the Obama administration, perhaps as many as 50,000 or more. But this report clearly states that the vast majority occurred before Obama took office.\u00a0 On Mr. Trump's claim of a \"91% approval rating at the VA,\" a\u00a02019\u00a0survey\u00a0released by the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. found that 90% of veterans would recommend VA care to fellow veterans. Here's the relevant quote from the VA press release:\u00a0 \"The survey, which asked Veterans about their experience with VA health care since the\u00a0MISSION\u00a0Act\u00a0was implemented, found that more than 80% were satisfied with their VA health care. Nearly 75% of Veteran respondents reported improvements at their local VA, and more than 90% would recommend VA care to fellow Veterans.\"\u00a0 But a\u00a0similar\u00a0survey\u00a0released under Mr. Obama in 2013, found similarly high ratings over the previous decade: \"One signature finding for 2013 is the continuing high degree of loyalty to VA among Veterans,with a score of 93 percent favorable. This score has remained high (above 90 percent) for the past ten years.\" BY:\u00a0Adam Aigner-Treworgy BIDEN STATEMENT: \"Because of what [Trump] did\u00a0 \u2014 even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in the hole.\"\u00a0 CLAIM: Biden says under President Trump, even before the coronavirus pandemic, manufacturing was suffering, \"went into a hole. FACT CHECK: Misleading From the beginning of the Trump administration in January 2017 through February 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the U.S. added about 443,000 manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. DETAILS: As\u00a0Politifact\u00a0noted in July 2020, \"manufacturing employment did increase from mid-2017 to early 2019, but at roughly the same pace as it did for most of Obama's tenure.\" From February 2020 through August 2020, around 720,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost. Politifact also noted in July 2020 that by another measure \u2014 gross manufacturing output by quarter \u2014 there was a rise in output in the first year and a half of Mr. Trump's presidency, but this also was not much faster than under the Obama administration. And hourly earnings for manufacturing workers have also continued to rise under Mr. Trump \"much as they did under Obama.\" BY: Ellis Kim BIDEN CLAIM:\u00a0\"There is a hundred million people that have pre-existing conditions, and they'll be taken away as well, those pre-existing condition \u2014 those insurance companies are going to love this. That's not appropriate to do this before this election.\" FACT CHECK: Mostly true THE DETAILS:\u00a0In 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services released a study which found that 23% to 51% of non-elderly Americans (those under age 65) \u2014 or 61 million to 133 million people \u2014 have pre-existing health conditions. BY: Sara Cook TRUMP STATEMENT:\u00a0\"You (to Biden) don't think we should've closed our country because you thought it was too-- it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months.\" CLAIM:\u00a0Mr. Trump says that he banned travelers from China early on during the pandemic, and that Biden called that ban \"xenophobic\" and \"racist.\"\u00a0FACT CHECK: Inconclusive: Mr. Trump's decision to \"close our country\" wasn't as strict as he claims, and while Biden criticized it, he did not use the terms the president accused him of using.\u00a0\u00a0THE DETAILS:\u00a0Mr. Trump's \"ban\" on travelers from China wasn't a full ban \u2014 it allowed travel from China's Hong Kong and Macao territories. Largely in line with restrictions other countries around the world were implementing at the time, the limitations on travel took effect February 2, after the virus was already widely prevalent in China, according to the Associated Press. \u00a0 After Mr. Trump's restrictions took effect, the New York Times reported that 40,000 Americans and other authorized travelers made the trip from China to the U.S. The AP reported that more than 8,000 Chinese and foreign nationals also entered the country after the restrictions were put in place.\u00a0 While scientists and experts have praised the travel restrictions, there is little evidence to support the claim that it saved the large number of lives Trump has repeatedly stated.\u00a0 As for Mr. Trump's claim about Biden, during an Iowa campaign appearance on the same day the travel restrictions were announced, Biden criticized the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic.\u00a0 \"This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria and xenophobia \u2014 hysterical xenophobia \u2014 and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science,\" Biden said. He did not directly tie this statement to the president's recently announced travel restrictions, and the campaign claims he was not directly referring to the China travel ban. Biden also repeatedly accused the president of xenophobia on Twitter.\u00a0 Eventually, in April 2020, the campaign said Biden supported the ban. \"Science supported this ban, therefore he did too,\" said deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield.\u00a0\u00a0BY: Adam Aigner-Treworgy TRUMP STATEMENT:\u00a0\"We didn't know anything about the disease. Now, we found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren't \u2014 even younger people aren't. We learned a lot.\" CLAIM: \u00a0Young children aren't \"vulnerable\" to COVID.\u00a0FACT CHECK: Misleading\u00a0THE DETAILS:\u00a0While data does show that young children are less likely to contract COVID-19 than adults, it is not true that children have not been affected. It is also not true that children are incapable of spreading the virus.\u00a0Data from the American Academy of Pediatrics reports that as of September 24, children represented only 10.5% of all cases in states reporting cases by age.\u00a0\u00a0The AAP also says \"available data indicated that COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death is uncommon in children\" and that \"it appears that severe illness due to COVID-19 is rare among children.\"However, the AAP also reports that over 624,000 children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic.\u00a0Recent Centers for Disease Control data show that children younger than 10 are capable of transmitting COVID\u00a0 but specifies that teenagers have been twice as likely to contract the virus as elementary school age children.\u00a0Although Mr. Trump regularly asserts that children are largely unaffected by COVID-19, he told journalist Bob Woodward in March that \"plenty of young people\" were affected by the pandemic. It's not clear exactly what age group Trump was referring to, however.\u00a0 Bottom line: The CDC and most experts acknowledge that the effect of COVID on young children is still unclear, and that initial data shows relatively low infection rates, but to say young children \"aren't\" vulnerable to the disease is false.

            "article_content": "Most Americans continue to think the battle against the coronavirus outbreak is going badly, and few would feel comfortable being out in crowded spaces now according to a new\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0released Friday. There's a collective uncertainty about where things are headed next, since just as many think things will get better as get worse, but that nonetheless reflects more optimism than Americans had last week, when their outlook was even more dire. Views on President Trump's handling of the outbreak response have ticked down for the second consecutive week. The president is seen doing a good job by 47%, down four points from 51% last week and 53% the prior week. Now is the first time more say he's doing a bad job than a good one.\u00a0 A second\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0released Friday shows Americans have an increasingly negative view of the economy's financial health, and their prognosis for it is not upbeat: only a third expect this downturn to be temporary. And as often happens, many are interpreting the nation's economic fate through their own experience. Those most concerned about losing work, including those who already have, are the most likely to say the U.S. is headed for a recession, or even depression. But Americans also know the nation's economic health is tied to how it manages the coronavirus. If people think the coronavirus outbreak will get better next month, they're most likely to think the economic downturn will be temporary. For those who fear the outbreak will get worse next month, the economy overwhelmingly looks to them like it's at least headed for recession. *Reporting by Anthony Salvanto, Jen De Pinto, Kabir Khanna & Fred Backus PRESIDENT TRUMP Amid rising\u00a0xenophobia and discrimination\u00a0targeting Asian-Americans following the COVID-19 outbreak, President Trump's re-election campaign is facing backlash from a\u00a0new campaign attack ad\u00a0launched Thursday that describes Joe Biden as \"soft on China.\" Sandwiched between montaged clips of the former vice president praising Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, the attack ad features an image of Asian-American Governor Gary Locke, the former chief executive of Washington State, Commerce Secretary and ambassador to China under the Obama administration.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says the image appears to be taken from a 2013 business leader breakfast in Beijing. \"During America's crisis, Biden protected China's feelings,\" the 30-second spot reads in part. A spokesman for the Biden campaign called the digital ad \"repulsive.\" In a tweet, National Press Secretary TJ Ducklo wrote the Trump campaign \"should apologize to Governor Locke, and take this ad down immediately.\" The Trump campaign deflected criticism on Twitter, saying the image was taken during \"the Hunter Biden trip,\" when Biden was accompanied by his son on an official visit. \"The shot with the flags specifically places Biden in Beijing in 2013. It's for a reason. That's the Hunter Biden trip. Memory Lane for ol' Joe,\" Trump campaign communications director\u00a0Tim Murtagh tweeted. The campaign's response does not address Locke's role, nor the fact that he is an American. Former democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, a Taiwanese-American entrepreneur\u00a0contributing to economic relief\u00a0in the wake of the coronavirus also responded to the video. Calling it \"infuriating,\"\u00a0Yang tweeted, \"Gary Locke is as American as the day is long.\" Down-ballot candidates walk a fine line raising cash during a pandemic As states institute stay-at-home orders advising residents to remain indoors, it's a challenging time to run a campaign. It's a particularly difficult time to ask voters--and even supporters--for cash to help fuel the operation. In three weeks, more than 16 million U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits as efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus shut down businesses across the country. With so many people hurting and unsure what the future holds, candidates are faced with a conundrum.\u00a0 \"How do you ask someone to give money to a campaign right now?\" posed Charleston County Democratic Party chair Colleen Condon. \"I don't know how you do it. I don't know how anybody does it.\" It's a question that candidates and supporting organizations are grappling with all across the United States, report CBS News political unit associate producers  Sarah Ewall-Wice and Eleanor Watson, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell, and CBS News political unit broadcast associate  Aaron Navarro. Many struggle with asking for cash even in the best of times, but experts note, for better or worse, money is still what makes the rest of campaign efforts possible, so it is now about striking a delicate balance.\u00a0 \"On fundraising, it's definitely a huge challenge, especially for down-ballot candidates who don't have as big of a network to work with,\" said Ianthe Metzger, Deputy Director of Campaign Communications for Emily's List which works with progressive women candidates.\u00a0 \"If we do get back to normal in a few months, candidates are going to need the resources to get them over the finish line, so we're not telling them to stop fundraising, just to kind of really talk to people,\"\u00a0 she adds. ELIZABETH WARREN & KAMALA HARRIS Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris on Friday introduced a bill that would federally ban price gouging of consumer goods during national emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says the bill is the Senate companion to one introduced in the House Wednesday that's modeled off a California law against rising the price of certain goods over 10% after a statewide emergency has been declared. The federal bill would allow the FTC to enforce compliance with a ban on any price increases deemed excessive or opportunistic. \"This bill would protect consumers now and during any future crisis by setting tougher rules of the road and enhancing enforcement against predatory price gouging -- and it needs to be included in Congress's next relief package,\" Warren said in a statement.\u00a0 VOTING RIGHTS The November presidential election is more than six months away, but officials from both parties are already sounding the alarm about the need for more resources to ensure health safety and expand alternatives to in-person and day-of voting,\u00a0report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar, Adam Brewster, political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0and\u00a0CBSN political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns. And while some states are taking the lead in expanding vote-by-mail options, a protracted partisan fight over what the general election could and should look like in the age of Coronavirus is underway. There are several challenges, including the need for more resources to build the needed infrastructure, as the clock continues to tick.\u00a0 Polling shows that voters are also thinking ahead about the impact the virus could have on elections. A new Reuters/Ipsos survey found 72% of all U.S. adults support requirements for mail-in ballots as a way to protect voters should the virus continue to spread, including 79% of Democrats and 65% of Republicans. Four states already conduct their general elections by mail, and Hawaii is set to become the fifth state to join this year. Another 28 states and Washington D.C. offer \"no-excuse\" absentee or mail voting but now Democrats are pushing for it to be implemented nationwide.\u00a0 The newly-passed stimulus package allocated $400 million to help secure elections, but Democratic leaders in Congress are pushing for additional funds. The Brennan Center estimates that ensuring a vote-by-mail option in all states would cost at least $1.4 billion, which would include ballot printing, postage costs, dropbox security, ballot tracking and processing, staffing, and additional technology. The center also estimates another $270 million would be necessary to ensure the safety of in-person voting and expand early voting. For Republicans at the national level, Mr. Trump is leading the charge against expanded vote by mail. \"People cheat,\" Mr. Trump said at his daily briefing on Tuesday, though he, too, voted absentee by mail in Florida's primary last month. \"The mail ballots are corrupt in my opinion. They collect them, go out and get people to sign them, forgeries in many cases.\" Mr. Trump argued that his Florida vote last month was different because he was out of the state on Election Day. There are several challenges to expanding vote-by-mail. For starters, the current timeline is tight. States that already have a system have had one in place for a long period of time. For example, it took Washington several years to put the proper infrastructure in place across the state for vote-by-mail elections. And even states that already have a robust absentee voting system say it will be difficult to scale up in time for November's election. One difficulty in scaling up involves the fundamental process of printing and mailing ballots. While a nationalized vote-by-mail system isn't likely to be implemented anytime soon, experts say it is more likely that states move to expand options to augment in-person voting. FOLLOWING ORDERS \"It's the biggest decision I'll ever make,\" Mr. Trump said Friday about potentially \"reopening\" the country's economy by May 1. It's a decision that ultimately starts with the governors in at least 43 states that have issued statewide lockdowns and closed all non-essential businesses, which Mr. Trump alluded to. \"I have great authority if I wanted to use it, I would rather have the states use it,\" he said at his Friday press conference. CBS News legal analyst Jonathan Turley previously told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that \"if a governor has imposed a shelter-in-place order, the president does not have authority to override that order.\" Turley doubled down on that analysis on Friday,\u00a0tweeting\u00a0\"There is a continuing false narrative that Trump can \"open\" the country by some type of presidential edict. He can't. What the President can do is advise governors that they can loosen restrictions, particularly in early areas of receded or low rates of virus. \u00a0That is no small degree of influence but it is a matter of persuasive rather than command authority.\" While several states in the central United States have yet to issue \"stay-at-home\" orders, both Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said those states have still put in effort to prevent any spikes such as contact tracing. \"I really want to salute the governors of states... particularly in the central part of the country. If we pull out of this we're going to pull out of it in the big cities, and we're going to pull out of it in those areas that aren't as densely populated,\" Fauci said. Fauci added that he's had calls with the Governors in Arkansas and Wyoming earlier in the day.\u00a0 Still, Fauci cautioned against a full out \"reopening\" and said \"this is not the time to feel that since we have made such important advance in the sense of success of the mitigation that we need to pull back at all.\" But Mr. Trump said he will name a \"Reopening Our Country\" council onTuesday, and that he would put Democrat and Republican Governors on the council. \"I've asked a couple of them, so far they've all said yes. I think everyone would like to be on that council, it's a very important council,\" he said. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click\u00a0here\u00a0to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington and this week on FACE THE NATION, following chaos at the caucuses in Iowa, will the Democratic Party be able to pull it together for New Hampshire and beyond? And after impeachment, relations between Republicans and Democrats hit new lows, and a vindictive President Trump strikes back against people he sees as enemies. Last week it was the Democrats' turn to deal with disaster as Monday's Iowa caucuses gave Republicans reason to rejoice. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The votes are fried. They have no idea who won. They have no idea. MARGARET BRENNAN: He's right about that as the 2020 Democratic PAC left Iowa behind hoping for a brighter result from New Hampshire. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Bernie Sanders appear to have tied in Iowa, and they're now battling for the top spot in the Granite State. We have brand new Battleground Tracker numbers this morning, and we'll talk to both of them. Plus, with impeachment dismissed, an emboldened President Trump took aim at his enemies. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bull--(EXPLETIVE DELETED). MARGARET BRENNAN: And launched a stunning attack on both Republican Senator Mitt Romney, who voted to remove him from office, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had a shocking moment of her own when she tore up the President's State of the Union Speech. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong. Nor do I like people who say, \"I pray for you\" when they know that that's not so. MARGARET BRENNAN: Then, in apparent retaliation for providing damaging testimony in the impeachment hearings, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman was removed from his National Security Council role and EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland was recalled from his post. We'll talk to Lindsey Graham who warned Democrats last week about the fallout from impeachment. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What you have done is unleash the partisan forces of hell. MARGARET BRENNAN: Plus, the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, weighs in on the spread of the coronavirus in an interview you'll see only on FACE THE NATION. All that and more, is just ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We are still not really sure exactly who won Iowa, but CBS News has so far awarded Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg an equal number of delegates. With just two days from the New Hampshire primary, our CBS News Battleground Tracker shows the two are at the top in New Hampshire, too. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who won the New Hampshire primary four years ago, is at the very top with twenty-nine percent. Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg is running behind him. He's at twenty-five percent. We'll have the full results of our poll later on in the broadcast but we begin with those two top candidates. Senator Bernie Sanders is up first and he joins us from Manchester. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont/@BernieSanders/Democratic Presidential Candidate): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you plan to keep that edge and win on Tuesday? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We are running all over the state. We are talking to as many people as we can. We're talking about what our agenda is, which is an agenda that speaks for the working families of this country, an agenda that is prepared to take on the powerful special interest that have so much influence over the economic and political life of our country. And by the way, we're going to contrast our views with Mayor Buttigieg. And one of the areas of contrast, to be honest with you, is that last count he has about forty billionaires who are contributing to his campaign, the heads of-- the CEOs of the large pharmaceutical industries, of the insurance companies and so forth. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why does that matter? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, on the other hand-- oh, it matters enormously. That is precisely the problem with American politics. When you have the heads of large pharmaceutical companies contributing to your campaign, you are not going to aggressively deal with the fact that in some cases we pay ten times more for the same exact drugs as our friends in Canada or in Europe pay. You're not going to take on the collusion and the corruption of the drug companies who are ripping us off every single day. One out of five Americans cannot even afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: So do you really think that when somebody gets contributions from the CEOs of drug companies, they're going to stand up to the greed and corruption of that industry? I don't think so. MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: But it's not only the pharmaceutical industry--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were standing on that-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: But it's other industries as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were standing on that debate stage on Friday, you said that Democrats would come together and support a nominee. Are you saying-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes. Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --Bernie Sanders will support Pete Buttigieg if he ends up being the nominee-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: No, I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --or even Mike Bloomberg-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Absolute-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --a billionaire himself? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I-- no. I did not say that at all. I think all of them will be far preferable to Donald Trump, who is the most dangerous and corrupt President in the modern history of this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We have got to defeat Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry to be clear-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And what I have-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --you would support either of them if they end up being the nominee? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Margaret. Margaret, I have said from the first day of this campaign that it is absolutely imperative that we defeat Donald Trump. Of course, I will support who the Democratic nominee is. But in the Democratic primary process, I will distinguish myself, differentiate myself from the other candidates and one of the areas that we-- that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --I differentiate myself is we have raised more campaign contributions from more Americans averaging all of eighteen dollars and fifty cents than any candidate in the history of this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your campaign reported some inconsistencies in the results out in Iowa, as did two other campaigns. Columnist Peggy Noonan wrote this, \"They can't run a tiny caucus in a tiny state, but they want us to believe they can reinvent American health care?\" How damaging is it that the Democrats couldn't get this right? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: It is damaging. And I-- and it really saddens me because, you know, I went all over the state of Iowa and they are beautiful people, good people who take their responsibility seriously. And the fact that the Iowa Democratic Party, that has received all kinds of money, could not count those votes in a timely matter is really a sad state of affairs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But you're advocating for the empowerment of the U.S. government to take over the entire health care system. This just optically-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: No. Hold it-- hold it, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: --looks like the party-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Margaret-- Margaret-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --can't run its own caucus. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --Margaret. Margaret, that's not a true statement. I am not advocating for the United States government to take over the health care system. What I am advocating for is an expansion of Medicare. Medicare exists. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I want to expand it over a four-year period that'd be-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --which would be administered by the U.S. government-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Precisely. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and your administration, if you win. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Just as Medicare is right now. But it-- but it's not a takeover. People will still go to the same doctor. They will go to the same hospital. We will substantially lower the cost of prescription drugs. Cost per person will go down. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But what-- but I think the-- the nub of the-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: People will be paying less for health care. But it's not a takeover. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the nub of the criticism, though, is that this is a question of competency. And straight out of the gate, how do you reassure the public that the party whose ticket you are-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Okay. MARGARET BRENNAN: --running on can do this and do this successfully in the states ahead? Nevada is already-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --saying when it comes to their caucuses, they are short of volunteers. Our campaign reporter says they are short a thousand caucus chairs and they might have to even hold two caucuses at once. This doesn't look efficient. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, all right, that may well be the case. But let's get back to the United States government. I'm not the chair of the Nevada Democratic Party. MARGARET BRENNAN: You told my colleague Norah O'Donnell recently on CBS that you couldn't put a price tag on your health care plan and your proposals. But I want to ask you for some clarity here because back in July, you told The Washington Post, Medicare for All would cost between thirty to forty trillion dollars over-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --ten years. Do you still trust those numbers-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and those estimates? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Sure. All that I said-- the answer is yes. But all that I said is anybody who tells you what anything is going to cost in health care is-- is not telling you the truth. There is so much, it's so big. If we do nothing, what the Health and Human Services-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's not thirty to forty trillion? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Over a ten-year period. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Sure. I mean the-- the problem is we're already spending about fifty percent of health care dollars already come from the federal government. We've got to add the other fifty percent. But here's the main point that people should appreciate: if we do nothing, according to Health and Human Services, we're going to be spending fifty trillion dollars. We spend twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of Canada or Europe. So, of course, we can provide health care to all people spending less than we are doing now because we're going to end-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --the hundred billion dollars in profiteering that goes to the drug companies, that goes to the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --insurance companies and the hundreds of billions of dollars in administration of thousands of separate plans, enormously complicated and wasteful system. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Sanders, thank you for your time. We now turn to former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. He is at his campaign headquarters in Manchester. Good morning to you. PETE BUTTIGIEG (Former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana/@PeteButtigieg/Democratic Presidential Candidate): Good morning. Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: According to our latest figures, you're about four points behind Senator Bernie Sanders. How do you close the gap and make the argument that moderates should vote for you and not Joe Biden? PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, New Hampshire is a state that likes to think for itself. And we'll be engaging Democrats as well as a lot of undeclared voters and maybe a handful of Republicans who-- who know that they won't agree with me on everything, but are just sick of looking their kids in the eye and trying to defend or explain this presidency. That kind of hard work, we'll be putting in all the way until polls close on Tuesday, and we're confident that it's going to lead to a great night. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you also have to throw a few elbows here back at Bernie Sanders, who basically is calling you a little inauthentic. He's going after some of your financial base saying you've got at least forty billionaires with ties to the pharmaceutical industry, other big money interests. He's basically saying you're bought and paid for. How do you respond to that? PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, I've never hesitated to stand up to industry. We sued the pharmaceutical industry when opioid-- opioid makers ravaged our community and I am campaigning right now for higher taxes for the wealthy and for corporations to finally have to pay their fair share. And my campaign has been built from the grassroots. We have hundreds of thousands of supporters, most of whom went on PeteForAmerica.com and chipped in a few bucks because they share this vision that we have for the future. You know being the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is not an establishment powerhouse. We're here because this message, this vision that I'm offering is connecting with voters of all backgrounds and at a time like this, if somebody is ready to help us put together the campaign that's going to defeat Donald Trump, then I welcome that support. No matter how they voted in the past, no matter if they've got a lot of money or not, I want their help because, let me tell you, Donald Trump and his allies right now are doing everything they can to hold on to power. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. PETE BUTTIGIEG: They just raised twenty-five million bucks in a day. We need to go into that fight with everything that we've got. And I'm not going to define my campaign by whose help we reject or whose support we turn away. This is a moment to bring everybody that we can into common cause just as we have to unify the country after we do win. MARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Biden says you're unelectable, inexperienced, and today said you're unable to unify the black community. He also released a digital ad. Let's listen. WOMAN (Biden for President Campaign Ad): Joe Biden helped save the auto industry, which revitalized the economy of the Midwest and led the passage and implementation of the Recovery Act, saving our economy from a depression. Pete Buttigieg revitalized the sidewalks of downtown South Bend by laying out decorative brick. And both Biden and Buttigieg have made hard decisions. Despite pressure from the NRA Joe Biden passed the assault weapons banned through Congress; then he passed the Violence against Women Act. And even when public pressure mounted against him, former Mayor Pete fired the first African-American police chief of South Bend; and then he forced out the African-American fire chief, too. MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to that? PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, it's a typical political attack that doesn't tell most of the story. He makes no mention of the work that we did, for example, in my administration, appointing the first African-American top lawyer for the city, helping the first citywide executive African-American woman get elected in South Bend, and really minimizing the experience of my city. And I know that a lot of mayors are speaking up today about the idea that what happens in communities doesn't count. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what-- PETE BUTTIGIEG: Maybe my community does look good from-- does look small from the perspective of Washington. But to us, a lot of times it's the infighting in the Washington establishment-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. PETE BUTTIGIEG: -- that looks small and the work that we're doing on the ground in communities that are tired of being treated as a Washington punch line. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, how do you instill confidence in the public that the Democratic Party can run this election with integrity? Given the confusion that just happened in Iowa? PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, the delay was frustrating. I imagine nobody had more cause to be frustrated than I did. But, at the end of the day, this is about voters standing up and talking about and voting for the future that they want. It's voters asking the question: how's my life going to be different depending which President that we get? And for all the-- the-- the party behind the scenes machinery, what matters most at the end of the day is that the American people are going to send a statement. And the majority that we have right now, not just unified around wanting a different and better President than Donald Trump, but even, more importantly, unified around what we're for: having corporations pay their fair share, raising wages, acting on climate change, getting everybody health care, delivering paid family leave, acting on gun violence. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. PETE BUTTIGIEG: These are America's priorities. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Tom Perez who is-- PETE BUTTIGIEG: They're our priority in our party-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --head of the DNC-- PETE BUTTIGIEG: --and certainly the priority on my campaign. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tom Perez, who's head of the DNC, is saying that perhaps the National Party should be taking more of a role here. That's not instilling a lot of confidence about these local officials. What do you think? PETE BUTTIGIEG: I'll-- I'll let the party work on what the party does. I am focused on what we need to do with the powers of the American presidency to change the trajectory of this country before it is too late. And I believe that there is a strong enough majority for what we seek to do, that there will be an unambiguous, decisive result, not just to end the Trump presidency, but to put Trump-ism itself in the history books if, and only if, we have a platform and a-- and a campaign based on unity and belonging. It's why I'm concerned about a message that says that either you're for a revolution or you must be for the status quo. Most Americans don't know where they fit in that story. I am offering a different approach and that's clearly serving us well. And we're going to be on the ground connecting with as many New Hampshire voters as possible in these remaining hours to make that case and earn that win. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We'll be watching. Thank you, Mayor Pete. And we will be back in one minute with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham. Senator, good morning to you. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina/@LindseyGrahamSC/Judiciary Committee Chairman): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: The President's up. He's watching, apparently, because he sent out a tweet this morning about you appearing on this program. He said, \"DeFace the nation will tell Lindsey Graham they must start up the Judiciary and not stop.\" I'm not exactly sure quite what that means, but it sounds like he's giving you marching orders. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think what he's talking about is oversight of the FISA warrant system that failed. I can promise the President and your viewers that I'm going to call witnesses about-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Foreign surveillance warrants--the Horowitz report. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. The Horowitz report. You know, McCabe, Comey, Rosenstein, Yates. How did you miss it so badly? How could you issue four warrants against an American citizen based on information that was unreliable? But here's what I want to tell the President. I'm not going to be the Republican Christopher Steele. So, Rudy Giuliani last night said he's got the goods on Hunter Biden. I called the attorney general this morning and Richard Burr, the chairman of the Intel Committee, and they told me take very cautiously anything coming out of the Ukraine against anybody. So what I will do is I will get to the bottom of how the FISA warrant system failed and make sure we reform it, doesn't happen again. I think questions about the conflict of interest regarding Hunter Biden in the Ukraine need to be asked. The State Department had warnings and they ignored the conflict of interest. The whistleblower episode needs to be investigated by Richard Burr. But if Rudy Giuliani has any information coming out of the Ukraine, he needs to turn over the Department of Justice because it could be Russian propaganda. MARGARET BRENNAN: You last time you're on this program, though, in December, you said Giuliani should come to the Judiciary Committee with what he said was a suitcase full of documents he picked up in Ukraine-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --on the Bidens. Are you saying you don't want any part of this anymore? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: After talking to the attorney general and the intelligence chairman that any documents coming out of the Ukraine against any American, Republican or Democrat, need to be looked at by the intelligence services, who has expertise I don't because Russia is playing us all like a fiddle. And Christopher Steele was played by the Russians that started the Russian investigation against President Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: It was all garbage. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you saying Rudy Giuliani-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And I don't want to do the same thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: --Rudy Giuliani is getting played by the Russians? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't know. I am saying that the attorney-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it sounds like that's what you're suggesting. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'm saying that anybody who's got any information coming from the Ukraine needs to turn it over to the intelligence community. As to Senator Schumer warning Parnas in the audience, if you don't understand-- MARGARET BRENNAN: This is one of Rudy Giuliani's business associates. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, crooked as snake-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --who's been indicted. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --facing indictment. So Schiff gets called by Russian hoaxster. I've got photos of President Trump in a compromised situation. To every American politician, you should be very cautious about receiving information coming out of the Ukraine-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --and other countries that may be backed by Russian misinformation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the President know that? Because he-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I hope so. MARGARET BRENNAN: --apparently, has continued to-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, if he's watching the show, here's what I would tell the President. MARGARET BRENNAN: --believe that Ukraine had a role here. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'm going to get to the bottom of the FISA work process because it was an abuse of power of the Department of Justice, the FBI. And we're gonna make sure that Hunter Biden's conflict of interest is explored because it's legitimate. How could Joe Biden really fight corruption when his son sitting on the Burisma board? MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you clarify? You said you talked to Attorney General Barr-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: This morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: --this morning. Has the Department of Justice been ordered to investigate the Bidens? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No. The Department of Justice is receiving information coming out of the Ukraine from Rudy-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Already? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --to see. He told me that they've created a process that Rudy could give information and they would see if it's verified. Rudy Giuliani is a well-known man. He's a crime fighter. He's loyal to the President. He's a good lawyer. But what I'm trying to say-- to the President and anybody else, that the Russians are still up to it. Deterrence is not working. So, let's look at Hunter Biden's conflict. Let's look at Joe Biden. Vice President Biden, what did you do when they told you your son was on Burisma's board? It undercuts your ability to fight corruption. Did you take it seriously? Obviously he didn't. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: But when it comes to documents coming out of the Ukraine, to Republicans and Democrats, be very cautious turning-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But the-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --anything over you got over to the intel community. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you ever said to the President when he repeats things like the idea that there's the DNC server-- server hidden in Ukraine, that this is Russian propaganda that he is repeating and, apparently, believing? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I'll-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you ever said that directly to him? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I don't have any information about the server being in the Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you just said-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And it was the Russians-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --things coming out of Ukraine should be looked at with high scrutiny-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Here's my point-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --because of Russian interference. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --my point. It was the Russians who hacked into the DNC, not the Ukrainians. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: But there are people in the Ukraine that were pulling against Trump because they hated Manafort. To suggest there was no political interference coming out of the Ukraine directed toward the President, I think would be-- would not withstand scrutiny. MARGARET BRENNAN: When-- you have a role as chairman of Senate Judiciary to have oversight-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --of Justice Department. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'm not in charge of the whole government. MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- I understand that. However, when you're talking about being asked to do these things and a channel being open between Rudy Giuliani and the Justice Department, this sounds a lot like this is in some ways a taxpayer-funded oppo-research operation against Joe Biden. Isn't this exactly what was at the heart of the impeachment probe to begin with? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No, not at all. There are plenty of people being contacted by folks from the Ukraine. Adam Schiff got contacted by somebody thought to be a Russian and he was willing to get on a plane, apparently, and go find the documents. Schumer believes that Parnas has got the goods. Parnas says, \"I'm in on it. I've never met Parnas. So Democrats are being played and I'm not going to be played.\" So we're going to look at the Hunter Biden, Joe Biden connection to the Ukraine. We're going to ask the State Department, why didn't you do something about the conflict of interest. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: When the-- John Kerry's chief of staff was warned about Hunter Biden's conflict on Burisma-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --what did you do, if anything? That's all legitimate. Rudy says he's got the goods. All I can tell Rudy and anybody else, if you got some information connected to the Ukraine against anybody, go to the Intel Committee not me. MARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you don't want a part of it right now. We need to finish this conversation-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Okay. MARGARET BRENNAN: --because you brought up a number of things. So we're going to have to take a quick break. I do want to-- to-- to say, though, that to this point, nothing has been in any way substantiated in regard to corruption when it comes to Joe Biden himself. His son served on the board and was paid for it. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I just think the media is so in the tank over this issue-- MARGARET BRENNAN: No but-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --it makes me sick to my stomach.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You just said-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We'll talk about it in a minute. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But you were saying it needs to be investigated-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, nobody's investigating it. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're acknowledging there's no proof of it-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: CBS hasn't sent-- sent one reporter. MARGARET BRENNAN: To Ukraine? Yes, we did. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. I don't think you take it seriously. MARGARET BRENNAN: We are, so we're taking a break and I'm coming back to talk to you about it-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good. MARGARET BRENNAN: --on the other side of it. So stay with us all of you. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham is going to stay with us. We'll continue in a few moments. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Over the weekend in Wuhan, China, the first American died from the coronavirus, and here in the U.S. the number of confirmed cases is now at twelve. In our next half hour, we'll talk with the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. about the epidemic. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but stay with us because we will be right back in our second half hour with more from Senator Lindsey Graham and analysis of the week from our political panel. We'll be back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation now with South Carolina Republican Senator, Lindsey Graham. Senator, we were talking about the President's tweet this morning, the requests that have been made of you in terms of continuing investigations. This morning on Fox, Rudy Giuliani is continuing to say, quote, you are telling him, \"Not my job. Not my job, man\" when it comes to information he says he's handing over. You were just saying that any information coming out of Ukraine needs to be dealt with carefully and skeptically because it's likely the product of some kind of-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: It-- it-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Russian intelligence operation. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Have we learned anything from Christopher Steele dossier? It was all a bunch of garbage fed to Christopher Steele to go after Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's what you think Rudy Giuliani-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And I'm telling Schumer-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --is delivering garbage? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't know. I'm telling Schumer, don't vouch for Parnas. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Don't put him in the gallery. I'm telling Rudy, you think you got the goods? Don't give it to me, because what do we know? We know that the Russian disinformation campaign was used against President Trump. They hacked into the DNC system. Not the Ukrainians-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --and they're on the ground all over the world trying to affect democracy all over the world. MARGARET BRENNAN: Who's paying Rudy Giuliani? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't know. Here's my message to Rudy: If you've got something coming from the Ukraine, turn it over to the intelligence people, the Department of Justice, to any Democrat. MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You think Parnas has got something on me? Well, then go to the Department of Justice and the Intel Committee. Do not pass this stuff on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I want to ask you as well because you have served in the U.S. Air Force. You are a military lawyer, a JAG. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you support President Trump's decision to dismiss Alex Vindman, the lieutenant colonel who was serving on the National Security Council, who was compelled by a subpoena to go under oath and testify against the President? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think his reassignment was justified. I don't think he could be effective at the NSC. As much as I support our military people telling the truth when asked, it's important they do, what have I learned in the last two years? CIA agents, Department of State, Department of Justice lawyers, FBI agents have a political agenda and they acted on it. And we found that out through the FISA investigation. As to Colonel Vindman, he was not allowed to be asked questions about his connection to the alleged whistleblower, to people working on Schiff's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: He was asked, and he denied having any-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No, he was not. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: They did not allow him-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --he was asked during the testimony. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: They did not allow the Republicans go down that road. Two things-- MARGARET BRENNAN: His brother was also marched out of the White House-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: All I can say is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: His brother also serves in military-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and had no connection-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He has no-- he has no right-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --to this impeachment. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Nobody knows this. I can promise you this. He's never been asked questions did you leak to the whistleblower? People in his chain of command have been suspicious of him regarding his political point of view. MARGARET BRENNAN: The national security adviser to the President sat in the chair you're sitting in last week and said he was confident that there were no leaks from the National Security Council. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I am not. I want the man to be asked about what he did with the information. I appreciate his service, but there are FBI agents who took the law in their own hands. There are CIA agents who took the law in their own hands. There are Department of Justice lawyers who lied to the court. There has been a movement since President Trump was elected by people in our government-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this retaliation-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --to take him down. MARGARET BRENNAN: --because the President has tweeted, basically saying that Vindman was forced out, not because of-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --any kind of policy issue, not because of anything else except for-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, Margaret, we're going to get-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --what he said was listening in on his phone calls and giving horrendous report. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We're not going to be intimidated in-- against asking-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But doesn't this-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --questions to the whistleblower. MARGARET BRENNAN: Somebody-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Who is the whistleblower? MARGARET BRENNAN: He is an officer, and he is not allowed to speak out on his own behalf. Neither are his fellow military officers allowed to do so. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He was shut down. I don't know what role he played with the whistleblower, if any, but we're going to look. I like Joe Biden. He's a fine man, but we're not going to give you a pass because you're-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Should Gordon Sondland have been fired as well? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He is a political appointee. He serves at the pleasure of the President. He came before the country-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --in under oath-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --but it was retaliation. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --gave-- gave-- gave the story as-- as he said it. We're not going to live in a world where the Department of Justice, the CIA and the FBI can cut corners, go after Trump, and nobody gives a damn. As to Colonel Vindman, thank you for your service. But I'm going to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --hopefully, somebody will ask questions of you about the role you play with the whistleblower, if any. And if there's nothing there, fine. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Graham, thank you-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: --for joining us this morning. When we come back, a rare interview with the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. We'll ask him about the coronavirus. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look at efforts to contain the now over thirty-seven thousand confirmed cases of coronavirus in China, where the death toll stands at at least eight hundred and eleven. Joining us to talk more about the virus is China's ambassador to the U.S. Welcome to FACE THE NATION, Ambassador Cui. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI (Chinese Ambassador to the U.S./@AmbCuiTiankai): Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Our condolences for these-- AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: Thank you very much. MARGARET BRENNAN: --hundreds of fatalities. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why hasn't the virus been contained? AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: Well, you see this is a new virus. So, virtually, very few people knew anything about it at the beginning. That's how people are still learning to discover more about the virus and how it affects people and the channels of infections and trying their best to stop it. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. has offered repeatedly-- AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --to send CDC experts, American experts, to help out. Why does Beijing continue to ignore those offers? AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: I don't think it's been ignored. First of all-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you haven't said yes. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: Well, we-- we welcome the American expert to participate in our efforts. And we are coordinating with the World Health Organization because a lot of things are done under the auspices of the World Health Organization. We certainly welcome American experts to join the actual group that the WHO, the assembly. And I'm sure they will be going to China very soon. MARGARET BRENNAN: You expect Americans to be there as part of the WHO but you don't want the CDC there? AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: There-- there-- first of all, American experts are on the list recommended by the WHO. We certainly respect-- I think all of us respect the WHO as the most professional intergovernmental body in the world. And for the U.S. CDC, they have very frequent regular contact with the-- their Chinese counterparts, the Chinese CDC. And even beyond that, some American experts have come to China already on their own individual basis. So there is ongoing contacts not only between the two governments, but also between the two CDCs and between the academic institutions and even some American companies are also offering help, technical help. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I-- I asked the question because it also gets at there's a lot of unknown and a lot of suspicion because of that. And, in fact, this week, Senator Tom Cotton--who sits on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee--suggested that the virus may have come from China's biological warfare program. That's an extraordinary charge. How do you respond to that? AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: I think it's true that a lot is still unknown and our scientists, Chinese scientists, American scientists, scientists of other countries are doing their best to learn more about the virus, but it's very harmful. It's very dangerous to stir up suspicion, rumors, and spread them among the people. For one thing, this will create panic. Another thing that it will fend up racial discrimination, xenophobia, all these things, that will really harm our joint efforts to combat the virus. Of course, there are all kinds of speculation and rumors. There are people who are saying that these virus are coming from some military lab, not of China, maybe in the United States. How-- how can we believe all these crazy things? MARGARET BRENNAN: You think it's crazy. Where did the virus come from? AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: Absolutely crazy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Where did the virus come from? AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: We still don't know yet. It's probably-- according to some initial outcome of the research, probably coming from some animals. But we have to-- to discover more about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: There has been some outcry on social media, particularly after the death of Doctor Li Wenliang. He had made public warnings for weeks before the government acknowledged this was happening. In fact, authorities had forced him to disavow what he had said previously, which turned out to be true. The Communist Party of China is now investigating this. Why? AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: Well, we are all very saddened about the death of Doctor Li. He is a good doctor. He was a devoted doctor, and he did his best to protect people's health. We are so grateful to him. But you see, he was a doctor and a doctor could be alarmed by some individual cases. But as for the government, you have to do more. You have to base your decisions, your announcement on more solid evidence and signs. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think silencing him in the beginning was a mistake? AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: I-- I don't know who tried to silence him, but there was certainly a disagreement or people were not able to reach agreement on what exactly the virus is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: --how it is affecting people. So there was a process of trying to discover more, to learn more about the virus. Maybe some people reacted not quickly enough. Maybe Doctor Li, he perceived some incoming dangers-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: --earlier than others, but this is-- this could happen anywhere. But whenever we find there's some shortcoming-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: --we'll do our best to correct it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have Chinese authorities detained the citizen journalist, Chen Qiushi? He has disappeared and his videos revealed a lot of what was happening with this virus. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: I'm sorry. I have not-- never heard of this guy, so I don't have any information to share with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: His videos are how the rest of the world has seen some of the images of what's happening. I want to also ask you quickly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave an extraordinary speech yesterday to a-- a number of governors from all around the United States. And he harshly criticized the Chinese Communist Party and he said that your country is targeting states, cities, schools, academic institutions to try to figure out how to exploit them. What exactly is the intention of the Chinese government? Because the secretary of state says it's not good. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: I always believe the real foundation of China-U.S. relations is the friendship and mutual understanding between our peoples. So this is the root of state to state relations. And there's such an infusion among American states, cities and towns and ordinary Americans to learn more about China, to develop friendship with Chinese people-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: --to facilitate cooperation between our two countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he's-- he's-- AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: I don't-- I don't think anybody has any reason to against the will of the people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he specifically referenced concentration camps in Xinjiang. He talked about American institutions and inadvertently investing in surveillance of Muslim minorities. Do you want to respond to that point? AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: That's totally wrong. That's totally wrong because the core issue in Xinjiang is how to combat terrorism. You see, some years ago until most recently, people in Xinjiang were victims-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: --to rising terrorist-- terrorist attacks. There were thousands of such attacks hurting and even killing hundreds of thousands of people. So, we have to do something to stop this threat-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: --to the very well-being and the lives of the people there. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: So without tremendous efforts now, for the last three years-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. AMBASSADOR CUI TIANKAI: --there has been no such terrorist attack. So people have a much better safety there, security there and people are happy there. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Ambassador, thank you for telling your side of the story. We will be right back with new numbers from our CBS News Battleground Tracker. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to some political analysis from our panel, Jeffrey Goldberg is the editor-in-chief in The Atlantic. Leslie Sanchez is a CBS News political contributor. Jamal Simmons is the host on Hill.TV and also CBS News political contributor, and Jerry Seib is the executive Washington editor at the Wall Street Journal. It is great to have you all here. I want to get to the new poll numbers. But first, I think we need to digest some of what we just heard. We had two pretty substantial interviews. Jeffrey, the Chinese ambassador at the tail end of our interview said people in Xinjiang, China, are very happy. To be clear, the U.S. government says there are between one and three million Muslim minorities in camps. The Pentagon has called them concentration camps. JEFFREY GOLDBERG (The Atlantic/@JeffreyGoldberg): Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: How do we knowing that kind of denial-- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --of what is established fact, how do we understand everything he told us? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Well, what you have to understand is that the Chinese government is lying about the nature of what's happening in these camps. When you take between one and three million people of a particular ethnic group against their will and concentrate them in prison camps for reeducation, it seems like a fair thing to say that that's a concentration camp. The Chinese ambassador is arguing that the people are happy. I would simply suggest that you should let the international media in to these camps and we'll go ask them ourselves. MARGARET BRENNAN: I will take them up on that invitation if that ever I mean\u2026 JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yeah. I mean, you know-- yeah, road to-- on a panel road trip. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yeah. Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: There we go. It is-- I just-- I wanted to make sure we didn't leave that there. Jerry, I want to pick up with you on some of what we heard from Senator Graham, as well. The President sent that tweet right as the show went on the air. It was directly aimed at one of our guests, who he knew-- GERALD SEIB (Wall Street Journal/@GeraldFSeib): Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --was going to be appearing. What did you make of what Lindsey Graham said he was willing to do and what the President seemed to be asking him to do? GERALD SEIB: Well, I think, first of all, we're at kind of an awkward transition point here, which we're moving beyond impeachment and beyond the Mueller report potentially, but the President doesn't really want to. He wants some retribution. You saw that over the weekend with the firing of witnesses. And he wants to know who's the whistleblower, and he wants the Bidens investigated. And I think Lindsey Graham was saying, hold on, let's not go down that path. Don't turn me into the Republican Party's Christopher Steele, as he said here. And so I think you have the emergence of some tension within the Trump coalition about whether we really want to continue going down this path or that maybe it's time to declare victory and move on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Leslie, I mean, doesn't that get back at the heart of what this impeachment inquiry was about, which was this question of things being aimed with taxpayer dollars at actually being part of a political opposition research arm rather than what they are officially called? LESLIE SANCHEZ (CBS News Political Contributor/@LeslieSanchez): Well, that's particularly the case with FISA, right? And the President has strong grounds to stand on when he was saying that there was an extension beyond what it should have been. But, particularly, I think you have to look at it from a political lens. The President knows that there is a lot of-- he-- and he called it witch hunts, he called it corruption, that he wants illuminated. He wants more transparency and he's really relying on the Senate to do that. The independents-- I know we-- we talk about this. Politically, it works. Politically, it's part of an effort that galvanizes and really it-- it's building a cohesive bases behind the President wanting to illuminate these issues. JAMAL SIMMONS (Hill.TV/@JamalSimmons/CBS News Political Contributor): It's amazing to me that they want to illuminate issues in the United States Senate, when they refused to call witnesses in the midst of an impeachment trial when we were having real-time information coming out in the press, for people to find out about what the President was up to. At the same time, we're saying the President now began to punish witnesses who came forward, fire people from their jobs, move them out of the way. I think-- we're now-- we're now seeing Donald Trump unleashed, and it is as frightening as people thought it might be. MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe these investigations or calls for them will continue as long as Joe Biden stays in this presidential race? JAMAL SIMMONS: Well, I'm sure. And I'm sure he'll move on to someone else. It may not be the Ukrainians where they'll find somewhere else to go after Pete Buttigieg or Michael Bloomberg or whoever becomes the Democratic frontrunner. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: The-- the pattern in Washington is to move on, but Donald Trump doesn't move on. And that's what we're going to see in the next few months. MARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Biden, we'll see how he fares on Tuesday, but he didn't really have a very good week, at least kind of a rocky start, certainly out in Iowa. You know, he-- he was thought to be at least in the top three. I-- I want-- was a distant fourth. In our most recent Battleground Tracker numbers, I want to tell you, the current rankings, Bernie Sanders, as we mentioned, top spot twenty-nine percent; Pete Buttigieg, twenty-five percent; third, Elizabeth Warren at seventeen percent; then Biden, twelve percent; then Amy Klobuchar, ten percent; and this survey in the field before the debates. So we'll see these numbers are fluid up in New Hampshire, where the poll was conducted. Well what do we make of this? I mean Joe Biden still in-- in the fourth spot here, Jamal? JAMAL SIMMONS: He is. And I got to tell you, when I take a look at this and I see Joe Biden in fourth place in Iowa, I see him perhaps coming in at fourth place in New Hampshire. I'm not sure what happens in Nevada, but there's this sense that he's going to hold on to South Carolina. And that just defies all political logic. Each one of these things is building on each other. I think that voters he's counting on, those older African-American voters in South Carolina are paying attention to what's happening in these early states. And if he looks like-- they're-- they're with him, because they think he's a winner, and if he's not winning, I'm not sure how they hold on to that. The other thing that we know here is that Elizabeth Warren seems to overperforming her poll numbers, but with an organizing. So that means she's probably in third place, maybe she comes up a little bit better. And Bernie Sanders, though, is probably going to win another one of these states, which means that Democrats in DC and around the country are going to be really wrestling with what to do next. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Leslie, is that the Republican sort of best wish, best hope to have Bernie Sanders be the nominee? LESLIE SANCHEZ: Absolutely, because the contrast will be very stark. And I want to go back to this impeachment issue, Jamal, with all-- with all due respect on that issue. The one thing that it did do from a political standpoint is it accelerated the campaign, not only in organizing the President's message, which has proven to be very particularly effective, but has also increased the negatives on the Hunter Biden issue that you're seeing, kind of the-- the down-- the effect-- real politique with Joe Biden. And I don't know if he's going to be able to survive that. It's been very impactful. But money, they raised a hundred and seventeen million dollars, meaning the Trump campaign and the apparatus, just within the time of impeachment. So while the party is very organized around this message and around, you know, the contrast to that, the Democrats are-- are, obviously, very fractured and, you know, it can speak more about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeffrey, the President, essentially, launched his own reelection on the floor of the state-- giving the State of the Union Address this week. Prior to that, he had the big Super Bowl ad. He seems to be making-- I want you to weigh in on this, too, Jamal-- he seems to be making a push at trying to build support among minorities in particular. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: He thinks that he-- that's winnable for him. He's really focused on that in his ads and he was focused on it in his language at State-- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --of the Union. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. He was not only launching his reelection campaign, it seems like he was also launching a new reality TV show at the same time. It was amazing thing to watch, given-- for people who've watched State of the Unions in the past. Yes. There's-- there's a very concerted effort to work on African-American votes. That's through the-- through various prison reform, judicial reform issues. You know he doesn't do terribly poorly with Latino males in some-- in some parts of the country. You know, we've all said this in a million different ways. Takeaway Twitter from Donald Trump, takeaway some of the-- the extra meanness, and-- and focus the message, he could reach certain minority communities, people of color in-- in-- in ways that he is not. And I am wondering if he has the discipline to keep this pivot going or the next time someone, a person of color annoys him he goes out of his way to attack them and remind people what his record is on questions of race. But there's definitely an effort. JAMAL SIMMONS: I'm going to send this flag up to the Democratic Party. People need to understand this. We talked to Terrance Woodbury, a young African-American pollster. He has been saying for months that he thinks Trump is going very hard at African-American men, particularly younger African-American men, Kim and Kanye West, ASAP Rocky getting out of Sweden, HBCU Money. He's got a whole list of things the President has been doing. I think they're not going to let up. And he doesn't have to win it. He just have to tick it up a couple of points in some key places to have it count. And Democrats need to have a candidate who really has a strategy about how to deal with that. And if Bernie Sanders is not the nominee, I will tell you, a lot of those-- a lot of Bernie Sanders' voters are anti-establishment voters more than their Democrats. And they might get wooed by Donald Trump. GERALD SEIB: And-- and this also comes at a time when the hottest Democratic presidential candidate happens to be Pete Buttigieg, who has noticeable problems with the African-American community, so maybe there's a kind of harmonic convergence here. But I also wanted to add that the other person who had a great week this week was Michael Bloomberg, right? MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GERALD SEIB: So the scenario that's unfolding right now is got to be exactly the one that Bloomberg had in mind when he got into the race late, a fade by Joe Biden, growing concern within the Democratic Party about nominating somebody as liberal as Bernie Sanders and a really resilient President Trump emerging as a threat to win reelection. That's the Bloomberg formula. And it's all kind of fallen into place this week. So he's sitting on the sideline right now listening to everything we're talking about and saying, well, that was kind of my bargain-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. GERALD SEIB: --when I got in. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thanks to all of you-- JAMAL SIMMONS: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: --for helping us digest it all. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Our apologies to Anthony Salvanto. Our Battleground Tracker segment can be seen on CBSN and our website. Really important numbers, very timely. We thank Anthony for all he does for FACE THE NATION. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "President Trump\u00a0has called mail-in voting \"substantially fraudulent.\" But amid growing concerns about a second wave of the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0in the fall, states are trying to figure out how they will increase access to\u00a0mail-in voting, report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0and\u00a0political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. The pandemic has prompted a total of 17 states to postpone their presidential primaries and expand their mail ballot access, with some states, like Rhode Island, Georgia and Maryland, sending out ballot application forms to registered voters.\u00a0 Five states \u2014 Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington \u2014 already have all-mail elections, which consist of a mix of sending ballots to registered voters and opening up limited polling centers for those that wish to vote in-person. Connecticut and Michigan are sending ballot applications to registered voters, while states that had previously limited who could request a mail ballot, like Massachusetts and New Hampshire, have opened access further for the November elections because of the pandemic.\u00a0 CBS News has counted 40 states and the District of Columbia that have not yet officially made changes to their mail vote for the November general election, though many have adopted it for the primaries and 27 of these states don't have specific requirements to receive a mail ballot.\u00a0 Twitter on Tuesday evening added new \"fact-check\" notices to Mr. Trump's tweets on mail-in voting. The president suggested Tuesday morning that mail-in ballots lead to voter fraud in multiple posts online, though he provided no evidence.\u00a0 \"Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending ballots to millions of people, anyone....living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one,\" the president tweeted, in part.\u00a0 A spokesperson for Twitter confirmed to CBS News this is the first time the company has fact-checked Mr. Trump on the platform, though it has been done for other world leaders. In March, Twitter marked one of the president's retweets as \"manipulated media,\" after Mr. Trump shared an edited video of his political opponent Joe Biden posted by White House deputy chief of communications Dan Scavino. Read more about Trump's comments on mail voting, and what states have adapted for November\u00a0here. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Joe Biden added his support for an investigation into the death of George Floyd, the 46-year-old black man who died while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers on Monday night,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0reports.\u00a0 \"George Floyd's life mattered. It mattered as much as mine, it mattered as much as anyone's in this country \u2014 at least it should have,\" Biden said Wednesday morning during a virtual chat. Floyd's death \"sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat, every single day,\" Biden added, saying that this was not an \"isolated incident but part of an ingrained systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country.\"\u00a0 Biden said the officers seen on camera \"have to be held fully accountable,\" noting the ongoing FBI investigation on whether Floyd's civil rights were violated. \"We have to get to the root of all of this,\" he said.\u00a0 Also on Wednesday, Biden and rumored potential running mate Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth penned an op-ed on hate towards Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. The two alleged President Trump has upped the anger, too. Asian-Americans have been \"yelled at by strangers in parking lots, refused service at stores and needlessly, cruelly scapegoated by the most powerful man on the planet, President Donald Trump, who has racialized the pandemic and stoked xenophobia every time he's uttered the term 'Chinese virus,'\" the two\u00a0wrote.\u00a0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP The Trump campaign launched a new ad Wednesday, touting the president's style of governing amid the coronavirus pandemic, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0 \"President Trump is not always polite. Mr. Nice Guy won't cut it. He does it his way, not the Washington way. But Donald Trump gets it done,\" the video narration reads, in part. The campaign plans to air the 30 second spot nationally, investing \"mid-seven\" figures behind the buy. Mr. Trump threatened to \"strongly regulate\" or shut down social media companies Wednesday, following Twitter's move to fact-check two of the president's tweets about mail-in voting.\u00a0 \"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016,\" the president tweeted, Wednesday morning. \"We can't let a more sophisticated version of that...happen again. Just like we can't let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!\" Trump added.\u00a0 It is unclear under what constitutional authority the president could use to shut down social media companies. VEEPSTAKES KAMALA HARRIS On Wednesday, Senator Kamala Harris addressed the killing of George Floyd calling it a \"public execution.\" \u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\u00a0reports that at a League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) Virtual Town Hall to address the impact COVID-19 has had on the Latino community, Harris was asked about Floyd's murder.\u00a0 \"The discriminatory implementation and enforcement of the laws and the need, therefore, to reform these systems and also hold accountable those who abuse these systems and who engage in the kind of conduct that caused that man to die needlessly at that, at the knee of someone who was using force that was unnecessary and was clearly not only in violation of the civil rights of that community and that man, but was, you know, torture in the way that it was done,\" Harris said. She added, \"The man couldn't breathe. He was begging to be able to breathe. And he was executed. It was a public execution.\"\u00a0 Harris also weighed in on veepstakes speculation when asked by host Jorge Ramos if former Vice President Biden should choose a woman of color as his running mate. \u00a0 \"We need to have a greater push and a greater requirement and a greater support for women of color to hold these positions that invariably will impact women of color and all people,\" she said. \"But elective representation in America should represent the people of America. And right now, it does not.\" ELIZABETH WARREN Two months after Senator Elizabeth Warren first proposed a massive bailout of the child care industry,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says Senate and House Democrats have introduced a bill that would give grant funding to childcare centers across the country.\u00a0 The Child Care is Essential Act, of which Warren is a co-sponsor, would provide $50 billion in grants for childcare centers to keep their staff employed and pay their expenses, as well as to pay tuition and copays for working families and essential workers.\u00a0 \"Without emergency relief funding, our child care system is in danger of collapsing,\" Warren said in a statement. She's written to leadership twice, in March and April, and released a similar plan for a $50 billion child care stimulus with Minnesota Senator Tina Smith in April. Warren is also asking the federal government to help devastated Native American communities as it divvies out pandemic aid. She and House ally New Mexico Representative Deb Haaland on Wednesday requested that the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights investigate the government's response to COVID-19 in tribal nations. Noting that last week the Navajo Nation's president said it had a higher coronavirus infection rate than any U.S. state, Warren and Haaland argued that the Commission should update it's 2018 \"Broken Promises: Continuing Federal Funding Shortfall for Native Americans\" report.\u00a0 \"The Administration's failure to uphold the trust responsibility to provide adequate relief, health services, and public safety resources to tribal communities has exacerbated the pandemic's impact. This failure requires the Commission's voice,\" wrote Warren and Haaland in a letter to the Commission's chair. The request followed an op-ed the lawmakers co-authored in the Washington Post Tuesday evening in which the senators said it took over a month for Native nations to receive any of the funding the CARES Act granted them.\u00a0 \"By disregarding the clear health crisis in tribal communities, the federal government continues a tragic pattern of broken promises to Native nations,\" they wrote. \u00a0 LIFE AFTER 2020 TULSI GABBARD Representative Tulsi Gabbard dropped her defamation lawsuit against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Wednesday, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. The former 2020 presidential contender and Hawaii lawmaker sued Democratic Party's 2016 presidential nominee over comments Clinton made last year that seemed to allege Gabbard is a \"Russian asset.\"\u00a0 The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleged Clinton lied about Gabbard, \"publicly, unambiguously, and with obvious malicious intent\" when she made derogatory comments in October 2019 in an effort to hurt Gabbard's bid for the White House. Gabbard's attorney Dan Terzian filed docments in Manhattan Federal Court this morning, withdrawing the suit.\u00a0 \"Plaintiffs Tulsi Gabbard and Tulsi Now, Inc. dismiss this action,\" attorneys for Gabbard, Dan Terzian and Janice Roven, wrote in a court filing on Wednesday. \"While they remain certain of the action's legal merit, they are just as certain that this new COVID and post-COVID world require them to focus their time and attention on other priorities, including defeating Donald Trump in 2020, rather than righting the wrongs here.\" NEWSMAKERS VALERIE JARRETT Former Vice President Joe Biden should consider selecting a woman of color as his running mate, but that should not be the only criteria, says former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. \"I think it would be a real signal around our country of the progress that we're making similarly to when President Obama was elected,\" Jarrett told\u00a0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion\u00a0in a wide-ranging interview Wednesday.\u00a0 Jarrett added that she thought former presidential candidate and California Senator Kamala Harris would be \"a terrific vice president\" but she stated Biden's options should not be limited and said it's important that he selects someone who is compatible.\u00a0 \"I'm confident, knowing him as I do, that he will pick the right running mate,\" Jarrett said. She also weighed in on the fracas over the former vice president's recent Breakfast Club interview. Biden told host Charlamagne tha God: \"I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.\" Biden later called the remarks \"cavalier.\" Jarrett, who called it an \"off-the-cuff remark\" pointed out that \"he apologized right away.\" She added, \"I think it's important that candidates be judged by their record.\" Jarrett also joined Biden and a growing number of political figures in condemning the death of George Floyd, an African-American man who was killed after being pinned down in an encounter with Minneapolis police. \"We have to figure out what can we do so that these young men and boys of color are not considered a threat when they're simply doing what everyone else is doing, walking down the street innocently,\" Jarrett said. RINGING ENDORSEMENTS FOREVER YOUNG The progressive nonprofit NextGen America, which works to mobilize young people, announced Wednesday it was endorsing Joe Biden for President. With an initial investment of $45 million,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0reports the group will be targeting more than 4.5 million young people ages 18 to 35 with the help of more than 150 full-time organizing staff in 11 battleground states.\u00a0 At the same time, NextGen America also announced an initial $11 million in digital ads contrasting Biden and President Trump starting in June. Those ads will appear in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Of the first two ads the group released featuring Biden, both focus on free public college education, expanding affordable health care, and a plan to tackle climate change.\u00a0 \"This election is about young Americans and our future, and the choice for us is clear: Joe Biden is the best candidate for president,\" said NextGen America Executive Director Ben Wessel in a statement. The endorsement and mobilization effort comes after Biden struggled to gain support among young people during the primary season. On Tuesday, Biden's campaign announced its own program to mobilize young people called League 46. STATE-BY-STATE FLORIDA SpaceX and NASA scrubbed their scheduled launch Wednesday, as thunderstorms along Florida's coast thwarted a mission that would've taken American astronauts into orbit from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. The next attempted launch is slated three days from now \u2013 Saturday, May 30, at 3:22 p.m. ET.\u00a0 Until then, astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are expected to head back to quarantine, according to\u00a0CBS\u00a0News\u00a0campaign\u00a0reporters\u00a0LaCrai\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0and\u00a0Nicole Sganga. President Trump and Vice President Pence were expected to witness the historic commercial crew launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Thursday afternoon. For the first time since the Space Shuttle Program ended in July 2011, American astronauts were anticipated to skyrocket to the International Space Center (ISS) aboard the Crew Dragon spacecraft.\u00a0 According to NASA, the demonstration mission, which is part of the Commercial Crew Program, would have been the first time NASA astronauts tested the spacecraft systems in orbit. The postponed flight will serve as SpaceX's final flight test, \"paving the way for NASA to certify the crew transportation system for regular, crewed flights\" to ISS.\u00a0 The Biden campaign held a press call with former NASA Administrator and Astronaut Charles Bolden and former Florida Senator Bill Nelson Wednesday to discuss in part how the mission came to be. Both Bolden and Nelson praised former Vice President Joe Biden for the role he played in helping serve as an intermediary and advocate for the space program during the Obama administration.\u00a0 When asked whether the attendance of President Trump and Vice President Pence would be an indication of their support for the effort, both Nelson and Bolden agreed any administration's support is helpful in the advancement of the program.\u00a0 \"Any time you can have a president and a vice president at launch, I think it's a good sign,\" said Nelson. \"\u2026[Vice President Pence] really has a personal interest in the space program. So, I think it was quite natural that he was going to be here.\" Bolden added, \"This is actually the third administration that has followed this dream of going back to the moon and then on to Mars...That's what's most important: is consistency of purpose in what we do.\" Also in Florida \u2013 CBS News has confirmed a Tampa Bay Times\u00a0report\u00a0that White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany has voted absentee in every Florida primary and general election dating back to 2008. McEnany, a Tampa native, has echoed the president's criticism of mail-in ballots and sent out a series of tweets on Wednesday that linked to articles about voter fraud and cases of mail-in ballot issues in different states.\u00a0 \"Absentee voting has the word absent in it for a reason. \u00a0It means you're absent from the jurisdiction or unable to vote in person,\" said McEnany in a statement. \"President Trump is against the Democrat plan to politicize the coronavirus and expand mass mail-in voting without a reason, which has a high propensity for voter fraud. This is a simple distinction that the media fails to grasp.\"\u00a0 But Florida voters can opt to submit ballots by mail for any reason,\u00a0according to the state Division of Elections. Mitchell\u00a0spoke with the Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections office, which said Florida voters register with the address of their legal residence, and that can differ from where a voter lives if they're temporarily living elsewhere, like college students. And when a voter requests to vote by mail in Florida, his or her request is good through two general election cycles before a renewal request is required. PENNSYLVANIA A Pennsylvania Common Pleas Court judge has denied a county elections board's request to extend the deadline for mail-in ballots to a week after the June 2 primary, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Judge Richard Haaz in Montgomery County did not offer an explanation in the order he issued Wednesday.\u00a0 The request came Tuesday, as Pennsylvania counties struggle to manage an influx of mail-in ballot applications, bringing state-wide totals to 20 times what they were in the 2016 primary. The Montgomery County's Board of Elections had requested an extension after two mail-in ballot blunders in the county, one in which voters received faulty instructions with their ballots and another where they received ballots for the incorrect party.\u00a0 The Board cited reports of voters not receiving their mail-in ballots and other issues in the state's rollout of no-excuse mail-in voting, including a design flaw in the online application that left some voters' apartment numbers off their mail-in ballots.\u00a0\u00a0 TEXAS Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and Secretary Julian Castro are the latest names to be added to the list of speakers for the\u00a0Texas Democratic Party's June convention, the largest online state political convention in the country.\u00a0 Texas Democratic Chair Gilberto Hinojosa, in a statement shared first with\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro, praised Castro, Harris and Warren as \"bold leaders who champion a progressive future for our country.\" He said the state party is \"thrilled that they will be joining us at our convention.\" As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the convention, slated for the first week in June, has been moved to a completely virtual format.\u00a0 Texas Democrats aim to use two broadcast channels for their events, one for the official party business of voting on delegates and one for performances, panels, and guest speakers like Harris and Warren, who will appear in pre-recorded segments.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will also be speaking at the event, creating a solid roster of Democrat political figures who are likely to mirror the party's national convention lineup in Milwaukee in July. \"We're certainly happy to tell every state party in the country...and the DNC as well, what we are doing and how we're getting it done,\" Texas Democrats executive director Manny Garcia previously told CBS News. \"But, I know the challenge for the national convention is much larger than ours.\" GOVERNOR'S MANSION LOOKING AHEAD Virginia state delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy launched her 2021 bid for governor Wednesday, the first Democrat to launch a campaign for the seat. She told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0her run for governor is aimed at changing the \"status quo\" in Virginia, starting with healthcare access, criminal justice reform and economic inequality. In the state house, Foy spearheaded the passing of the Equal Rights Amendment, gun safety reforms and the expansion of Medicaid.\u00a0 She said a big impetus of her run is her own experience as a working mom with two jobs, two mortgages and student loan debt. \"I will be able to look at every single Virginian and say, I see you. I understand the challenges and obstacles you face. And I have the solutions to tackle them, not with false promises, but through smart solutions and policies,\" she said.\u00a0 Originally slated to launch a couple months ago, Foy's plans, and the rest of the political landscape, were rocked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Foy's Wednesday kick-off was all digital, with a\u00a0launch video\u00a0and a\u00a0video statement\u00a0on COVID-19. While the winner on November 2, 2021 wouldn't take office until 2022, Foy said she could see the state still dealing with the pandemic by then.\u00a0 \"We may not have a vaccine for the next 18 to 24 months. So I'm anticipating tackling the challenge of successfully navigating Virginia out of the crisis,\" she said. Foy said she appreciates that Northam has been listening to experts in his coronavirus response but said, \"for me, I would be bolder.\"\u00a0 She says grocery workers and bus drivers should have access to PPEs, and that she'd lead the legislature to pass paid sick days and a vote-by-mail system so that registered voters would be sent a ballot. Currently, Virginia has not changed their vote-by-mail plans for this November, though Foy says it's something the state chambers could act on in their special summer session in August.\u00a0 Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax has expressed interest in running for governor, as well as former Governor Terry McAuliffe and Attorney General Mark Herring. If Foy wins, she would be the first black woman to serve as governor in the nation's history. \"I'm honored to be in the position to change what the face of leadership in Virginia looks like,\" she said.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "During their first and only debate, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris argued about the administration's handling of COVID-19, the Supreme Court, the Swine Flu, climate chang and more. CBS News' fact-checking team evaluated the truth of some of their claims. Here's what we found.   Statement \u2014 Mike Pence: \"That Rose Garden event \u2014 there's been a great deal of speculation about it \u2014 my wife Karen and I were there and honored to be there. Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, were actually tested for coronavirus, and it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise.\"    Claim: Pence says that Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination event was outdoors.\u00a0    Fact check: Partially true    Details:\u00a0    Vice President Pence defends Amy Coney Barrett's nomination event because it was held outdoors, and \"many people\" were tested. But in addition to the outdoor ceremony, President Trump hosted an indoor reception, which was captured on camera by New York Times photographer Doug Mills, who was invited by the White House to photograph some of the scenes inside the White House on the day of the nomination.    One photo shows President Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, Maureen Scalia, Senator Thom Tillis (who later tested positive for COVID-19) and Barrett all speaking, without masks, in tight quarters in the Diplomatic Room. \t\t \t\t \t\t Another photo shows President Trump, Senator Ben Sasse, and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, now hospitalized with COVID-19, in the same room without masks. \t\t \t\t \t\t Yet another photo shows Senator Mike Lee,\u00a0 also now COVID-positive, speaking with Barrett without masks. \t\t \t\t \t\t By Kristin Brown  Statement \u2014 Mike Pence: \"President Trump and I have a plan to improve health care and to protect preexisting conditions for all Americans.\"  Claim: Pence claims that he and Mr. Trump have a plan to protect preexisting conditions. \t  Fact check: Mostly false  In September, President Trump declared that it is now the official policy of the federal government to protect preexisting conditions, and he won't sign any bill that comes to his desk that doesn't protect them. But the fate of the health care law and preexisting conditions is not in Congress' hands right now. The next development on this front is likely to come from the Supreme Court. \t  While the Trump administration has often claimed it would protect preexisting conditions, which are covered by the Affordable Care Act, it has in fact been trying to kill the nation's health care law in the courts. The next Supreme Court case on the law will be heard a week after the election, when Republicans challenge the constitutionality of Obamacare's individual mandate. \t  In June, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to overturn Obamacare, arguing the individual mandate is unconstitutional and so, the rest of the law, which includes preexisting condition protections, should be struck down.\u00a0 \t  At a town hall in September, President Trump claimed to have \"a much better plan,\" though moderator George Stephanopoulos pointed out that he has been in office for 3 1/2 years and has not yet presented a concrete plan to replace Obamacare.\u00a0 \t  Late last month Mr. Trump signed an executive action that purported to be a \"vision\" of a health care plan, but it has no legislative power. Larry Levitt, executive vice president of Kaiser Family Foundation, called the president's vision \"something of a mirage.\"  By: Kathryn Watson  Statement \u2014 Kamala Harris: \"On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing, which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America leading to a $2 trillion-dollar deficit that the American people are going to have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He will get rid of it, and what he will do with the money is invest it in the American people.\"    Claim: Harris says that on the first day of Biden's presidency, he will repeal the 2017 GOP tax cut.    Fact check: Misleading\u00a0  Details:\u00a0  Biden cannot single-handedly repeal the Tax Cut and Jobs Act; it would require an act of Congress. In addition to the White House, Democrats would need to flip three seats in the Senate to have a chance of repealing the act without GOP support.    Without further legislation, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is scheduled to expire between 2025 and 2027, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\u00a0    By Irina Ivanova   Statement \u2014 Mike Pence: \"What's remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord. But we've done it through innovation and we've done it through natural gas, and fracking.\"   Claim: Pence claims the U.S. has reduced CO2 emissions through innovation  Fact check: Misleading   Details:\u00a0   U.S. CO2 emissions decreased in 2017, the first year of the Trump administration, before spiking again in 2018. Emissions declined again in 2019, and are on track to decline in 2020. Most of that decline has taken place because the U.S. has been moving away from coal-powered energy in favor of renewable energy and even more so because of natural gas power produced by fracking. There has also been a steep dropoff in emissions this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0   Climate Action Tracker notes that the pandemic has restricted travel and transport, the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Motor gasoline consumption was down 24% in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.   CAT also noted that natural gas consumption is expected to decrease this year by 3%, \"mainly because of lower consumption in the industrial sector\" and electricity consumption will also drop this year.\u00a0   These declines are still far short of what the U.S. pledged to achieve under the Paris Climate Accord, and CAT says that the Trump administration's \"continuous rollback of climate policy\" and suspension of environmental regulations during the pandemic will \"counteract\" some of the emissions reductions that have resulted.\u00a0   Roughly 190 countries have ratified the climate accord. Some of those countries have failed to reduce CO2 emissions in recent years, but many nations' economies were also adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and experienced emissions reductions.   However, targets under the accord are different for every country, so simply comparing U.S. reductions to emissions of other countries is an unfair comparison. \u00a0   By Adam Aigner-Treworgy  Pence statement: \"When Joe Biden was vice-president of the United States, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus, 2009, when Joe Biden was president, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own chief of staff Ron Klain would say last year, that it was pure luck, and that they did everything possible wrong.\"   Claim: Pence says 60 million Americans contracted Swine Flu   Fact check: Misleading   Details:\u00a0   According to the Centers for Disease Control, from April 2009 to April 2010, there were nearly 61 million cases of the H1N1 Swine Flu in the U.S. That is far more than 7.5 million cases of COVID-19 that have been contracted in the U.S. in the past six months.   But Swine Flu was a much less dangerous and deadly disease than COVID-19. Of those 61 million case of Swine Flu, just 0.004% of those cases, or nearly 275,000, required hospitalization. And less than 12,500 who contracted the disease died.   This hospitalization rate and mortality rate was significantly lower than the number of Americans who die each year from seasonal flu.   A report produced on the 10th anniversary of the Swine Flu found that \"the impact of the H1N1 [swine] virus on the global population during the first year was less severe than that of previous pandemics\" and that \"the United States mounted a complex, multi-faceted and long-term response to the pandemic.\"   Klain did say in 2019 that President Obama's administration got lucky swine flu wasn't more deadly. But Klain now says those comments, made at a conference, were taken out of context.   In May, he told Politico that the Obama administration speedily adapted to the H1N1 situation, \"quickly distributing emergency equipment from the federal stockpile, deferring to public health experts and having them take the lead on messaging.\" He said that was a stark contrast to the way the Trump administration has reacted to the coronavirus.\u00a0   By Stephen Gandel  Statement \u2014 Mike Pence: \"When Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month. And when our armed forces finally went in, it was clear she'd been moved two days earlier.\"  Claim: Pence claims the Obama administration delayed an operation to rescue hostage Kayla Mueller in Syria.  Fact check:\u00a0False  Details:\u00a0  The unsuccessful attempt to rescue Americans held hostage in Syria occurred on July 3, 2014.\u00a0 Planning began on June 22 after the FBI interviewed a European hostage who had been freed and who described the prison where Americans were being held. \u00a0  The plan was first briefed at the White House on June 26 and approved by President Obama the next day, on June 27.\u00a0 It took until July 3 to stage the aircraft and troops to conduct the mission.\u00a0 This was before the U.S. had sent troops back into Iraq, so it was a standing start. \u00a0  Afterward, Mr. Obama said they may have missed the hostages by a day or two. \u00a0  The operation was not mounted in time, but the chronology doesn't support that Mr. Obama and Biden delayed it. The complaints at the Pentagon at the time were that it should not have taken so long \u2013 from June 22 to June 26 \u2013 to present a plan for a time-sensitive military operation to the White House. The delay was not on the administration's side. It was the military in this case that wasn't able to move fast enough.  By David Martin  Statement \u2014 Mike Pence: \"I'm pro-life, I don't apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there's such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth.\"  Claim: Pence claims Joe Biden and Harris support taxpayer-funded abortion \"up to the moment of birth.\"  Fact check: Misleading  Details:  The concept of \"abortion up until birth\" is not something that happens in medical practice, says Jen Villavicencio, a practicing OB/GYN. \"Abortion as Pence describes does not exist,\" she said. Terminations after about 24 weeks of pregnancy are only legally allowed to happen in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, when the fetus is no longer viable, or to save the life of the woman. Elective abortions later in pregnancy do not exist and are not legal.  Roe v. Wade and subsequent Supreme Court precedent legalizes abortion up until fetal viability, which usually happens near or at the end of the second trimester. According to the\u00a0Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive research group that supports abortion access, 43 states ban abortion at some point during pregnancy and seven do not. In those seven states, individual state laws determine access to abortion later in pregnancy. According to Villavicencio, patients are only able to access abortion later in pregnancy if the fetus is no longer viable or to preserve the life or health of the mother.  The vast majority of abortions in the U.S. happen early in pregnancy,\u00a0according to the CDC\u00a0\u2014 90.9% of abortions occurred at or before the 13th week of pregnancy in 2016, the most recent year for which data is available. Only 1.3% of abortions in 2016 happened at or after the 21st week of pregnancy, according to the CDC.  Pence's terminology, \"late-term abortion\" is not a medical term. When discussing abortion later in pregnancy, doctors refer to it by trimester, i.e. second-trimester or third-trimester abortion.  Harris and Biden support current abortion laws, which allow for abortion later in pregnancy in very limited circumstances, as outlined above. They support taxpayer-funded abortion, too. In the summer of 2019, Biden also abandoned his support for the Hyde Amendment, a 1976 rule that prohibits the use of federal dollars from funding abortion services except in the cases of rape, incest or life-threatening circumstances. Harris also supports the repeal of the Hyde Amendment. Biden/Harris also support restoring federal funding to Planned Parenthood.\u00a0  By Kate Smith  Statement \u2014 Kamala Harris: \"There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created within the White House an office that basically was responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got away \u2014 they they got rid of it.\" Mike Pence: \"Not true.\"  Claim: Harris claims Trump got rid of an Obama White House office that monitored pandemics and that he has a \"weird obsession\" with dismantling Obama-Biden accomplishments  Fact check:\u00a0Partially true and no evidence for \"obsession\" claim  Details:\u00a0  The Global Health Security and Biodefense unit \u2014 responsible for pandemic preparedness \u2014 was established in 2015 by President Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, as part of the national security council.\u00a0  In May 2018, under the Trump administration, the team was disbanded. Its head, Timothy Ziemer, the top national security council official charged with leading U.S. response against a pandemic, left the White House.  But some members of the global health and security team were reassigned into other NSC units that addressed pandemic response. And while the \"pandemic response team\" as a unit was largely disbanded, the departure of some members came about as a result of \"streamlining\" efforts under then-national security adviser John Bolton.  There is not enough evidence to support the claim that Mr. Trump dismantled the office for the reason given by Harris.  By Nicole Sganga  Statement \u2014 Kamala Harris: \"Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that.\"  Claim: Harris claims Biden will not end fracking.  Fact check: Inconclusive  Details:\u00a0  Fracking, short for hydraulic fracturing, is a drilling method for extracting natural gas from shale formations underground by injecting liquid at high pressure. Since 2005, the use of fracking in the U.S. has\u00a0grown exponentially. Some energy experts\u00a0forecast\u00a0the U.S. will be the world's top exporter of natural gas within the next few years.  However, fracking is a substantial source of jobs and revenue in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, where some 32,000 workers are employed in the fracking and natural gas industry.\u00a0Biden told voters\u00a0there in July that fracking \"is not on the chopping block,\" though his campaign says he supports no new fracking on federal land.\u00a0  Harris says that Biden will not end fracking, and that he's been \"very clear\" on the issue. But Biden has changed his exact answer on this question many times and has at least once forced his campaign to clarify his statements.  By Kristin Brown and Jeff Berardelli  Statement \u2014 Mike Pence: \"President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done, and that was, he suspended all travel from China. The second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator (Harris), Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic.\"   Fact check: Inconclusive, mostly false   Details:\u00a0  On suspending travel: This is mostly false. The travel policy announced by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on January 31 prohibited non-U.S. citizens, other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S. There was no restriction on Americans from traveling back and forth from China.\u00a0   On January 24, a week before the travel restrictions were imposed, the CDC confirmed two cases of the novel coronavirus in the U.S. from individuals returning from Wuhan, China.   President Trump frequently defends his administration's early handling of COVID-19 by touting his decision to partially restrict travel from China in January 2020. However, his so-called \"ban\" did not actually rstrict travel, it merely limited it. His claims are misleading because there were 11 exemptions, including permanent US citizens and immediate family, and residents of \"Special Administrative Regions\" Hong Kong and Macau.\u00a0   According to the Associated Press, nearly 8,000 Chinese and foreign nationals entered the U.S. several months after the ban was enacted. The regulations did not go into effect until February 2, 2020.   On xenophobia: This is inconclusive. During an Iowa campaign appearance on January 31 \u2013 the same day restrictions were announced \u2013 Biden said that \"this is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria and xenophobia \u2014 hysterical xenophobia \u2014 and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science.\"\u00a0   But he did not explicitly mention or link his statement to travel restrictions announced by Azar earlier that day. The Biden campaign claims he was not directly referring to the China travel ban. Biden has also repeatedly accused the president of xenophobia on Twitter. Eventually, in April 2020, the campaign said Biden supported the ban.\u00a0   \"Science supported this ban, therefore he did too,\" said deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield.

            "article_content": "A\u00a0new CBS News poll\u00a0shows that Americans' views of the economy have plummeted due to the Coronavirus pandemic, but many are optimistic about its ability to rebound.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0notes 27% of respondents said the economy is in good shape, while 61% said it is in bad shape. In December, 59% of Americans said the economy was in good shape, while just under a third said it was in bad shape.\u00a0 Despite those feelings about the current state of the economy, 58% of Americans are optimistic about the U.S. economy's ability to quickly recover, while 42% are pessimistic. There are partisan divides over that question, though. Eighty percent of Republicans are optimistic about a quick recovery, compared to just 44% of Democrats. Fifty-six percent of independents are optimistic about a speedy recovery. Among those who work full time or part time, 28% of respondents said they were very concerned about losing their job or having reduced work hours, and 26% said they were somewhat concerned about that. Twenty-three percent said they were not very concerned about job loss or reduced work hours, and 15% said they were not at all concerned. A new analysis from the\u00a0Economic Policy Institute\u00a0(EPI) shows how staggering jobless claims could be when the Labor Department reports last week's initial unemployment insurance claims on Thursday. The EPI model, which was released on Tuesday, projects that 3.4 million Americans filed new unemployment insurance claims for the week ending March 21. That would shatter the record for claims in a single week, which has been published since 1967. The highest number of claims in a single week was 695,000 in the beginning of October 1982, during a recession. The highest weekly number during the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was 665,000 claims in March of 2009. The EPI analysis says that 3.4 million Americans moving from employment to unemployment would mean a rise in the unemployment rate from 3.5% to 5.5% in a single week. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN Last week Joe Biden addressed the public on camera for only six minutes. Today he sat for three long-form television interviews from his new basement studio. Biden mostly focused on how the elements of his\u00a0COVID-19 response plan\u00a0could be used now by the Trump administration,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0writes. Biden told \"The View\" he tries not to directly criticize the president, preferring to cite his disagreements and not calling him a liar. (Even though he said\u00a0last week Trump lied about Americans getting COVID tests if they want one.) \"I mean, what is he talking about?\" Biden responded with suspicion on CNN about the president's insistence today that he hopes to have the economy up and running by Easter. For immediate relief, Biden floated on MSNBC the idea that the U.S. could forgive up to $10,000 in student loan debt for individuals \"up to their ears\" in debt. Now, the former vice president's days start with two briefings on the virus response and the economy, Biden said on ABC, and he is also focusing on trimming the list of 12 to 15 women he's considering for vice president, if and when he officially clinches the Democratic nomination. \u00a0 During his third interview of the day, Biden on MSNBC was asked about discrimination against Asian-Americans and how the president\u00a0tweeted\u00a0he won't stand for the hate. Biden admitted he was \"happy\" the president said he wasn't going to put up with the xenophobia \"no matter how he got there.\" Biden\u00a0 also compared the president to a \"yo-yo\" because \"all of a sudden\" Trump is now \"tough on China\" and \"softening his xenophobia.\" Soon after he made the comparison, Biden said he regretted his phrasing. BY THE NUMBERS PANDEMIC POLLING According to a\u00a0new CBS News poll,\u00a0most Americans see a months-long pandemic fight ahead, notes\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The poll found that 53% of Americans think President Trump is doing a good job handling the outbreak, and 54% are optimistic about his administration's ability to handle it from here. However, for information about the virus, fewer Americans (44%) trust President Trump than they do medical professionals (88%), the CDC (82%), family and friends (73%) and governors (66%.) The breakdown in trust of the president is especially partisan. A large majority of Republicans (90%) trust the president for accurate information and just 14% of Democrats rely on him for the same information. The partisan divide is also notable for trust of the national media for information. According to the poll, 72% of Democrats trust the national media while only 13% of Republicans do. BIDEN V. TRUMP A new\u00a0poll\u00a0shows it's a tight head-to-head matchup race between former Vice President Joe Biden and Donald Trump. According to the latest Monmouth University Poll,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says Biden leads Trump 48% to 45% among registered voters. That same poll found Biden, who is the frontrunner to become the democratic presidential nominee, has 89% of support from Democratic voters, while Trump has the support of 90% of Republican voters. Independent voters are currently split between Trump's 45% and Biden's 44%. Breaking it down further, Biden has a larger edge among voters in the swing counties across the country. Looking at approximately 300 so-called swing counties where the margin of victory was less than ten points for either candidate in 2016, the Monmouth polling found 50% back Biden compared with 41% who support Trump. In 2016, Clinton won the cumulative vote in these counties by 1%. At the same time, the polling finds Biden gets much of his support nationally from younger voters, voters of color, women and those with college degrees. Among voters under 35 years old, Biden leads Trump 56% to 34%. Among voters of color, he leads Trump 66% to 25%. Among women overall, Biden leads Trump 53% to 40% including overwhelming support among women of color 77% to 14% and support among white women with a college degree 63% to 33%. Trump gets much of his support among white voters overall, leading Biden 56% to 38%. He also leads among men overall 50% to 40% and voters ages 35 to 54, 53% to 40%. In terms of education, Trump leads among voters without a college degree 51% to 41%, while Biden leads among voters with a four-year degree 61% to 32%. Meanwhile, Trump appears to be getting a bump in support amid the growing coronavirus pandemic. According to the latest\u00a0Gallup poll, 49% of U.S. adults now approve of the job he is doing as president, up from 44% earlier this month. Trump has even seen slight boosts among Independents and Democrats from earlier this month, tying his best approval among both groups to date. Gallup suggests his response to the coronavirus may be behind the increases. Sixty percent of Americans approve overall his response to the pandemic, while 38% disapprove. That support breaks down further along party lines: 94% of Republicans approve of his response, compared to 60% of Independents, and 27% of Democrats. PRIMARY CONCERNS CALENDAR CHANGES Rhode Island and Delaware became the latest states to postpone presidential primaries due to coronavirus concerns. Both states had primaries originally scheduled for April 28. On Monday, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo signed the executive order directing the Board of Elections to take steps to hold that primary instead on June 2.\u00a0 CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says the order also directs the Board of Elections to work with the secretary of state's office to determine a plan to hold a \"predominately mail-ballot primary.\" The move comes after the Board of Elections voted to move its contest and sent the recommendation to the governor for approval. \u00a0On Tuesday, Delaware Governor John Carney modified a state of emergency declaration in his state to also postpone the primary there to June 2. The two states now join eight other states and Puerto Rico which have already postponed primary contests. Wyoming, Hawaii and Alaska have also made changes by canceling in-person voting and moving exclusively to vote by mail. Several other states are also still considering moving their primaries in order to help keep people healthy amid the spread of coronavirus. BALLOT MEASURES As Wisconsin marches ahead with its April 7 primary,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says the state is reporting a large spike in absentee ballot requests compared to previous spring elections. The Wisconsin Election Commission says it received 554,116 absentee ballot requests as of Tuesday morning. That's more than double the number of absentee ballots issued for the 2016 primary, when 249,503 absentee ballots were sent to voters. Wisconsin is also working to get online voter registration back up and running after a federal court ordered last Friday that it needs to remain open until March 30. The state is still planning to offer in-person voting for its primary as well. On Monday, the Wisconsin Election Commission issued a call for more people to sign up as poll workers to replace the number of older workers who would be at risk from coronavirus. GOVERNOR'S MANSION CRY FOR HELP Governors in some of the most affected states are continuing to call for more support from the White House, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0And now, with a coronavirus emergency package close to the goal line, they're also calling on Congress.\u00a0 Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, a Republican, spoke about how the \"partisan behavior\" in Congress \"is simply not an option now.\" \"Make a deal,\" Baker said Tuesday afternoon. \"I think it's critical that these folks find a way to 'Yes,' and create some clarity and some certainty, not just for state government and local government but for the people of the country who are waiting to see the federal government lead on this issue.\" The Republican Governors Association also sent out a\u00a0letter\u00a0to Congressional leadership on Monday, calling for direct assistance for Governors and their states.\u00a0 Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said while the White House has indicated to him that it will deliver more ventilators to the state, the state still needs the \"full might of the federal government\" and called for the use of the Defense Production Act to have private manufacturers build more healthcare equipment. \"Of all the reasons that the federal government exists, this is the most important and the most basic. We are on a war-time footing right now, and we need an allocation of resources to the front lines that prioritizes where the battle is being waged most aggressively,\" he said. In his presser, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, also called for the implementation of the Defense Production Act and said, \"I'm not asking the federal government to help New York just to help New York \u2014 I'm asking for everyone.\u00a0 If we learn how to blunt the impact here and bend the curve here, we can help other states who are next.\" Currently, New York has the most COVID-19 cases out of any state, with about 25,000 cases.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has spoken before about the working relationship he has had with Cuomo but criticized him in a Fox News Town Hall on Tuesday and claimed he had the chance to buy ventilators before. \u00a0\"He's supposed to be buying his own ventilators,\" Trump said. \"We're going to help, but if you think about Governor Cuomo, we're building him four hospitals, we're building him four medical centers. We're working very, very hard for the people of New York.\" In his town hall, Trump set the goal of \"reopening\" the U.S. economy by Easter and lifting restrictions on businesses.\u00a0 This is in contrast with the longer timeline public health officials have set for battling COVID-19 and adds to the conversation about balancing the needs of an economy with public safety. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick\u00a0said Monday night\u00a0that America should \"get back to work\" and that those above 70 will \"take care of ourselves.\" Montana Attorney General Tim Fox, a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the state, praised the president's optimism in a call with reporters on Tuesday.\u00a0 When asked about Trump's timeline, Pritzker said he doesn't think Trump \"is taking into account the true damage that this will do to our country.\" He added, \"If you don't have these restrictions on, the damage that would be done, the lives that would be lost, the overrunning of our healthcare system, would lead to real devastation. So I'm very, very concerned about what the President is saying.\"",

            "article_content": "With voters in 14 states preparing to head to the polls for Super Tuesday, Joe Biden's campaign has steadily rolled out a slew of high-profile endorsements in key states, consolidating support from the moderate and establishment wings of the Democratic Party after his decisive victory in the\u00a0South Carolina primary.\u00a0CBSNews.com writer Melissa Quinn\u00a0reports\u00a0the floodgates seemingly opened Saturday in the wake of Biden's win in the Palmetto State, which propelled him to second in the\u00a0national delegate race, trailing Bernie Sanders by just two delegates. As the former vice president was projected to win the state just after polls closed, former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe\u00a0announced\u00a0on CNN his support for Biden, saying he has the \"best chance of winning\" the state in November. Joining McAuliffe were fellow Virginians Senator\u00a0Tim Kaine, Congressman\u00a0Bobby Scott\u00a0and Congresswoman\u00a0Jennifer Wexton, who unseated a GOP incumbent in 2018. Also closing ranks around Biden were Congresswoman\u00a0Veronica Escobar\u00a0of Texas, Congressman\u00a0Gil Cisneros\u00a0of California and Senator\u00a0Tammy Duckworth\u00a0of Illinois \u2014   the seventh U.S. senator to back the former vice president. California, Texas and Virginia all hold their primaries Super Tuesday, when a total of 1,357 delegates are up for grabs. California and Texas will award the most, 415 and 228 respectively. Among those announcing their support for Biden on Monday was former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who called him the candidate \"who can assemble the largest, most diverse coalition possible to defeat Trump and lead our country following the trauma of Trump's presidency.\" In a statement Reid said, \"Biden will be a much-needed stabilizing force following Trump's disastrous term, offering a positive and progressive alternative to Trump's dark vision of racism, xenophobia and policies built on cruelty and exclusion.\" Reid, who represented Nevada in the Senate for 30 years, added, \"I believe Biden is best able to defeat Donald Trump and enact the policies we all care about.\" The former vice president is also expected to snag support from his former competitors in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Amy Klobuchar, who\u00a0suspended her presidential campaign\u00a0on Monday, is expected to appear alongside Biden at a rally in Dallas on Monday night. Pete Buttigieg, who\u00a0dropped out\u00a0of the presidential race Sunday,\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Biden in Dallas on Monday night. Among the field of Democratic presidential candidates, Biden has always had a high number of endorsements in competitive states like Iowa and New Hampshire, but they didn't translate into wins in either of the two states. In Iowa, Biden came in fourth and in New Hampshire, he placed fifth, and he came in second, far behind Sanders, in the Nevada caucuses. But that changed in South Carolina, where he received the\u00a0coveted endorsement\u00a0of Congressman Jim Clyburn, a Democratic kingmaker in the Palmetto State. Among Democratic primary voters,\u00a047% said\u00a0Clyburn's endorsement was an important factor in their vote. Biden thanked the South Carolina congressman for helping drive him to victory in the state, saying he \"brought me back.\" The field of Democrats seeking the presidential nomination has thinned in the wake of the South Carolina primary. Tom Steyer\u00a0ended his campaign\u00a0on Saturday, followed by Buttigieg on Sunday and Klobuchar on Monday. This leaves five candidates in the race: Sanders, Biden, Mike Bloomberg, Tulsi Gabbard, and Elizabeth Warren. Biden warned about the ramifications of Sanders winning the nomination in an\u00a0interview on Monday\u00a0with\u00a0CBS News political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns,\u00a0saying a ticket led by Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, could jeopardize Democrats running for the House and Senate. \"There's an awful lot of people who are running for office who don't want to run with Bernie at the top of the ticket as a self-proclaimed socialist,\" Biden said. \"Imagine here in Texas or in North Carolina or in Georgia, the idea, if I said to you, 'This is an open test. You're running for office. Do you want a very popular, self-proclaimed socialist or a popular mainstream Democrat running at the top of the ticket?' My guess is in most states, they'd say no.\" The former vice president suggested his flurry of endorsements, including from Democrats in battleground states, stems from the realization that the success of other candidates could hinge on the eventual Democratic presidential nominee. \"It's not going to be enough just to beat Donald Trump. We have to win back the Senate, we have to keep the House,\" he said. \"Whether they're right or not, those people who are running for those offices think that Bernie was not likely to help them, but hurt them in their pursuit of their Senate or their House seat or their governor's seat.\" *CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson contributed to this report ELIZABETH WARREN As opposing candidates are dropping from the race,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says Warren is focusing on telling voters what she'd do in office. Ahead of a Los Angeles speech Monday night, the Massachusetts senator released a pair of plans,\u00a0one\u00a0that includes a $400 billion stimulus package \"to head off the potential economic impact of coronavirus\" and\u00a0another\u00a0to improve conditions for farm and food chain industry employees. At the start of January, Warren had released a plan on preventing, containing and treating infectious disease in light of the spread of coronavirus. This new plan echoes her speech in Houston Saturday, where she argued she is better suited to take on coronavirus then Sanders, Biden and Bloomberg. It says she would make certain uninsured Americans can get free care and evaluation for the virus, and that she would create an emergency paid leave program so that anyone with the CDC's outlined symptoms can be paid for time in quarantine. Warren's farmworkers rights plan specifies that she would include farmworkers in her push for a $15 minimum wage as well as replace the H2-A agricultural guest worker visa program with an immigrant worker visa that has full labor protections built in. Like her coronavirus economic plan, this one repeatedly references previous proposals and how they will work off of her new ones.\u00a0 AMY KLOBUCHAR Klobuchar is suspending her presidential campaign and plans to endorse Biden at a rally in Dallas on Monday night, a campaign spokesman told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga, just hours before voters in 14 states go to the polls on Super Tuesday. While the Minnesota Democrat often boasted about kicking off her campaign in the middle of a blizzard, the end of her run was marked by a storm of frustrations and stalled momentum. Aides and allies told CBS News they took solace that her campaign performed better and lasted longer than many had initially expected. Over the course of the campaign, Klobuchar was quick to admit she did not have the name recognition or financial resources enjoyed by some of her rivals. Besides hitting the trail, her prospects hinged on her performance in the primary debates, which were crucial for introducing herself to a national audience and raising money. Klobuchar positioned herself as a moderate Midwesterner who could unite the party, casting doubt on the feasibility of progressive policy proposals like free college tuition and Medicare for All put forward by Sanders. She also largely steered clear of criticizing Biden, given the similarity in their views. Armed with her neighborly appeal, Klobuchar bet that a strong finish in the Iowa caucuses would catapult her candidacy into the top tier. She set out to visit all of the state's 99 counties, a feat she accomplished just before the weeks-long Senate impeachment trial trapped her on Capitol Hill. She came in fifth place in Iowa, signaling that voters in that state did not agree with her proposition that a Midwest moderate was best suited to win back the heartland. In what would prove to be the high water mark of her bid, Klobuchar managed to bounce back with a strong showing at debate in New Hampshire just days before the Granite State's primary. She came in third, ahead of Warren, a surprising finish that allowed her to continue on to Nevada and South Carolina. There were indications earlier Monday that Klobuchar's bid was coming to an end. After an event in Salt Lake City, Utah, the campaign held reporters for over two hours, with the lights turned off and no staff in sight. As late as Monday morning, a senior adviser said they had received no \"official word\" of her exiting the race but declined to elaborate. Multiple aides said they had expected her to remain in the race through Super Tuesday. The senator broke the news to her staff shortly after 1 p.m. ET on a conference call from Salt Lake City on Monday, two campaign officials told CBS News. Klobuchar thanked her team for their work on the \"wild ride\" of the campaign, telling staff that she was proud of the operation they built. She also acknowledged that the outcome was not what they wished, but that she felt it was right to consolidate support around Biden. The call lasted around 20 minutes, and Klobuchar and staff members were sad and a bit shell-shocked. One longtime Klobuchar ally told the initial plan to remain in the race through Super Tuesday was becoming untenable as polls showed her coming in behind Sanders in her own state of Minnesota, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. \u00a0\"The feeling in the campaign really starting to change last week,\" this person said. ON THE $$$ ICYMI over the weekend, Sanders' campaign announced Sunday it raised $46.5 million in February, the most of any\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0in a given month in the 2020 election cycle.\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says the figure shatters the previous monthly record of $25 million, set by the Sanders campaign in January. According to the campaign, the cash haul came from more than 2.2 million donations, including contributions from more than 350,000 donors who were giving to the campaign for the first time. The Vermont senator's fundraising efforts were fueled by victories in the early primary states of New Hampshire and Nevada, and a first-place finish in the popular vote in Iowa. The campaign said 99.9% of Sanders' donors have not reached the federal limit on individual contributions, meaning they can give again. The average donation in February was $21. Warren\u00a0also\u00a0announced\u00a0her February fundraising numbers on Sunday, saying she pulled in $29 million, a record for her campaign. Her cash haul included $2.8 million on the day of Warren's\u00a0well-received debate performance\u00a0in Nevada on February 19. According to Warren campaign manager Roger Lau, 250,000 people donated for the first time in February, bringing the campaign's total number of donors since its launch to more than 1.25 million. The average February donation was $31. Read more here\u00a0on how the candidate plans to use some of that cash. SOUTH CAROLINA After months of carrying a double-digit poll lead\u2014that\u00a0dramatically winnowed\u00a0in the days leading up to the South Carolina Democratic primary\u2014Biden won the state's primary contest with 48.7% on Saturday. Gaining 39 delegates in the \"first in the South\" primary state,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0says Biden received more than double the amount of delegates on Saturday night than he had in the first three early state contests combined. \u00a0The CBS News South Carolina exit\u00a0poll\u00a0show that Biden dominated in almost every category of South Carolina voters\u2014coming up short only among non-college educated white men, people who never attend religious services and younger voters. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders edged out victories among voters ages 17-44 but came up short among black voters ages 30-44. According to the South Carolina Democratic Party, more than 600 campaign stops were made by the candidates throughout the cycle and a CBS News analysis shows that combined the candidates spent at least 145 days over 75 visits in the state. Amid reports that Republicans were being\u00a0encouraged\u00a0to participate in the open Democratic primary, exit polls showed only 5% of those who voted usually thought of themselves as a Republican. The SCDP reported record-breaking voter turnout with 539,020 South Carolina Democrats and Independents voting in Saturday's contest. This number smashed the 2008 Democratic primary record by nearly 7,000 votes but the total turnout percentage was just 16.33%, compared to the 23% of registered voters who turned out in the 2008 primary, where then-Senator Barack Obama won the contest with 55.4% of the vote. As\u00a0predicted\u00a0by early absentee ballot returns, more women (59%) voted than men and black voters comprised nearly 60% of those who voted. Among black voters, 61% voted for Biden with Sanders coming in in second with only 17%. Health care ranked as the top issue for South Carolina voters and, while it was important for voters that the Democratic party nominate a candidate who agreed with them on major issues, more than half of those who voted said they would rather see the party nominate a candidate who could beat President Trump. Biden won in every geographical region of the state\u2014from the more conservative upstate down to the more liberal Low Country. More voters who live in small cities and rural areas came out than those in larger cities (population 50,000+) and the suburbs \u2014 and population areas that Biden won. Tom Steyer, who had seen a notable rise in polls in recent months, ultimately came up short, receiving 59,917 votes, which was 11% of the overall vote. After having invested heavily in the state spending more than $20 million in ads, Steyer did not reach the 15% threshold to receive any delegates and\u00a0dropped out\u00a0of the race Saturday evening. During an emotional speech that was interrupted with cheers of \"we love you, Tom!\" from supporters, Steyer said that he would still be fighting for South Carolinians. \"When the Lord closes a door, he opens a window. I will climb through that window and crawl through it with you,\" he said. TEXAS The second-biggest delegate prize on Super Tuesday is Texas, which will award 228 pledged national delegates, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Democrats have ramped up their efforts in the days leading up to the primary, hoping to score points in the delegate-rich state.\u00a0A CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0poll released on Sunday showed Sanders with the lead in Texas, with 30% of likely primary voters saying he was their top choice. Biden was in second (26%), followed by Warren (17%) and Bloomberg (13%). The poll, taken February 27-29, had a margin of error of +/- 6.2%. Candidates need 15% support statewide or in Senate districts to win delegates. Sanders, who has led the most recent Texas polls, spent the weekend of the Nevada caucuses crisscrossing Texas. Thousands of supporters attended his rallies in El Paso, San Antonio, Houston and Austin, where he repeatedly said he would win Texas' primary. \"On television, they say you know Texas is a conservative state, it's a red state. I don't believe it for a minute,\" Sanders said at his Houston rally. \"If our people stand together, come out to vote, we're going to win here in Texas.\" Sanders' five public events in 2020 trailed only Bloomberg for public events held in the state in this calendar year. With the exception of Bloomberg, Sanders has also outspent all of his other Democratic competitors on the airwaves in Texas, dropping almost $5 million on advertisements, according to Kantar/CMAG data. Part of Sanders' polling strength has been his standing with Latino voters. A\u00a0Univision\u00a0poll released on Friday showed Sanders was leading with 31% support from Latino voters, followed by Bloomberg (23%), Biden (19%) and Warren (8%). The poll, taken February 21-26, had a margin of error of +/- 5.5%. Biden, who had a huge lead in Texas polls until the calendar turned to 2020, spent his final day before Super Tuesday holding rallies in Houston and Dallas, hoping to capitalize on momentum from his strong finish in South Carolina. Biden's evening event in Dallas is set to feature endorsements from Klobuchar and Buttigieg, who have suspended their campaigns. That could give his campaign a final jolt before voting tomorrow. Recent polling has shown that Buttigieg and Klobuchar combined for 8% to 12% of the vote in Texas. In an interview on Monday with\u00a0CBS News political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns, Biden\u00a0echoed\u00a0concerns from some of his high profile Texas congressional endorsers about Sanders' possible effect on down ballot races. \"There's an awful lot of people who are running for office who don't want to run with Bernie at the top of the ticket as a self-proclaimed socialist,\" Biden said in the interview with CBS News in Houston. \"Imagine here in Texas or in North Carolina or in Georgia, the idea, if I said to you, 'This is an open test. You're running for office. Do you want a very popular, self-proclaimed socialist or a popular mainstream Democrat running at the top of the ticket?' My guess is in most states, they'd say no.\" Nobody has spent more money or poured more resources into Texas than Bloomberg. He has more than 180 staffers on the ground in Texas and 19 offices around the state, giving him an unrivaled ground game form a sheer paid staff perspective. Bloomberg has blanketed the Texas airwaves by spending more than $47 million of advertisements. He has also held 13 public events in the state, more than his rivals, even though he jumped into the race last. \"We want to come in number one,\" said Bloomberg's Texas State Director Ashlea Graves Turner. \"We've built the biggest infrastructure that Texas has ever seen for a statewide candidate, especially a presidential candidate.\" In the closing days, Bloomberg made trips to Houston and San Antonio, where part of his pitch included his ability to handle crises like coronavirus. Warren's campaign has been on the ground in Texas the longest of the campaigns remaining and has dozens of staffers spread around the state. Warren made two trips to Texas in the final week before Super Tuesday with rallies in San Antonio on Thursday and Houston on Saturday. In Houston, she acknowledged her campaign's struggles in the early states, but said she believes it can turn around. \"I'll be the first to say that the first four contests haven't gone exactly as I'd hoped,\" Warren said. \"But Super Tuesday is three days away and we're looking forward to gaining as many delegates to the convention as we can \u00a0\u2014 from California to right here in Texas.\" Her high-profile Texas endorsers, former Obama Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Congressman Joaquin Castro, campaigned around the state for her on the final weekend before the primary. While Warren's campaign has spent about $900,000 on advertising in Texas, the Persist PAC, which supports her, has spent more than $2.6 million. Gabbard is also in Texas on Monday for an event in Austin. A key wrinkle in all of this: Just over 1 million people voted early or by mail in the Democratic primary, according to the Texas Secretary of State's website. Early voting ended last Friday and mailed ballots need to be counted. The Texas Secretary of State's office says those voters are not able to change their votes, even if a candidate has dropped out of the race. The turnout for Democrats in Texas' 15 most populated counties has eclipsed turnout in 2016's Democratic primary, but has not matched the record numbers from the 2008 Democratic primary. CALIFORNIA As of Monday evening, more than 3.5 million in California have already returned their ballots. Election and data experts in the state expect total turnout this year to be close to 50%, which would mean around 10 million total votes. Voters who have cast early ballots for candidates no longer in the race are not allowed to change their ballots. According to Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data Inc., more than 500,000 votes were cast for candidates no longer in the race since early voting began on February 3. This would be about 5% of the total eventual turnout in the state.\u00a0\u00a0Another group to keep an eye on are the so called \"perfect\" voters \u2014   the ones who have participated in the last five elections but are not turning in their ballots as fast. Mitchell's data shows that so far, only about 40% of those \"perfect\" voters have turned in their ballots. In 2016 and 2008, more than 9 in 10 of these voters participated and this year, Mitchell expects turnout among this group to be just as high.\u00a0\u00a0\"There is a segment of Democratic perfect voters, voters that have voted five of the last five elections that are not turning in their ballots as fast. And we know those people are going to vote. They voted five of the last five elections,\" Mitchell said. \"They voted in the 2014 primary and the general, which were the lowest turnout elections we've had in forever and they still haven't voted. Well, it's not because they said 'I just don't care anymore,' it's because they're waiting to see what happens in probably South Carolina. I expect those people to turnout.\"\u00a0\u00a0In the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, only 9% said the results out of South Carolina will be a \"major\" factor in their decision, compared to the nearly 40% who said what happened in South Carolina will have no impact on their vote. IN THE HOUSE In addition to the presidential primaries on Super Tuesday, 120 congressional districts will also be holding primaries on Super Tuesday, and about three-quarters of these are in the delegate-rich states of Texas and California. Here's\u00a0some interesting House races to watch on Tuesday\u00a0via\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro:",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden slammed the Trump administration's response to the growing\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0outbreak, calling the lack of available testing a \"colossal\" failure while laying out his own plan to combat the virus. Biden delivered a speech Thursday afternoon in Wilmington, Delaware, as President Trump and Congress scramble to address the crisis, which has roiled financial markets and forced the cancellation of dozens of public events nationwide. Mr. Trump announced new restrictions on travelers from Europe during an address to the nation on Wednesday night that failed to calm nerves on Wall Street. In his speech, Biden said he had created an advisory council to advise him on how to respond to the crisis. His campaign released a lengthy two-pronged plan to address the public health aspect of the virus as well as its economic impact. \"The core principle is simple: public health professionals must be the ones making our public health decisions and communicating with the American people,\" Biden said. The former vice president's proposal would establish mobile testing sites and make tests available for all Americans at no charge. \"The administration's failure on testing is colossal, and it's a failure of planning, leadership and execution,\" Biden said. He said the White House should provide a daily report of how many tests have been done and direct more resources to vaccine research. Biden also said it was a \"national disgrace\" that millions of Americans do not have paid sick leave, saying that his plan would ensure workers get paid time off. \"No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you this: When I'm president, we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better,\" Biden said. \"We'll lead with science. We'll listen to the experts. We'll heed their advice. And we'll build American leadership, and rebuild it, to rally the world to meet the global threats we're likely to face again.\" Biden criticized Mr. Trump for his characterization of the coronavirus as a \"foreign virus,\" saying the U.S. \"should not fall back on xenophobia\" in its response. \"The coronavirus does not have a political affiliation,\" Biden said. \"Downplaying it, being overly dismissive, or spreading misinformation is only going to hurt us.\"\u00a0 He said the U.S. should be working with other countries to address the outbreak and leading a \"coordinated, global response,\" in a shot against the president's decision to restrict travel. Senator Bernie Sanders, Biden's rival in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, planned to deliver his own speech on the coronavirus later Thursday. The dueling remarks come just days before Sunday's Democratic debate, which has been moved from Arizona to Washington, D.C., because of concerns over the virus.\u00a0 The pandemic continued to batter financial markets on Thursday as stocks\u00a0plunged again\u00a0and trading was forced to a halt over the president's decision to impose restrictions on European travelers. At the White House, Mr. Trump nonetheless told reporters\u00a0that \"the markets are gonna be just fine.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0introduced a legislative package to respond to the spread of the coronavirus, with measures including free testing, paid emergency sick leave and increasing funds for food security programs and Medicaid. It is unclear when this legislation will face a vote in the House, as Pelosi remains in touch with the administration and is continuing to hash out details with Republicans. Several senators have also closed their Washington offices. Republican Senator Rick Scott announced Thursday that he is in self-quarantine, as he was in contact last week with a member of the Brazilian delegation who tested positive for the virus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Thursday that a planned recess for next week would be canceled in order to address the coronavirus crisis. Alan He contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 With voters in 14 states preparing to head to the polls for Super Tuesday, Joe Biden's campaign has steadily rolled out a slew of high-profile endorsements in key states, consolidating support from the moderate and establishment wings of the Democratic Party after his decisive victory in the South Carolina primary. The former vice president was endorsed Monday night in Dallas by Pete Buttigieg, who dropped out of the race Sunday night. Later that night, at a rally in Dallas, Amy Klobuchar, who\u00a0dropped out of the race earlier Monday, and Texas native son,\u00a0Beto O'Rourke, who dropped out of the race in November, threw their support to Biden as well. The floodgates seemingly opened Saturday in the wake of Biden's win in the Palmetto State, which propelled him to second in the national delegate race, trailing Senator Bernie Sanders by just two delegates. As the former vice president was projected to win the state just after polls closed, former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe announced on CNN his support for Biden, saying he has the \"best chance of winning\" the state in November. Joining McAuliffe were fellow Virginians Senator\u00a0Tim Kaine, Congressman\u00a0Bobby Scott and Congresswoman\u00a0Jennifer Wexton, who unseated a GOP incumbent in 2018. Texas Congresswoman\u00a0Veronica Escobar, California Congressman\u00a0Gil Cisneros and Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth, the seventh U.S. senator to back the former vice president, all also closed ranks around Biden. California, Texas and Virginia all hold their primaries Super Tuesday, when a total of 1,357 delegates are up for grabs. California and Texas will award the most, 415 and 228 respectively. Among those announcing their support for Biden on Monday was former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who called him the candidate \"who can assemble the largest, most diverse coalition possible to defeat Trump and lead our country following the trauma of Trump's presidency.\" \"Biden will be a much-needed stabilizing force following Trump's disastrous term, offering a positive and progressive alternative to Trump's dark vision of racism, xenophobia and policies built on cruelty and exclusion,\" Reid, who represented Nevada in the Senate for 30 years, said in a statement. \"I believe Biden is best able to defeat Donald Trump and enact the policies we all care about.\" Among the field of Democratic presidential candidates, Biden has always had a high number of endorsements in competitive states like Iowa and New Hampshire, but they didn't translate into wins in either of the two states. In Iowa, Biden came in fourth and in New Hampshire he placed fifth. He came in second, behind Sanders, in the Nevada caucuses. But that changed in South Carolina, where he received the coveted endorsement of Congressman Jim Clyburn, a Democratic kingmaker in the Palmetto State. Among Democratic primary voters, 47% said Clyburn's endorsement was an important factor in their vote. Biden thanked the South Carolina congressman for helping drive him to victory in the state, saying he \"brought me back.\" The field of Democrats seeking the presidential nomination has thinned in the wake of the South Carolina primary. Billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer ended his campaign Saturday followed by Buttigieg and Klobuchar. The leaves five candidates in the race: Biden, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren. Biden warned about the ramifications of Sanders winning the nomination in an interview Monday with CBS News, during which he said a ticket led by Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, could jeopardize Democrats running for the House and Senate. \"There's an awful lot of people who are running for office who don't want to run with Bernie at the top of the ticket as a self-proclaimed socialist,\" Biden said. \"Imagine here in Texas or in North Carolina or in Georgia, the idea, if I said to you, 'This is an open test. You're running for office. Do you want a very popular, self-proclaimed socialist or a popular mainstream Democrat running at the top of the ticket?' My guess is in most states, they'd say no.\" The former vice president suggested his flurry of endorsements, including from Democrats in battleground states, stems from the realization that the success of other candidates could hinge on the eventual Democratic presidential nominee. \"It's not going to be enough just to beat Donald Trump. We have to win back the Senate, we have to keep the House,\" he said. \"Whether they're right or not, those people who are running for those offices think that Bernie was not likely to help them, but hurt them in their pursuit of their Senate or their House seat or their governor's seat.\" Bo Erickson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "New York \u2014\u00a0New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is endorsing Bernie Sanders for president, a move that puts de Blasio in a position to become a leading voice in opposition to Sanders' newest rival, Mike Bloomberg, his predecessor in leading the nation's largest city. De Blasio, an unabashed liberal who was elected in 2013, will campaign for Sanders in Nevada this weekend, the Sanders campaign said Friday in a news release. De Blasio hopes to be a significant surrogate for Sanders four years after he dithered about his presidential endorsement and, late in the primary process, backed Hillary Clinton instead of the Vermont senator, who shared far more of his ideology. \"I am standing with Bernie because he stands with working families, and always has,\" de Blasio said in the news release. \"New Yorkers know all too well the damage caused by Donald Trump's xenophobia, bigotry and recklessness, and Bernie is the candidate to take him on and take him down.\" De Blasio, whose own 2020 presidential bid ended with a whimper months before any votes were cast, could play an important role for Sanders, who now sits atop the progressive portion of the Democratic field, as the senator squares off against several more moderate choices, including Bloomberg, who led New York for the 12 years before de Blasio. De Blasio's 2013 campaign was styled as a rebuke to Bloomberg, who oversaw a city that rebuilt itself after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks to become the nation's safest biggest city and leading tourist destination. But Bloomberg's tenure also saw a sharp rise in income inequality and concern about police tactics like stop and frisk, which disproportionately affected communities of color. De Blasio, who has frosty relations with his predecessor, has repeatedly voiced his opposition to the billionaire's late presidential bid. \"This is a Democratic Party today that's getting more progressive, that wants to address the concerns of working people, that does not accept the status quo,\" de Blasio said after Bloomberg announced his candidacy. \"There's no way in the world we should nominate a billionaire who epitomizes the status quo.\" The Bloomberg campaign declined to comment Friday on the endorsement. Additionally, the strongest piece of de Blasio's political base at home has been African American voters drawn to his promises of police reform, combating income inequality and his biracial family. And the mayor aims to stress those bona fides just as the Democratic nominating process heads to far more diverse states like Nevada and South Carolina. De Blasio has long sought to play an outsize role on the national stage trumpeting progressive ideas but has struggled to raise his profile much beyond New York City. A presidential forum he sponsored ahead of the 2016 election was canceled because of a lack of interest from candidates, and his own advisers have expressed regret as to how he handled his endorsement for that campaign. Although de Blasio was far more aligned with Sanders, he also had a debt of loyalty to the Clintons; he was the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate run in New York, and the former first couple presided over the mayor's inauguration in 2013. But de Blasio sat on his choice for months, and his eventual lukewarm endorsement for Clinton led to him being banished to a secondary role at the Democratic convention and on the campaign trail.",
