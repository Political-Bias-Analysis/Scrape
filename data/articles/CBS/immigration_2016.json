            "article_content": "\u00a0By Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto  Just under half of Americans -- 46 percent -- are excited or optimistic about the presidency of Donald Trump, and just over half are either concerned (31 percent) or scared (22 percent) about what Mr. Trump will do as president. A new CBS News poll shows what the optimists are most excited about and what most worries those who are concerned or scared about Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 Thirty-six percent of Americans who are at least optimistic about a Trump presidency volunteer an improved economy or bringing back jobs as the thing they are most excited or optimistic about, by far the top choice. \u00a0Other reasons for optimism are the prospect of deporting illegal immigrants (5 percent), making America great again (4 percent), the way Mr. Trump will handle foreign policy (4 percent), bringing change to Washington, (4 percent), and getting rid of Obamacare (4 percent). For those concerned with the prospect of a Trump presidency, Mr. Trump\u2019s potential handling of foreign policy and the prospect of starting an international incident or getting the U.S. involved in a war is the top worry (22 percent), followed by his immigration policy 8 percent), his overall temperament and personality (6 percent), that he\u2019ll hurt the economy and job creation (6 percent), bigotry (6 percent), and his lack of qualifications and experience (5 percent). Amidst concerns from segments of the intelligence community about the role Russia may have played in the 2016 presidential campaign, more than a third of Americans think Donald Trump will be too friendly toward Russia when he becomes president. \u00a0Just 9 percent think he will be too hostile, while nearly half \u2013 48 percent - think his approach will be about right. \u00a0Views are largely partisan: \u00a0eight in 10 Republicans think his approach will be about right and six in 10 Democrats think he will be too friendly toward Russia. In comparison, 32 percent of Americans think Mr. Trump will be too hostile toward China, while just 9 percent think he will be too friendly. \u00a0Here again, half think his approach will be about right. Majorities are confident in Donald Trump\u2019s ability to handle some of the most important issues facing the nation: 61 percent are very or somewhat confident in how he will manage the economy, and 55 percent are confident in how he will deal with the threat of terrorism. About half are confident in his ability to make the right decisions about illegal immigration and foreign policy. Views are highly partisan; roughly nine in ten Republicans are confident in how the president-elect will manage the economy, terrorism, illegal immigration and foreign policy, while most Democrats are not confident. Americans are divided as to whether incidents of racial harassment have become more frequent since Donald Trump won the presidency \u2013 48 percent say they have, 44 percent say there isn\u2019t much difference. But four in five agree that now that he has been elected president, Mr. Trump has a responsibility to condemn incidents of racial harassment that might occur. Democrats (66 percent) are far more likely than Republicans (25 percent) to say such incidents have become more frequent. Majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents agree that now that he has been elected president, Mr. Trump has the responsibility to condemn these events. Fifty-eight percent of Americans think that the way Mr. Trump conducted his campaign has encouraged racial division; 29 percent think that has had no effect. Views are highly partisan. The poll finds mixed views of other specific qualities for the president-elect. Fifty-two percent say Mr. Trump does not share their priorities. Forty-five percent think he will make the U.S. image in the world worse, while 36 percent expect him to improve it. \u00a0There is more agreement about his leadership: six in ten think he has strong leadership qualities. \u00a0Republicans hold much more positive views of Mr. Trump than Democrats. Overall, just over a third of Americans \u2013 36 percent - say the election of Donald Trump as president makes them feel proud. \u00a0Partisanship affects views: most Republicans feel proud (70 percent), while most Democrats (87 percent) and independents (58 percent) do not. Overall opinion of Donald Trump remains more negative than positive, though fewer registered voters view him unfavorably than did so right before the election, and more are now saying they are undecided at this point. \u00a0Vice President-elect Mike Pence is viewed more favorably than unfavorably, though more than a third are undecided. After Donald Trump is sworn in as president, the Republican Party will control both the executive and legislative branches of government. Asked, in general, whether it is better to have the president and Congress from the same or different parties, Americans have a slight preference for control of both branches by the same party. But as has been the case historically, pragmatism trumps principle here: most Republicans now support same-party control, while Democrats prefer the presidency and Congress be controlled by different parties. \u00a0During Mr. Obama\u2019s second term - when Congress was under Republican control - Republicans wanted the White House and the Congress to be controlled by different parties. Majorities of Americans describe both major political parties as divided, not united. More view the Republican party as divided --partly because their own rank and file see the party that way. Democrats, despite losing the presidency and their failure to take control of Congress, are more likely to describe their political party as united than Republicans are to say that about theirs. Half of Americans now say that, compared to how they have treated other candidates, the news media has been harder in its treatment of Donald Trump. That is up from 40 percent of registered voters in June, before Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee. Republicans are especially likely to say the media has been harder on their candidate. Few Americans report having a great deal of trust and confidence in the news media to report the news fully, accurately and fairly; just 11 percent say they do. Half have not much or no confidence in the news media; that rises to 68 percent of Republicans.  President-elect Trump recently announced that the company Carrier would keep hundreds of jobs in the U.S. instead of moving them to Mexico in exchange for financial incentives. \u00a0More than two in three Americans \u2013 69 percent -- including majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents \u2013 favor a general policy that would provide tax breaks to companies that agree to keep U.S. manufacturing jobs from moving overseas. Twenty-seven percent oppose providing those tax breaks. Forty-eight percent think that trade with other countries loses more jobs for the U.S., while 29 percent think it creates jobs. Republicans have said that among the first things they will do after Donald Trump takes office next month is to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u00a0Now, 45 percent approve of the 2010 health care law, and 50 percent disapprove. Still, just one in ten think the ACA is working well and should be left as it is. Sixty-three percent think there are some good things in the law, but changes are needed, and 25 percent want the law repealed altogether. The percentage that supports repealing the law is down 10 points since January. Donald Trump\u2019s choice for head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, is skeptical that climate change is occurring. \u00a0That contrasts with the public\u2019s views: most Americans think climate change is either affecting the environment now (56 percent) or will do so in the future (23 percent). \u00a0Just 17 percent of the public thinks global warming won\u2019t have a serious impact, and 1 percent thinks it doesn\u2019t exist. \u00a0 This poll was conducted by telephone December 9-13, 2016 among a random sample of 1,259 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.  The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.  Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.  The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample and the sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

            "article_content": "BOISE, Idaho - The population of American prisons is likely to rise for the first time in nearly a decade with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s promise to detain and deport millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally and his selection of tough-on-crime Sen. Jeff Sessions to the nation\u2019s highest law enforcement post. If so, one of the prime beneficiaries would be the private companies that operate many of the nation\u2019s prisons. The stock market seems to agree. A day after the election, CoreCivic Co., formerly Corrections Corporation of America, saw the biggest percentage gain on the New York Stock Exchange with shares climbing 43 percent. Shares of Geo Group, another private prison company, also jumped 21 percent. The federal prison population had been trending down for nearly a decade when the Obama administration announced in August that it would phase out its use of some private facilities. The announcement followed a Justice Department audit saying private facilities have more safety and security problems than government-run lockups. The policy change did not cover private prisons used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, though federal officials have said they are considering phasing out private contractor immigration facilities. Trump, however, said during his campaign that the nation\u2019s prison system was a mess and voiced support for private prisons. \u201cI do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons. It seems to work a lot better,\u201d Trump told MSNBC in March, though he didn\u2019t offer any details on what that might mean for the federal prison system. Immigration and Customs Enforcement holds up to 34,000 immigrants awaiting deportation. Forty-six of the roughly 180 facilities in which ICE holds those immigrants are privately run, with about 73 percent of detainees held in the private facilities, the agency says. \u201cTrump was saying during his 100-day plan that mandatory minimums for people re-entering the country would be set at two years - that\u2019s going to require a longer-term need for beds,\u201d said Michael Kodesch, a senior associate with financial services firm Canaccord Genuity Inc. Immigration detention centers are particularly profitable for private prison companies because they command a higher rate for each inmate bed, he said. Yet what\u2019s good for investors isn\u2019t good for the country, said Bob Libal, executive director of Grassroots Leadership, a national nonprofit group that works to reduce incarceration and detention rates. \u201cThey\u2019re handing the keys to a deportation machine over to the Trump administration,\u201d Libal said. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s no reason to believe that the Trump administration won\u2019t drive that machine forward through human rights protections or due process protections people in the detention system.\u201d Sessions, Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, was among a handful of Republican senators blocking a bipartisan bill that would reduce lengthy sentences for low-level drug offenders. McLaurine Klingler, a spokeswoman for Sessions, said no one on Sessions\u2019 staff was immediately available to talk about his feelings on the DOJ\u2019s use on private prisons. CoreCivic spokesman Jonathan Burns said the company doesn\u2019t take positions on proposals, legislation or policies that would determine the basis of an individual\u2019s incarceration or detention. He said the company instead works to \u201ceducate lawmakers on the benefits of public-private partnership generally and the solutions CoreCivic provides.\u201d",

The Mexican government has publicly reminded him that Mexico will not pay for the wall. And asked about the wall, Trump transition co-chair Newt Gingrich said the wall was \u201ca great campaign device.\u201d Trump also told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that the border wall, which was one of the centerpieces of his campaign platform, could be part wall and \u201csome fencing,\u201d in accordance with what congressional Republicans have proposed. \u201cFor certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very good at this, it\u2019s called construction.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, is making his first trip Thursday to the nation\u2019s capital after his Election Night victory, meeting Thursday with President Obama and other top Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. On Wednesday, President Obama pledged to help with a smooth transfer of power, echoing\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s election night call\u00a0for Americans to unite after the divisive election. In Trump\u2019s meeting with GOP congressional leaders, given that Republicans control the House and Senate, there will likely be big-ticket items on the list, reports CBS News correspondent Major Garrett. While both the president and president-elect have been gracious since the election, it is hard to forget some of the things they said about each other during the course of the campaign.\u00a0 \u201cIf his closest advisers don\u2019t trust him to tweet, why would any of us trust him with the nuclear codes,\u201d Mr. Obama said during a Philadelphia rally. And Trump has said of the president that he \u201cis essentially incompetent,\u201d and he spent \u00a0months before and during the 2012 presidential campaign questioning whether Mr. Obama was born in the U.S. Follow along with our live-blog of his first transition meetings:\u00a0 3:14 p.m.\u00a0Trump, his wife Melania, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell paused before cameras after leaving McConnell\u2019s office. When Trump was asked about his legislative priorities, he said, \u201cWell, we have a lot.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to look very strongly at immigration.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe are going to look very strongly at healthcare,\u201d he added, \u201cand we\u2019re looking at jobs, big league jobs.\u201d 2:38: p.m. ET Pence leaves the Capitol on his own to meet with Vice President Joe Biden at the White House. 2:15 p.m. ET Trump and Pence meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the Capitol\u2019s Senate Leadership Office. 2:14 p.m. ET\u00a0A man was detained by Capitol Hill Police in front of the Capitol Hill Club, according to pool reports. The individual was yelling at people who were hanging around to see Trump, who lunched there with House Speaker Paul Ryan.\u00a0 Police reportedly told the man to quiet down but he refused, saying he had a right to yell at Trump supporters, and they started to detain him. The man appeared to cooperate, though he was still speaking as they put him in a van.\u00a0 2:01 p.m. ET House Speaker Paul Ryan appeared with Trump and vice president-elect Mike Pence in front of reporters at a conference room in the Capitol. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, sat next to her husband.\u00a0 Ryan commended Trump for \u201cone of the most impressive\u201d election victories \u201cI\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He added that he was \u201cexcited\u201d about the opportunity to work with Trump.\u00a0 \u201cI think we\u2019re going to do some absolutely spectacular things for the American people,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cWe can\u2019t get started fast enough, whether it\u2019s healthcare or immigration -- so many different things.\u201d\u00a0 Trump called the gathering a \u201cvery good meeting, a very detailed meeting,\u201d and mentioned some policies on his agenda, including lowering taxes, and making health care more affordable.\u00a0 Ryan then took the president-elect and his wife out on the House Speaker\u2019s balcony of the Capitol building to show off the view. Ryan pointed out to Trump where he will be inaugurated.\u00a0 As Trump and Pence walked by reporters, Trump said the balcony tour was \u201creally beautiful.\u201d\u00a0 1:30 p.m. ET President Obama and President-Elect Trump met alone in the Oval Office for 90 minutes, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters shortly after the two met. There was no staff in the room with Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. And their meeting, Earnest said, was \u201cat least a little less awkward than some might have expected.\u201d During the meeting, Mr. Obama talked about his upcoming trip abroad, to Greece, Germany and Peru -- his final foreign trip as president -- and he described for Mr. Trump some of the issues he expects to come up with other world leaders, Earnest said. The two spent a large part of the meeting talking about staffing and organizing the White House. \u201cThat\u2019s complicated business,\u201d Earnest said. It must be structured to deal with multiple crises simultaneously. 12:59 p.m. ET Trump flashed a thumbs-up from his car as he arrived at the Capitol Hill club for his meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Vice President-elect Mike Pence arrived earlier. 12:47 p.m. ET President Obama and president-elect Trump gave brief statements to the press in the Oval Office.\u00a0 Mr. Obama called it an \u201cexcellent meeting\u201d and said he was encouraged by the Trump transition team\u2019s interest in working with the White House.\u00a0 \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s wanting to work with my team around the many issues this great country faces,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt is important for all of us, regardless of party... to now come together, work together to deal with the many challenges we face.\u201d He added of the first lady: \u201cMichelle has had a chance to greet the incoming first lady... we want to make sure that they feel welcome...We now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed.\u201d Trump also gave remarks to the press, saying he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for his predecessor and calling him a \u201cgood man.\u201d He added that the two discussed several things -- \u201csome wonderful,\u201d and some not so wonderful. Turning to Mr. Obama, Trump said, \u201cI look forward to being with you many, many more times.\u201d The two shook hands after the meeting, which lasted more than 90 minutes. 12:35 p.m. ET Pool cameras were was ushered into the Oval Office for a photo opportunity. The president and president-elect sat in high-backed armchairs at the end of the room, as is typical for when the President speaks to world leaders. Both men spoke briefly, according to pool reports.\u00a0 12:10 p.m. ET Pence\u2019s motorcade arrives at the Capitol Hill Club, where he and Trump are scheduled to meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan.\u00a0 This afternoon, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi took a call from the vice president-elect, according to a statement by a Pelosi aide. Pelosi congratulated him on his win and the two agreed on the need to find common ground. Pelosi and Pence, who had once served in the House as a congressman from Indiana, said that they would also meet face-to-face in the following weeks.\u00a0 12:07 p.m. ET White House chief of staff Denis McDonough and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner were seen walking back from the lawn and across the Rose Garden, according to pool reports. McDonough led Kushner, who is part of Trump\u2019s transition team, up the colonnade, followed by the same group of aides who\u2019d left them on their own for the walk. They entered the White House, looked up briefly when a reporter called out \u201cDenis!\u201d but did not respond. 12:05 p.m. ET Pence\u2019s plane arrives in Washington, D.C. 11:00 a.m. ET Trump arrives to meet President Obama at the White House.\u00a0 In the afternoon, the president also welcomes the Cleveland Cavaliers to the White House to honor the team and their 2016 NBA Championship. 10:25 a.m. ET Trump\u2019s plane arrived at Washington, D.C.\u2019s Reagan National airport.\u00a0 9:45 a.m. ET Trump departed from New York\u2019s La Guardia airport to head to Washington, D.C. 9:00 a.m. ET\u00a0Here\u2019s the schedule for Donald Trump and Mike Pence\u2019s meetings:\u00a0 At 11:00 a.m. ET, President-elect Trump will meet with President Obama in the Oval Office.\u00a0 At 12:30 p.m. ET, Trump and Pence will meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, at the Capitol Hill Club.\u00a0 At 1:30 p.m. ET,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, will host the president elect and vice resident-elect for a meeting in his Capitol office today.

            "article_content": "One primary reason U.S. equities have been pushing higher and moving the Dow Jones industrials index near the 20,000 threshold -- before Wednesday\u2019s 119-point drop on Fed rate hike worries -- is a surge in big-cap technology stocks. This is a reversal of the recent trend of tech stocks lagging in the post-election rally, and it could get a boost from Wednesday\u2019s \u201ctech summit\u201d between Silicon Valley leaders and President-elect Donald Trump.  The tech stocks\u2019 move has reinvigorated the post-election market melt-up that had been led by \u201chard economy\u201d plays like industrials, materials, financials and energy stocks as investors responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plans, which amount to an aggressive fiscal stimulus of tax cuts and infrastructure spending.  Moreover, his anti-immigration stance suggested companies like Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) -- which are heavy users of H1-B skilled worker visas -- would see a clampdown on cheaper foreign labor. That would boost their expenses and weigh on profitability. Along with portfolio outflows as hedge funds and other investors sold post-election underperformers to chase new leaders, the result was a disappointing share price performance for the group over the past month (chart below).  One top topic at the Wednesday meeting between Trump and the tech CEOs was how to bring high-paying jobs back to the U.S. The industry already seems to see the writing on the wall, with IBM (IBM) CEO Ginni Rommety writing an op-ed in USA Today touting Big Blue\u2019s plans to hire 25,000 people in the U.S. and invest $1 billion over the next four years in \u201cnew collar\u201d jobs via employee vocational training.  But more than that, the meeting provided a chance to patch up relations between one of the fastest growing, most dynamic sectors of the American economy and the incoming Trump administration -- two groups that were often at odds with each other during the heated campaign season.\u00a0 While disagreements may linger on issues like net neutrality, \u201cfake news\u201d censorship and immigration, common ground on issues like corporate tax cuts and repatriation of capital being held abroad may well be found.  Just look at Apple (AAPL): Of the company\u2019s more than $215 billion cash and cash-like reserves, nearly $178 billion of it is parked overseas.\u00a0 According to Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research, cutting the tax rate on repatriated earnings held overseas from 35 percent to 10 percent could bring back upwards of $2.4 trillion in cash. This could fuel not only investment spending and hiring at home but also fresh share purchase buybacks and dividend hikes.\u00a0 All of which could be great news for not only tech sector share prices but U.S. GDP growth as well.  As for a cut in the ongoing corporate tax rate, Yardeni\u2019s researchers estimate that slicing the rate to 15 percent (from the 27.5 percent effective rate in 2015) would boost S&P 500 earnings from $132 a share in 2017 to around $155, a 17 percent increase.

The Wisconsin Republican emphasized that those with criminal records would be the focus of enforcement resources. \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re working on with respect to immigration, securing our border, enforcing our current laws,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe talked about criminal aliens. That\u2019s just enforcing laws for people who came here illegally, who came and committed violent crimes. We should enforce those laws. But really, what we\u2019re focused on is securing our border.\u201d  When Pelley noted that Mr. Trump has promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Ryan replied that \u201cconditions on the ground determine what you need in a particular area.\u201d \u201cSome areas, you might need a wall,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cSome area, you might need double fencing. My own view on this is, whatever kind of device or barrier or policy to secure the border, that\u2019s necessary to secure the border, then do it.\u201d During Mr. Trump\u2019s first televised post-election interview on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the president-elect also seemed to scale back his plans for building a border wall, saying a fence would also be acceptable across some parts of the border.  \u201cYou know, they are talking about a fence in the Republican Congress,\u201d CBS\u2019 Lesley Stahl told Mr. Trump shortly he claimed victory in the general election. \u201cWould you accept a fence? \u201cFor certain areas I would,\u201d he responded. \u201cBut certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I\u2019m very good at this, it\u2019s called construction.\u201d \u201cSo part wall, part fence?\u201d Stahl pressed. \u201cThere could be some fencing,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Ryan\u2019s interview will be broadcast on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday, Dec. 4 at 7 p.m. ET/PT.",

Now, just days after being elected the 45th president, Trump told CBS News\u2019 Lesley Stahl he has not decided whether to follow through on that particular statement. \u201cI\u2019m going to think about it,\u201d he said in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, his first sit-down interview since Election Day. \u201cUm, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on -- all of these other things that we\u2019ve been talking about.\u201d This summer, after a full investigation into Clinton\u2019s email practices while at the State Department, the FBI announced it would not be recommending charges against Clinton. Still, FBI Director James Comey said Clinton had been \u201ccareless\u201d with classified information -- which was criticism Trump and other Republicans frequently used against Clinton throughout the campaign. Last month, barely 10 days before Election Day, Comey informed Congress that the FBI was looking at new material related to the case -- but then announced last Sunday that it had not found anything to contradict its previous conclusions in the case, and said it still did not recommend any charges against Clinton. Trump told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that Clinton \u201cdid some bad things,\u201d but that ultimately the Clintons are \u201cgood people.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt them, I don\u2019t want to hurt them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re, they\u2019re good people.

            "article_content": "A small group of top Silicon Valley executives are slated to attend a technology summit next week put on by Donald Trump, according to a report by tech news site Recode. Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg are all included on the guest list for the gathering, which will convene Wednesday at Trump Tower in New York. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, and Oracle CEO Safra Catz are all expected to attend as well.  In a statement to CBS News, Catz said he would like to discuss specific policy issues with Mr. Trump.  \u201cI plan to tell the President-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,\u201d the Oracle executive said. \u201cIf he can reform the tax code, reduce regulation, and negotiate better trade deals, the U.S. technology community will be stronger and more competitive than ever.\u201d  Other companies listed, like Alphabet, Apple, and Facebook, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by CBS News.\u00a0 Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign grudge against Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (who also owns the Washington Post, a frequent punching bag of the president-elect during the election season), Recode reported that Bezos was also invited to the roundtable. Bezos is likely to accept that invitation.  The invites were reportedly extended by incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s few vocal supporters from the tech industry.\u00a0 During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump largely struggled to gain favor with the innovators in Silicon Valley, in part because of his proposed crackdown on immigration. Several executives, in contrast, worked with pro-immigration reform advocacy groups, like the technology-focused Fwd.us. But Mr. Trump has also drawn fire from Silicon Valley on other issues, like when he urged a boycott of Apple after the company said it would not unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.  \u201cBoycott Apple until such time as they give that information,\u201d Trump said a day before South Carolina\u2019s GOP primary. \u201cApple ought to give the security for that phone, OK. What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such a time as they give that security number. How do you like that? I just thought of it. Boycott Apple,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut Tim Cook is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is. But Apple should give up, they should get the security or find other people.\u201d Mr. Trump has even lumped several technology companies in with attacks against the \u201cdishonest media.\u201d\u00a0 Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!",

            "article_content": "Anyone who lived through the 1970s is likely to shudder when they hear the term \u201cstagflation.\u201d That\u2019s the dreadful combination of rising inflation, higher unemployment and a slowing economy that hampered U.S. growth in that decade. That unappetizing stew of negative trends could return under President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s economic proposals, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs\u2019 (GS) economics team. Stagflation is a possibility under what the firm describes as its \u201cadverse\u201d forecast, based on Trump\u2019s restrictive economic proposals, which include limiting free trade. With Trump\u2019s surprise win last week, economists have been scrambling to assess what his plans will mean for the near- and long-term prospects of the U.S. economy. Many economists, Goldman\u2019s among them, are developing several scenarios because of what\u2019s viewed as a high level of uncertainty about how Trump might translate his proposals -- such as a 45 percent trade tariff on Chinese imports -- into political reality.\u00a0 \u201cThe positive fiscal impulse from his tax reform and infrastructure proposals could provide a near-term boost to growth and, depending on the specifics, could have positive longer-run supply side effects,\u201d Goldman economists wrote in their report. \u201cHowever, other proposals could lead to new restrictions on foreign trade and immigration, which could have negative implications for growth, particularly over the longer term.\u201d Removing the country\u2019s estimated 8 million illegal workers would likely be negative for the U.S. economy. \u00a0Recent research from Queens College CUNY economists noted that these workers currently contribute about 3 percent of private sector GDP, or about $5 trillion over a decade.\u00a0 Given the uncertainty over how Trump\u2019s campaign promises will translate into economic policy, the Goldman team ran through three scenarios.\u00a0 The first considers what Goldman calls Trump\u2019s \u201cfull\u201d case, assuming that everything he has promised will be enacted, while the \u201cbenign projection\u201d assumes only his fiscal policies are carried out, such as tax reform. The last forecast -- its \u201cadverse\u201d scenario -- includes Trump\u2019s more restrictive trade and immigration policies, as well as a more hawkish Federal Reserve.\u00a0 Stagflation would be the outcome in the adverse scenario, Goldman noted. Real GDP growth would decline by about 0.8 percentage points in 2018 and 2019, while inflation would rise to 2.3 percent in 2019. Unemployment would rise to 5.3 percent, roughly its level during early 2008 at the start of the recession.\u00a0 Still, that\u2019s a far cry from the stagflation that crushed many American households in the 1970s, when inflation rose as high as 12 percent and unemployment was above 7 percent. Yet it would represent a setback from the current economic trends of lower unemployment and a stable inflation rate.\u00a0 Goldman isn\u2019t alone in assessing different economic scenarios under Trump. Oxford Economics on Monday published a report with a similar approach, providing baseline, upside and downside scenarios. Oxford\u2019s downside view sees the economy shrinking by 5 percent by 2020 and losing 4 million jobs.\u00a0 \u201cOur downside scenario assumes that, after a brief honeymoon period, President Trump reverts to his highly protectionist and isolationist stance,\u201d wrote Gregory Daco, head of U.S. macroeconomics, in the Oxford report. \u201cHis refusal to negotiate with Congress means Republicans refuse any increase in the deficit. Global aversion to the U.S. combines with heightened domestic policy uncertainty.\u201d The president has the executive power to cancel trade agreements (such as NAFTA), impose tariffs and nix some business regulations, but many of Trump\u2019s proposals would need the green light from Congress, such as repealing the Affordable Care Act and on fiscal policies, Daco added.\u00a0 \u201cAnd while Republicans hold a majority in Congress, there is no guarantee that Mr. Trump would find common ground in negotiations with members of his own party,\u201d he noted. \u201cTraditionally, elections have reduced political and policy uncertainty, but in this case the uncertainty remains unusually elevated.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK -- Immigrants, their advocates and others opposing a Donald Trump presidency continued to protest Sunday, speaking out against the president-elect\u2019s support of deportation and other measures. Organizers in Manhattan carried signs in English and Spanish saying things like \u201cHate won\u2019t make us great,\u201d and chanted, \u201cWe are here to stay.\u201d As the protests continued across the country,President-elect Trumptold \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl about his mass deportation plans and urged Americans of all stripes to give him a chance after a tumultuous campaign that saw vitriol largely replace serious debate over policy. He also urged those people reportedly harassing Muslims and immigrant groups to \u201cstop it.\u201d\u00a0 More than 1,000 people joined the march in New York City that started mid-afternoon and extended into the evening.  The area surrounding the president-elect\u2019s Midtown home had become like a fortress, with Secret Service agents and NYPD \u00a0officers going to extremes to protect the future president, CBS New York reported. It was the latest in days of demonstrations across the country, and even throughout the world. Protests were held Sunday in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia and more cities. Several hundred protesters Sunday marched around Philadelphia\u2019s City Hall and then down Market Street to Independence Mall, carrying signs and chanting \u201cDonald Trump has got to go!\u201d and \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d In Los Angeles, a few hundred people gathered outside CNN\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters, and in San Francisco, hundreds of people, including many families with children, marched from Golden Gate Park to Ocean Beach chanting \u201cLove trumps hate!\u201d By nightfall, a few hundred people marched across downtown San Francisco\u2019s main street, blocking traffic at an intersection when they held a sit-down protest. Elsewhere in California, about 800 people marched through Sacramento and thousands others formed a human chain around the nearly 3.5-mile perimeter of Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt. Rallies in Oakland have at times become unruly, but those who came to the lake held hands and chanted, \u201cWe reject the president-elect.\u201d In Oregon, protesters marched through Portland again Sunday night following a gathering of anti-Trump demonstrators earlier in the evening. Television footage showed dozens of chanting but peaceful marchers moving through downtown streets. Sunday night\u2019s protest came after police said they arrested 71 people late Saturday and early Sunday during downtown protests. Demonstrations also took place internationally. On Saturday, a group of Mexicans at statue representing independence in Mexico City expressed their concerns about a possible wave of deportations. One school teacher said it would add to the \u201cunrest\u201d that\u2019s already in Mexico. About 300 people protested Trump\u2019s election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy near the landmark Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Mostly, the demonstrations were peaceful. However, in Portland, Oregon, a man was shot and wounded Saturday morning during a confrontation. Police arrested two teenagers in the shooting.",

            "article_content": "Silicon Valley may be the mecca of tech innovation, but it is struggling to adapt to the electoral earthquake that propelled Donald Trump, a candidate who drew near-universal scorn from tech power players, to the White House. Venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and tech employees are bracing for the switch from a president who openly admired the tech industry, to one who -- on the campaign trail, at least -- viewed its ascendancy with skepticism. That\u2019s despite the possibility that Trump may go down in history as one of the savviest users of social media (Twitter, in particular) on the planet. A key point of conflict: Silicon Valley\u2019s innovations tend to eliminate blue-collar American jobs, which Trump has promised to restore. Many of the Valley\u2019s most promising projects in the pipeline, including automated vehicles, could inflict even more carnage, although tech supporters argue that the resulting efficiency gains would provide a big boost to the economy. The industry also thrives on immigration, and Trump has promised a crackdown on that.\u00a0 Meantime, the tech sector\u2019s financial lifeblood comes from private-equity and venture-capital investors, who bank on the carried-interest tax loophole, which Trump (in agreement with Hillary Clinton) has promised to eliminate. With this tax break, the investors pay a lower rate on their profits than than the IRS charges for ordinary income. Worry among Valley thought leaders runs so deep that after Trump\u2019s triumph, several folks quickly signed on to a quixotic movement launched by Shervin Pishevar, co-founder of high-speed train startup Hyperloop One and an investor in the car service Uber, to push for California to become an independent country. \u201cIt\u2019s the most patriotic thing we can do,\u201d Pishevar wrote on Twitter. \u201cCountry is at serious crossroads. We can reenter the union after California becomes a nation.\u201d He later clarified his tweet to say he doesn\u2019t want California to secede, but rather to \u201cfight against a centralized Federal gov that\u2019s amassed too much power.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly showed animosity toward the tech industry. He sided with the FBI in a high-profile battle with Apple (AAPL) over whether the tech giant should be forced to build a backdoor to access data on its iPhones, allowing government snooping on customers.\u00a0 He also implied he would force hardware companies like Apple to bring back their offshore-based manufacturing operations to the U.S. Such a move would put them in a tough competitive position against foreign rivals because production costs are lower in many overseas locations. Trump also pledged to allow fewer foreign employees to work in the U.S. on H1B visas, which grant temporary status here for those with specialities, such as in technology. And his rhetoric on Muslim and Latino immigrants was seen as an affront to the tech industry\u2019s stated commitment to diversity and inclusion.\u00a0 Not helping matters: The president-elect recently added billionaire investor and Paypal founder Peter Thiel, who went from quirky insider to Valley outcast after embracing Trump\u2019s campaign, to the presidential transition team. \u00a0 The tech industry is not alone in fearing a Trump presidency: The political novice is a virtual blank slate in terms of policy, which has disconcerted executives in areas ranging from finance to health care. Still, it\u2019s entirely possible the prolific Twitter user (who reportedly does not use email or even a computer) will be more of a supporter of the tech industry than his campaign suggests. Stock indexes rallied to new highs this past week (although tech shares sat out much of the gains), as relieved investors bid up shares amid more measured remarks from the incoming president. Trump struck a conciliatory tone in his acceptance speech and signaled his first priority as president will be investing tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure. The tone was a far cry from the divisive language he deployed during his campaign. Tech leaders in the Valley took to Twitter, naturally, to lament -- as well as offer hope -- to their frustrated followers. \u201cThis is a bad beat for the U.S. But tomorrow the sun will come up and we\u2019ll get on with figuring it out. Be decent, be proud. Work hard. Hope,\u201d wrote John Lilly, a venture capitalist and former chief executive officer of Mozilla, the open-source software firm \u201cIt\u2019s two steps forward, one step back. This is a step back. Next two are forward,\u201d said Stewart Butterfield, CEO of Slack, the instant messaging company. \u201cSo many disastrous ideas have been surfaced throughout this election. We must now do everything we can to ensure America is for everyone,\u201d said Aaron Levie, CEO of cloud storage provider Box (BOX) . Added AOL co-founder Steve Case, quoting Winston Churchill: \u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump is planning another day of transition talks. He released a short video on YouTube late Monday, laying out priorities for the start of his term. He promised to focus on creating jobs, but he did not mention repealing Obamacare or building a wall on the Mexican border, two of his most popular campaign promises. \u201cI\u2019ve asked my transition team to develop a list of executive actions we can take on day one to restore our laws and bring back our jobs. It\u2019s about time,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the video.\u00a0 It outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office including withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, loosening restrictions on energy production and cutting regulations. He also promised a hard look at the visa program, reports CBS News correspondent Chip Reid. \u201cOn immigration, I will direct the Department of Labor to investigate all abuses of visa programs that undercut the American worker,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump will head to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for the holiday weekend, but before that it appears he will continue to prepare for his White House transition behind closed doors while the media anxiously watches and waits. Mr. Trump has largely sidestepped the media since winning the election two weeks ago. In 2008, then-President-elect Obama held a press conference three days after his victory. \u201cThe man works 18 hours a day, interviewing people, taking calls from across the world. And he will have a press conference in due course,\u201d top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said. Also passing through the skyscraper\u2019s lobby were a parade of job-seekers. Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, a retired member of the Army National Guard, said he should be secretary of Veterans Affairs.  \u201cI think I\u2019m the best person, but there are some tremendous people out there,\u201d Brown said.  Democratic Congresswoman and Iraq War veteran Tulsi Gabbard was invited by Mr. Trump to discuss foreign policy in Syria. She later wrote in a statement: \u201cI never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives.\u201d Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a potential pick for secretary of homeland security, was seen holding a document titled \u201cStrategic Plan for First 365 Days.\u201d   A leading critic of illegal immigration, his plan calls for adding \u201cextreme vetting questions for high-risk aliens\u201d and \u201creducing the intake of Syrian refugees to zero.\u201d  Mr. Trump has called his victory the American version of Brexit, a historic vote by British citizens to withdraw from the European Union. On Twitter Monday night, the president-elect wrote that Nigel Farage, one of Brexit\u2019s leaders, would make a great ambassador to the U.S. Britain\u2019s prime minister quickly debunked the suggestion, saying the country already has an excellent U.S. ambassador.",

            "article_content": "In the final sprint to Election Day, Hillary Clinton is painting a grim picture of what a Donald Trump presidency would mean for Americans. \u201cImagine it is January 20, 2017,\u201d Clinton urged supporters gathered at Arizona State University in Tempe Wednesday. \u201cAnd imagine if it\u2019s Donald Trump standing in front of the Capitol.\u201d  She\u2019s reminding voters of the more controversial things he\u2019s said about specific groups of Americans. \u201cImagine he is taking the oath of office,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then imagine what it will be like to have him in the Oval Office making the decisions that affect your lives and your futures. Imagine having a president who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults Latinos, African Americans Muslims, POWs, who pits people against each other instead of pulling us together.\u201d  A Trump presidency, she argues, would be a setback for women and girls, Clinton is telling audiences. She invoked Carly Fiorina, one of Trump\u2019s Republican\u00a0primary opponents,\u00a0in her portrayal of him as a dangerous example for American children.  \u201cJust think about what happens if he were to win to women and girls,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt would mean that our girls would grow up with a president who proudly and loudly ranks women by their looks including the only woman running in the Republican primary.\u201d  \u201cRemember what he said about Carly Fiorina?\u201d she asked. \u201cA distinguished women with a tremendous record of accomplishment. Trump said nobody will vote for her -- look at her face.\u201d For immigrants, Clinton imagines a difficult future under Trump, who, she posits, would appoint the tough-on-immigration Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio to lead the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.  \u201cHis top adviser on immigration is Sheriff Joe Arpaio,\u201d Clinton said in Arizona, a state with a large Hispanic population. \u201cJust last week, Sheriff Arpaio was officially charged with criminal contempt of court because he refused to stop racially profiling Latinos. Now imagine Donald Trump appointing the sheriff our next secretary of Homeland Security to oversee the massive deportation force.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s swing through Arizona is an indication of the campaign\u2019s thinking when it comes to the electoral map. The state, deeply red, has only elected one Democrat in the last sixty or so years: her husband, Bill Clinton. But as the race tightens nationally, polls show Clinton is now within striking distance of the Republican nominee in Arizona. According to this weekend\u2019s CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, Trump leads by just two points, 44 percent to Clinton\u2019s 42 percent. Ending on a more hopeful note, Clinton told Tempe rally-goers, numbering about 15,000: \u201cAs the political pundits like to say, this state is in play for the first time in years...We have a real chance to turn this state blue again.\u201d",

            "article_content": "During his presidential campaign Donald Trump repeatedly boasted that if he were to win the White House, it would be an extension of the same sentiments that led to the United Kingdom\u2019s surprise vote to leave the European Union this June. (\u201cIt will be called Brexit-plus-plus-plus,\u201d he said on Monday.) Trump stunned Washington\u2014and the world\u2014Tuesday night when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton and was elected as the country\u2019s 45th president. But the same sentiments and discontent that fueled his rise are at play across the world, including in several countries slated to hold elections in the coming months.  The brand of right-wing populism and economic nationalism Trump and his supporters championed is alive and well in more places than one around the world, and citizens of those countries no doubt watched Tuesday\u2019s results roll in with interest. With that in mind, here is a guide to where else in the world to watch for a Trump-like phenomenon at the ballot box: Austria, the country of just under 9 million people in central Europe, could be just weeks away from electing the first far-right head of state in the European Union. Norbert Hofer, head of the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, lost the May runoff election by less than one\u00a0percent of the vote. However the results of that vote were annulled by a federal court\u2014prompting the re-vote, which will take place on Dec. 4.  Hofer has campaigned on a platform of \u201cputting Austria first,\u201d calling for a referendum on the country\u2019s membership in the European Union. And as Europe reels from the Syrian refugee crisis, Hofer has said Islam \u201chas no place in Austria.\u201d Opinion polling in late October and early November gives Hofer a slim but consistent lead over his opponent, independent candidate Alexander Van der Bellen. In Austria, the presidency is a largely ceremonial role. But if elected, Hofer\u2019s rise could portend similar movements across Europe\u2014and make Austria\u2019s neighbors, particularly Germany, nervous for their own elections in less than a year. The Netherlands, too, is facing the possibility that a far-right party could lead its government after the country\u2019s general elections next March: a man by the name of Geert Wilders. (Wilders, with his helmet of blonde hair, has even drawn visual comparisons with Trump.)  Wilders, who leads the country\u2019s Freedom Party, has risen to prominence on a platform of halting what he calls the \u201cIslamization of the Netherlands.\u201d He has proposed halting all construction of new mosques, banning the Quran from the country and ending Muslim immigration. Like other right-wing populist movements across Europe, Wilders\u2019 Freedom Party is also anti-European Union. In the Dutch general election of 2012, Wilders and his Freedom Party came in first, edging out the Labour Party to win a plurality of seats in the parliament. Recent polls in the race put the Freedom Party either slightly ahead or tied for first in the parliament next spring.  Speaking at an event in Cleveland for the Republican National Convention this summer, where he traveled to show his support for Trump, Wilders said he expects to become the next prime minister if the Freedom Party comes in first place in March. It\u2019s fairly telling that one of the first world political figures to congratulate Trump on his victory early Wednesday morning was Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right French National Front party.  \u201cToday, the United States,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cTomorrow, France. Bravo!\u201d Le Pen is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, the far-right leader who reached the second round of France\u2019s 2002 presidential election (only to be solidly defeated by Jacques Chirac). And she has a real shot at being one of the final two candidates in France\u2019s 2017 presidential election. France votes in two stages: the first round on April 23 includes all parties, then the top two vote-getters advance to the second-round election on May 7. Because current French president Francois Hollande is hugely unpopular, there is a good chance Le Pen could edge him out to become one of the two candidates in the second round of voting.  In recent polls, Le Pen consistently comes in first or second along with a Republican candidate, either Alain Jupp\u00e9 or former President Nicolas Sarkozy. (The Republican primary will be held this Nov. 20 and 27.)  It\u2019s highly unlikely Le Pen could do what her father couldn\u2019t and actually win the presidency in the second round: in one-on-one polling simulations between Le Pen and Jupp\u00e9 or Le Pen and Sarkozy, she loses by double digits. But she will undoubtedly be one of the biggest players in French politics next year. The rise of Germany\u2019s anti-immigrant party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) is one of the best-covered right-wing populist movements in the world right now, after Brexit and Trump\u2014and AfD is poised to win seats in the Bundestag, Germany\u2019s national parliament, when the country votes in its federal elections next fall. The party, which launched in 2013 as a party for Euro-skeptics, won 4.7 percent in the 2013 German federal elections\u2014just shy of the 5 percent threshold for receiving seats in the Bundestag. But as German Chancellor Angela Merkel directed Germany to accept large numbers of Syrian refugees, AfD rebranded itself as an anti-immigrant party and capitalized on the growing fear and negative sentiment toward migrants.  AfD has already posted some victories in state elections around Germany, most notably in Saxony-Anhalt (where it came in second with 24.2 percent of the vote), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (where it came in second with 20.8 percent) and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (where it placed third with 15.1 percent). Even in Berlin, which is a stronghold for the center-left Social Democrats, AfD won 14.2 percent of the vote in this fall\u2019s state elections. To be clear, it\u2019s incredibly unlikely that AfD would ever come in first in Germany\u2019s federal elections, slated for next September or October. Merkel\u2019s party, the center-right Christian Democrats, has a large majority in the Bundestag; assuming Merkel chooses to run again next year, she is the favorite to win a fourth term in office. But AfD\u2019s rise has concerned longtime politicians and party operatives in Berlin, who will likely have to contend with an AfD that has actual seats in parliament.\u00a0 Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump has named generals to his Cabinet. He\u2019s chosen business leaders and Wall Street executives.  He\u2019s also named a number of people who currently hold elected office: including one U.S. senator, Jeff Sessions; House members Tom Price, and Mike Pompeo; and two governors, Nikki Haley of South Carolina and Terry Branstad of Iowa.  All of Mr. Trump\u2019s high-level Cabinet nominees will have to be confirmed by the U.S. senate before they can give up their current jobs, but once that happens, someone will have to fill the vacancy that\u2019s left. The rules are different for every position, and many of them differ by state as well: some will automatically be succeeded by other elected officials, while others will have their replacements appointed by their state\u2019s governor or elected in a special election. Here\u2019s a look at which Cabinet nominees currently hold elected office, and what happens to their jobs when they join the administration: Sessions, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, is the junior senator from Alabama.  If Sessions is confirmed, Alabama state election laws require a special election be held to fill the seat. Governor Robert Bentley, a Republican, can both appoint someone to fill the seat in the meantime and set the date of the special election. Bentley has asked the state Republican Party\u2019s executive committee to send him some suggestions, and Bentley will go from there. Though Sessions will need to be confirmed before a successor can be named, there are already plenty of Alabama Republicans interested in the seat.  Among those who have said they are interested, or would accept the job if it were offered, are: Attorney General Luther Strange; U.S. Reps. Robert Aderholt, Mo Brooks, Martha Roby and Mike Rogers; state Sens. Dick Brewbaker, Del Marsh, Arthur Orr, Trip Pittman and Cam Ward; and Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs Director Jim Byard Jr. One Alabama congressman, Bradley Byrne, said he is not interested in the seat and would like to remain in the House. Thus far, Mr. Trump has selected two members of the House for Cabinet-level positions: Georgia Rep. Tom Price for health and human services secretary, and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo for director of the CIA. According to the U.S. Constitution, vacancies in the U.S. House must be filled by election. If the vacancy happens during the first session of Congress -- as these would -- the seats would be filled by special election in each state, on dates to be determined. While it\u2019s again a bit early to say exactly who will run in either of these races, a few local pols are expressing tentative interest. In Georgia, Price\u2019s wife, state Rep. Betty Price, could be a contender to replace him in the House. Other names being mentioned there include former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel; state House Speaker Pro Tempore Jan Jones; state Sens. Brandon Beach and Judson Hill; state Rep. Chuck Martin; immigration lawyer Charles Kuck; and former political fundraiser Cade Joiner, among others. And in Kansas, Trump adviser Alan Cobb, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s national coalitions director and works for the transition team, has expressed interest in Pompeo\u2019s seat. Mr. Trump has selected two governors for Cabinet and appointed positions: Nikki Haley, the governor of South Carolina, will be his representative to the United Nations, while Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad is Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for U.S. ambassador to China. The process is similar and pretty straightforward in both states: governors are replaced by their lieutenant governors. In Iowa, that\u2019s Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds -- who incidentally would become the first female governor in the state\u2019s history. (Iowa is one of twenty-three states that has never had a female governor.) In South Carolina, Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster would step up and become governor if Haley is confirmed for the UN post. However, there\u2019s a bit of drama about what happens to McMaster\u2019s position as lieutenant governor if he fills Haley\u2019s job.  The state constitution says the President Pro-Tempore of the state Senate would become lieutenant governor if the sitting lieutenant governor vacates the job -- but the man who currently holds that position, Hugh Leatherman, has refused to become lieutenant governor.  Making it even more complicated is the fact that South Carolina\u2019s state legislature passed a law in 2014 to make some changes to the electoral and political system -- one of which allows the governor to immediately fill a vacancy in the lieutenant governor\u2019s office. That rule, however, is not slated to take effect until after the 2018 midterm elections. State legislators have asked South Carolina\u2019s Supreme Court to clarify whether McMaster would be allowed to appoint his replacement in this case, and to help determine what happens if the person who\u2019s supposed to be elevated to the job refuses it. Mr. Trump named Pruitt to be his next head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in early December.  Should Pruitt be confirmed to the post, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin will choose his replacement. That person would serve in the role for almost two years, since the next election isn\u2019t until fall 2018. Several potential names have come up for the post, according to The Oklahoman, including Oklahoma Secretary of State Mike Hunter, former attorney general candidate Ryan Leonard and A.J. Ferate, the general counsel for the Oklahoma Republican Party. All three have expressed interest in the job, or said they\u2019d be open to discussing it.

            "article_content": "PARIS, France -- French Prime Minister Manuel Valls stepped down Tuesday to focus on running for president in next year\u2019s election and was replaced by Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, a man who embodies the fight against Islamic extremism. Valls resigned a day after announcing his candidacy in the wake of President Francois Hollande\u2019s decision not to run for a second term last week. Valls hopes to unite Socialists and give the left a chance to stay at the Elysee Palace despite current opinion polls suggesting the second round of the election could pit Marine Le Pen, the leader of thefar-right National Front, against conservative Francois Fillon. The 53-year-old Cazeneuve is a close ally of Hollande and became a popular figure in French politics as the champion of measures tackling extremism in his interior minister role. Cazeneuve was appointed interior minister in 2014 and had to supervise the response to a series of attacks that have claimed more than 200 lives since January 2015. In total, he championed three counterterrorism laws and one intelligence law. He has also been in charge of implementing France\u2019s state of emergency following the Paris attacks that killed 130 people. After a brief meeting with Valls at the Elysee, Hollande posted a message on Twitter announcing Cazeneuve\u2019s appointment, which was also confirmed by the presidential palace press office. A leading yet divisive figure of the Socialist party, Valls is known for his outspoken, authoritarian style and his tough views on immigration and security. Valls is the top contender in the primary next month for Socialist candidates and their allies before France\u2019s two-part presidential election in April and May. But he will face tough competition from fellow Socialists. Valls has been harshly criticized by members of his own party after championing tough labor reforms and endorsing a controversial ban last summer on the Islamic \u201cburkini\u201d swimsuit. Cazeneuve was the mayor of the northern city of Cherbourg-Octeville for more than a decade before being appointed to government minister positions since 2012. Widely regarded as a hard worker, Cazeneuve was Hollande\u2019s spokesman during the president\u2019s winning campaign in 2012 and the two enjoy a trusting relationship.",

            "article_content": "BERLIN - German news agency dpa says Angela Merkel will seek a fourth term as Germany\u2019s chancellor in general elections next year. Dpa, citing sources at the Berlin headquarters of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrat party, reported Sunday that she would seek re-election. If Merkel wins in 2017 and serves the entire four-year term, she would match her one-time mentor Helmut Kohl\u2019s post-war record of 16 years in office. The 62-year-old became Germany\u2019s first female head of government in 2005. She also is the first leader of a reunited Germany to have grown up under communism in the former East Germany. Merkel is widely seen as a stabilizing force in Europe amid the refugee crisis, Britain voting to leave the European Union., and the election of Donald Trump. In response to the election of Mr. Trump, Merkel penned an op-ed with President Obama.\u00a0 \u201cToday we find ourselves at a crossroads\u2014the future is upon us, and we will never return to a pre-globalization economy. Germans and Americans we must seize the opportunity to shape globalization based on our values and our ideas. We owe it to our industries and our peoples\u2014indeed, to the global community\u2014to broaden and deepen our cooperation,\u201d the two leaders wrote in a joint op-ed in the German daily Wirtschaftswoche. They wrote that both the U.S. and Germany work hard to ensure international law and norms are respected around the world and they underscored their commitments to NATO. During his presidential campaign, Trump was critical of the German leader\u2019s decision to open Germany\u2019s borders to let in hundreds of thousands of refugees. Over the summer he said, \u201cHillary Clinton wants to be America\u2019s Angela Merkel, and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany.\u201d But in September,\u00a0he praised the German leader and said he admires her.",

Earlier, investors had appeared persuaded that Hillary Clinton, seen as a more stable choice, would prevail. At one point, Dow futures plunged more than 4 percent and Japan\u2019s major index nosedived more than 6.1 percent, its largest drop in years. The Mexican peso likewise tumbled and investors looking for safe assets bid up the price of gold. \u00a0Futures tied to the broader S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 fell more than 5 percent around midnight. Trading in S&P and Nasdaq futures was briefly paused early Wednesday, CNBC reported. That\u2019s seen as a sign that the New York Stock Exchange could activate its circuit breakers sometime after U.S. markets open Wednesday. The circuit breakers \u2013 mandatory \u201ctime outs\u201d for Wall Street traders \u2013 kick in when the S&P500 plunges 7 percent from the previous day\u2019s close, with additional breaks for 13 percent and 20 percent drops. \u201cRight now, the markets are heading for the hills, but we\u2019ll see,\u201d Robert Tipp, chief investments strategist for global bonds and foreign exchange at Prudential Fixed Income told CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s a function of fear as much as fact.\u201d During the campaign, Trump threatened to rip up trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. He pledged to greatly restrict immigration to the U.S and to build a wall along the United States\u2019 southern border and force Mexico to pay for it.\u00a0 On news of his victory the Mexican peso\u2019s value tumbled 13 percent, leaving the currency above the 20 peso per dollar mark for the first time since 1994. But the lack of clear policy details has left many worldwide uneasy over the future direction of the U.S. economy. Share prices began tumbling as soon as Trump first gained the lead in the electoral vote count.\u00a0 By the time Hillary Clinton called Trump to concede, financial markets appeared to have steadied somewhat, but analysts predicted days of turmoil.\u00a0 \u201cThis is very much a step into the unknown because we simply can\u2019t know what type of President Trump will be,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist with Capital Economics, in a note. \u201cWill he be the demagogue from the campaign trail who threatened to lock up his political opponents, punish the media, build border walls and start a global trade war? Or is he capable of becoming a statesmanlike figure who leads in a more measured manner?\u201d Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index dropped 4.4 percent to 16,410.55 and the S&P ASX/200 in Australia slipped 0.2 percent to 5,249.40. South Korea\u2019s Kospi skidded 0.6 percent to 1,991.11 and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng tumbled 1.4 percent to 22,582.11. The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.2 percent to 3,142.94. Benchmarks were higher in Malaysia and Indonesia but fell in Taiwan and Singapore. \u201cRightly or wrongly, markets are going to be concerned about a Trump victory, particularly given the potential consequences for world trade and its impact on many large companies in the U.S. stock market,\u201d said Ric Spooner, chief analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, before the results were clear.\u00a0 \u201cLike Brexit, the rally over the last two days increases the downside potential if Donald Trump does win the election,\u201d Spooner added, referring to Britain\u2019s unexpected vote to leave the European Union that shook world markets. Trump is \u201cperforming much better than the market anticipated,\u201d TD Securities analysts said in a note. In the weeks leading up to the election, market analysts had widely predicted a Clinton win. Economic forecasters also said a shock win by Trump would trigger a sell-off in equities, rise in bond yields and other moves by investors aimed at reducing their exposure to market risks.\u00a0 \u201cGlobal markets are being shaken up. You can hear early alarm bells ringing,\u201d said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group. Trump\u2019s strong performance at the polls also has financial markets reassessing the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in December, as most investors have expected.",

            "article_content": "With\u00a0less than a week to go before Election Day, Hillary Clinton still appears to have a small but steady lead over Donald Trump in several crucial battleground states.\u00a0 The presidential race is, however, tightening in Pennsylvania, where 48 percent of likely Keystone State voters say their will cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton, compared to 44 percent who say they will vote for Donald Trump, according to a Monmouth University Poll released Wednesday. The poll indicates that Clinton\u2019s lead has shrunk since the summer, when another Monmouth University poll showed her leading her Republican rival by double-digits.  \u201cClinton is still in the lead, but the race has tightened in the past four weeks,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said. \u201cIt looks like this shift was in the works even before Friday\u2019s FBI bombshell, which has made only a small contribution to this overall narrowing.\u201d In fact, only four percent of registered Pennsylvania voters say the FBI\u2019s recent news caused them to change their minds about the candidate they will support.  Trump, however, regained some support among white voters, particularly among white women, despite the nearly-month long spotlight on allegations of him engaging in lewd behavior with women. When it comes to non-white voters, however, Clinton dwarfs Trump, 83 percent to 9 percent.\u00a0 Clinton continues to dominate in areas that have historically predicted the winner of the statewide race. In Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs, the former secretary of state leads Trump by a 62 to 29 percent margin. Most of Trump\u2019s overall improvement in Pennsylvania, however, is attributed to his gains in western portion of the state, where he has a 16 point lead over Clinton.  And in an election that has seen record low favorability and approval ratings, Clinton\u2019s positive numbers have declined since last month while Trump\u2019s has ticked up. Monmouth University contacted 403 Pennsylvania residents via telephone from October 29 to November 1. The poll has a margin of error of 4.9 percent.  A similar poll released by CNN and ORC International showed that Clinton leads Trump by the same margin--4 percent--among likely Keystone State voters. When it comes to important issues, the poll says, voters have more faith in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to handle foreign policy, terrorism, health care and trade with other countries than her Republican counterpart.\u00a0 Voters, however, believe that Trump would approach economy-related issues more appropriately. What\u2019s more, the poll revealed, voters rate Clinton and Trump equally when it comes to immigration-related issues.  The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted between October 27 and November 1. It has a three point margin of error.  Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, Clinton leads Trump by six points--46 to 40 percent -- according to the final Marquette Law School poll of the race. And among early voters, Clinton receives 64 percent to 25 percent for Trump.\u00a0 On Tuesday, the Wisconsin Elections Commission reported that more than 518,000 early ballots have been cast, which would have made up 16.9 percent of 2012\u2019s presidential turnout.  The poll was conducted between October 26 and October 31, and overlapped with the FBI\u2019s unexpected announcement that it would review \u201cpertinent\u201d emails relating the probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. The news, however, didn\u2019t appear to sway voters. Clinton\u2019s lead over Trump largely remained what it was in the previous Marquette poll.  The Marquette Law School poll has a margin of error of 3.3 points, and surveyed 1,401 registered voters. Julia Boccagno is a digital journalist for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- Appearing jovial and relaxed, President-elect Donald Trump plunged back into election politics Friday, a full month after he won the presidency, thanking Michigan voters and prodding Louisiana Republicans to turn out for Saturday\u2019s Senate runoff election.  Mr. Trump regaled supporters in Grand Rapids with a lengthy recitation of his victories in a string of battleground states, including Michigan, which had not previously backed a Republican presidential candidate since 1988.  \u201cThey forgot about you people,\u201d Mr. Trump said of his Democratic opponents. \u201cIn four years they\u2019re not going to forget. But it\u2019s not going to work because you\u2019re not going to forget.\u201d  Several protesters were removed from his rally at DeltaPlex Arena, prompting the president-elect to declare at one point, \u201cGet \u2018em out of here.\u201d  Mr. Trump introduced Betsy DeVos, his choice for education secretary, who hails from West Michigan, and announced that Andrew Liveris, the chief executive of Dow Chemical, would lead a national manufacturing council. Liveris told the audience that Dow would soon bring a new research-and-development center to Michigan.  In Louisiana, the incoming president addressed a large crowd at an airport hangar, and at one point tossed his trademark \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat to a supporter. He noted that he\u2019d been named Time\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d and asked the crowd if the magazine should go back to its former \u201cMan of the Year.\u201d  Gauging the boisterous response, he declared the answer was yes.  Mr. Trump campaigned for Republican John Kennedy, the state treasurer who faces off Saturday against Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, a Democrat, for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. David Vitter. Neither won a majority in the November primary, leading to the runoff. Polls have shown Kennedy with a comfortable lead.  While candidate Mr. Trump was often at odds with the establishment wing of his party, the incoming president has been broadly supported by GOP leaders since the election. And he is trying to consolidate any lingering factions, most immediately in Louisiana, where a victory by Kennedy would cement the party\u2019s four-seat advantage in the new Senate.  \u201cWe need John in Washington,\u201d Mr. Trump said, speaking in front of a lectern that urged voters to \u201cGeaux Vote. Vote GOP.\u201d Trump said he needed Kennedy to help him enact his agenda.  In private, people close to Mr. Trump said he was expected to name yet another Goldman Sachs executive to his White House team. The president-elect\u2019s National Economic Council is to be led by Gary Cohn, president and chief operating officer of the Wall Street bank, which Mr. Trump repeatedly complained during the election campaign would control Hillary Clinton if she won.  Washington state Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the GOP House leadership team, emerged as a leading candidate to head the Interior Department, according to a person involved in the transition.  Major decisions remain for Mr. Trump, most importantly his choice for secretary of state. The deliberations have become a source of tension within his transition team, with chief of staff Reince Priebus said to be backing Mitt Romney while other advisers oppose the idea of selecting the 2012 GOP nominee, given his fierce criticism of Mr. Trump during the campaign.  Mr. Trump announced that Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who was an early favorite, was no longer under consideration.  On a busy Friday, Mr. Trump also spoke by telephone with Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who broke with protocol during the campaign to publicly endorse Hillary Clinton and said afterward she would not maintain \u201ca diplomatic silence in the face of attitudes of racism, sexism, misogyny or intolerance of any kind.\u201d  Sturgeon\u2019s office said she used Friday\u2019s call to emphasize the \u201cvalues Scotland and the United States share.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team described the conversation as a \u201cshort congratulatory call.\u201d  Mr. Trump brimmed with optimism during his two rallies, eager to begin implementing his agenda.  Come January, Mr. Trump told the crowd in Michigan: \u201cThe American people will be in charge. Your voice, your desires, your hopes, your aspirations, you will never again fall on deaf ears.\u201d  He rattled through some of the major themes of his campaign, vowing to renegotiate faulty trade deals, repair roads and bridges and \u201cbuild a wall\u201d to guard against unlawful immigration.  \u201cWe have people coming into our country by the thousands, thousands and thousands of people and now I don\u2019t have to campaign so I don\u2019t have to say Hillary\u2019s going to increase it by 550 percent,\u201d Mr. Trump said in Baton Rouge. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have to say it anymore. Isn\u2019t it nice?\u201d  Mr. Trump\u2019s day also included a meeting at his New York City tower with House Speaker Paul Ryan to discuss policy priorities.  \u201cWe are really excited about getting to work and hitting the ground running in 2017,\u201d Ryan said after the morning meeting.  Meanwhile, there apparently is a split over the next head of the Republican National Committee. Current chairman Priebus is heading to the White House to be chief of staff.  Priebus is said to support Michigan Republican Party chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel for the post, though other senior officials are backing Nick Ayers, an aide to Vice President-elect Mike Pence. McDaniel addressed the Michigan crowd before Mr. Trump took the stage but no RNC announcement was made.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "As America votes, bringing to a close the most cantankerous presidential contest in modern memory, markets far and wide are expecting Hillary Clinton to win. Billions of dollars are riding on this projection, but of course, that doesn\u2019t guarantee it will happen.\u00a0 Clinton, viewed among investors as the status quo candidate, seems less inclined to take wild steps that would upset the markets. While she has inveighed against Wall Street on the campaign trail, she also has been a friend to the financial services industry as a Democratic senator from New York. Her deliverance during the weekend from more FBI trouble over her email has given markets new heart, and they rallied on Monday after a swoon of more than a week. Disrupting the status quo is the watchword of her Republican rival, Donald Trump, to the dismay of the investment community. He promises draconian crackdowns on trade and immigration, and he upsets many with his take-no-prisoners style. \u201cCombined with his nontraditional campaign persona, Clinton represents a more known and welcomed outcome,\u201d wrote Jason Pride, director of investment strategy with asset manager Glenmede, in a report. Wall Street analysts widely believe that, if Trump is victorious, the result would be a stock market bloodbath. Macroeconomic Advisers has predicted that a Trump triumph would shave 7 percent off the S&P 500 stock index, wiping out more than $1 trillion in market value.\u00a0 Certainly, a Clinton win is hardly a forgone conclusion. Many polls put her in the lead, but not by wide margins. The latest\u00a0CBS News poll shows Clinton at 45 percent and Trump at 41 percent. In the 1980 match-up between incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter and GOP challenger Ronald Reagan, the polls were tight throughout the fall, with the final Gallup survey showing 47 percent for Reagan and 44 percent for Carter. On Election Day, though, Reagan won handily, 51 to 41 percent. \u00a0 For the moment, however, markets are signaling their expectation that Clinton will be the next president: Stocks. In the wake of her FBI exoneration over the weekend, the market\u2019s Monday rally erased much of the nine-day slide it suffered through last Friday, the longest losing streak since December 1980. During those nine trading sessions, the S&P 500 slumped 3 percent. The 2.2 percent advance on Monday, to 2,131, is within hailing distance of the most recent high on Oct. 24, of 2,151. The nine-day market descent gained impetus following FBI Director James Comey\u2019s Oct. 28 bombshell announcement that the bureau was examining a new trove of emails that might be relevant to its earlier investigation of Clinton\u2019s private email server. But the stock retreat was hardly a rout.\u00a0As Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser to financial services giant Allianz, put it in a commentary, the drop was a \u201cremarkably orderly and gradual repricing of risk on account of higher political uncertainty ... for a high probability Hillary Clinton victory.\u201d Accompanying the recent downdraft was a surge in the so-called fear gauge, a.k.a. the CBO Volatility Index or VIX. But once Comey cleared Clinton on Sunday, the VIX did an about-face, as well. It had climbed from 13 on Oct. 24 to 22 last Friday, then slipped back to 18.7 on Monday.\u00a0 Markets around the world rose Monday. For example, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, which had been drooping for five days, scored a 1.7 percent gain, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei, also off for five days, rose 1.6 percent. Election markets. These bourses, where people wager on who\u2019ll prevail on Election Day, display an overwhelming belief that Clinton will take the White House. Predictit gives Clinton 82 percent odds of winning, and the Iowa Electronic Markets finds her chances of victory at 80 percent. The two-party vote breakdown for the candidates is 53-46 percent, favoring Clinton, the Iowa group says. The odds are similar for the three betting sites based in the British isles: Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and Betfair.\u00a0 Mexican peso. While the U.S. dollar enjoyed an upturn versus world currencies on Monday, the conspicuous exception was the Mexican peso. It gained almost 2 percent over the weekend, after the Comey news, amid perceptions that Trump would not become president. From Trump\u2019s announcing his candidacy in 2015 to the current day, the Republican nominee has slammed Mexico as a foe, complaining that its illegal immigrants were criminals and that it lured U.S. manufacturing jobs south of the border, harming American workers.\u00a0 Trump has proposed slapping a 35 percent tariff on Mexican goods, which would hurt its economy. Nearly 80 percent of Mexico\u2019s exports go to the U.S. With a GDP of $18.5 trillion, the U.S. has the globe\u2019s largest economy, dwarfing that of Mexico ($1.1 trillion, 15th place).\u00a0 Gold.\u00a0The price of gold tracks Clinton\u2019s political fortunes well lately, and those of economies from Britain to China. The ultimate refuge investment when economic turmoil looms, or appears to, gold fell almost 2 percent on Monday. The yellow metal had pushed upward in price for much of the year, due to fears about slowing international economies and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, as well as improving prospects that Trump would gain the Oval Office. The kiddie poll. Up to now, perhaps the most unerring predictor is the straw vote of students at the Benjamin Franklin Elementary School\u00a0in Yorktown Heights, New York. The youngsters have correctly called the presidential election outcome since the school opened in 1968. Kids from kindergarten to fifth grade study the candidates\u2019 stances on issues, avoiding personalities and poll showings, then cast mock ballots. A possible reason for the kid vote\u2019s accuracy may be the school\u2019s diverse makeup, with pupils from a variety of ethnic and economic backgrounds.\u00a0 The school\u2019s tally for this year\u2019s election: Clinton beats Trump, by 52 to 43 percent.

            "article_content": "LONDON - Conciliatory comments from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the aftermath of his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton helped global stock markets erase a large chunk of their earlier losses Wednesday. Though uncertainty remains over Trump\u2019s trade, immigration and geopolitical policies, investors appeared somewhat soothed by his victory speech, in which he praised Clinton and urged Americans to \u201ccome together as one united people\u201d after a deeply divisive campaign. When  it first became apparent that Trump was surging to victory following a run of  triumphs in key swing states, predictions about the open on Wall Street  were extremely negative. The Dow Jones industrials was forecast to open some 800 points  lower. But following a fairly measured victory speech by the president-elect, the Dow is now  anticipated to open down 360 points, or 2 percent. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s conciliatory acceptance speech, which suggests that he can be a more statesmanlike President rather than the demagogue of the election campaign, has helped to reverse some of the initial sell-off in equities in the immediate aftermath of his shock triumph,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist, in a note. In Europe, Germany\u2019s DAX was down 0.7 percent at 10,408 while the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.1 percent lower at 6,838. U.S. stocks are expected to open lower, too, though by far less than earlier predicted. Dow futures are 1.7 percent lower at 17,974 while the broader S&P 500 futures were down 1.8 percent at 2,097. As Trump gained the lead in the electoral vote count, investors became increasingly uneasy and share prices tumbled in Asia, which were open during the election results. Dow futures were down 4 percent at one point. However, by the time Trump was confirmed the winner and made his speech, financial markets had steadied. \u201cThere\u2019s scope to applaud the fact that the opening bell will come with the certainty of who the next president will be, but given the lack of detail on an economic policy agenda, investors will unsurprisingly still be feeling wary,\u201d said Remo Fritschi, Institutional Sales Manager at ADS Securities London. The dollar also recouped some ground, while assets that many investors search out at times of uncertainty, such as gold and the Swiss franc, came off earlier highs. An ounce of gold was up 2.4 percent at $1,305 while the dollar was only 0.4 percent lower at 0.9734 Swiss franc. One currency that remains heavily sold is the Mexican peso. It was down 8.5 percent as the prospect of a wall along the United States\u2019 southern border - a key campaigning point for Trump - has come one step closer to reality. Trump has insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall. Also potentially impacting the peso is Trump\u2019s threat to rip up trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, a key plank in Mexico\u2019s economic strategy and growth. \u201cIf Trump is able to follow through with these suggestions, Mexican activity will suffer greatly,\u201d said Jane Foley, senior foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank International. Under the U.S. constitution, Trump doesn\u2019t formally take the reins of power until January but he will begin the transition to his presidency almost immediately. In the coming weeks, investors will be looking to see if he further tempers some of the rhetoric that polarized American opinion and often spooked investors in financial markets. Trump\u2019s victory could make the U.S. Federal Reserve less likely to raise its key interest rate at its next meeting in mid-December - especially if financial markets remain under pressure. Some analysts are ruling it out entirely. \u201cLess chance of a Fed rate hike also helps keep investors smiling at the prospect of cheap money and accommodative global monetary policy stance for a while longer,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, an analyst at Accendo Markets. Another point of interest will center on the U.S.\u2019s trade relations with China and its impact across Asia. Trump\u2019s victory has raised concerns that the U.S. and China might embark on a trade war of sorts and that protectionism around the world will grow. In Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 stock index closed 5.4 percent lower, recouping some losses, at 16,251.54. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng closed 2.2 percent lower to 22,415.19 while the main index in Shanghai fell 0.6 percent to 3,128.77. \u201cInvestors will right now be in the process of attempting to differentiate between Trump\u2019s actual policy positions and some of the more outlandish statements made on the campaign trail,\u201d said Michael Levy, an emerging markets investment director at Barings. \u201cMarkets tend to assume the worst and react immediately, and that appears to be happening,\u201d said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. \u201cThere will be significant pressure for Mr. Trump to start to clarify some of his policy intentions, after which we may see a recovery as we did with Brexit.\u201d \u00a0 South Korea\u2019s trade ministry held an emergency meeting to review prospects of U.S. trade policies after the presidential elections. Top officials from Japan\u2019s central bank and finance ministry met Wednesday to discuss how to cope with the gyrations in financial markets.\u00a0 Japan\u2019s Deputy Finance Minister Masatsugu Asakawa said speculative movements were at work in the currency markets. \u201cWe will take necessary steps if speculative actions continue,\u201d Asakawa said.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats are turning to Sen. Chuck Schumer, a Brooklyn-bred partisan infighter with a pragmatic streak, to steer them into the Donald Trump era. Republicans are sticking with the genteel Kentuckian, Sen. Mitch McConnell, who lacks Schumer\u2019s instinct for soundbites but has been a brutally effective legislative tactician. Senate Democrats elected Schumer Wednesday morning as the new Democratic leader, succeeding Harry Reid, who\u2019s retiring. They also re-elected Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois as Senate Minority Whip and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington as assistant Democratic leader.\u00a0 Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan will serve as chairwoman of the Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mark Warner of Virginia will serve as vice chairs of the conference.\u00a0 Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will serve as chairwoman of the Steering Committee and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, will serve as chairman of outreach.\u00a0 These are the following ranking members of committees that were elected: Agriculture:\u00a0Senator Debbie Stabenow Armed Services:\u00a0Senator Jack Reed Appropriations:\u00a0Senator Patrick Leahy Banking: Senator Sherrod Brown Budget:\u00a0Senator Bernie Sanders Commerce:\u00a0Senator Bill Nelson Energy:\u00a0Senator Maria Cantwell EPW:\u00a0Senator Tom Carper Finance:\u00a0Senator Ron Wyden Foreign Relations:\u00a0Senator Ben Cardin HELP:\u00a0Senator Patty Murray HSGAC:\u00a0Senator Claire McCaskill Indian Affairs:\u00a0Senator Tom Udall Judiciary:\u00a0Senator Dianne Feinstein Rules:\u00a0Senator Amy Klobuchar Small Business:\u00a0Senator Jeanne Shaheen Veterans Affairs:\u00a0Senator Jon Tester Aging:\u00a0Senator Bob Casey Ethics:\u00a0Senator Chris Coons Intelligence:\u00a0Senator Mark Warner JEC:\u00a0Senator Martin Heinrich Senate Republicans re-elected McConnell as their leader. In the House, Republicans voted Tuesday to re-nominate Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., after recalcitrant conservatives and Trump backers upset by Ryan\u2019s frigid campaign-season treatment of Trump fell into line. Democrats postponed their leadership election until Nov. 30 after junior lawmakers demanded more time to digest the party\u2019s disappointing Election Day showing, a warning shot at House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. McConnell opened the Senate\u2019s first session of the lame-duck Congress calling for unity. \u201cWe\u2019re not Democrats first. We\u2019re not Republicans first. We are Americans first,\u201d said McConnell, who early in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency said his goal was to limit him to one term. Schumer, 65, has been No. 3 Senate Democratic leader and is a confidante of Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., departing after a three-decade career in the chamber. Schumer has a history of being a savvy partisan combatant willing to strike compromises, such as on a 2013 bipartisan immigration overhaul that ended up dying. Schumer is vaulting past No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Dick Durbin of Illinois and will lead Democrats\u2019 last line of defense against the Trump White House and GOP-controlled House. Senate Democrats - outnumbered 52-48, including two independents who back Democrats - could prevent McConnell from getting the 60 votes he\u2019ll need on some important issues. Schumer has said he\u2019ll seek opportunities to work with Trump but will face pressure from disappointed Democratic activists to adopt a hard line. It\u2019s unclear how he\u2019ll balance the demands of progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., against red-state senators facing re-election in 2018 and needing protection from politically damaging votes. McConnell, 74, was Senate minority leader for eight years before the GOP took control of the chamber for 2015 and 2016. He\u2019s widely backed among Republicans. He\u2019s pushed a conservative agenda while cutting budget deals with the Obama administration, and boldly refused to let the Senate consider Obama\u2019s nomination of federal judge Merrick Garland to fill a Supreme Court vacancy that occurred last February. That move paid dividends when Trump was elected. On Tuesday, House Republicans re-nominated Ryan by unanimous voice vote. Ryan will need 218 votes - a majority - to be approved when the full, new House convenes Jan. 3. With the GOP on target to have 241 seats next year, Ryan can afford just 23 defectors, but many Republicans expect Ryan to be safe in the GOP afterglow of Trump\u2019s win. Aiding Ryan: Support from Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, which Ryan and others underscored to Republican lawmakers before they voted. \u201cThe momentum is with us,\u201d Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said in an interview after nominating Ryan during Tuesday\u2019s closed-door meeting. \u201cThe last thing we need is to distract attention right now with a leadership fight. We\u2019re all pulling in the same direction.\u201d Mulvaney is in the tea party-leaning House Freedom Caucus, which has frequently rebelled against GOP leaders. Freedom Caucus leader Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said that while he expected Ryan to be elected speaker, \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d during the lame-duck session with Ryan\u2019s handling of spending bills and rules giving rank-and-file lawmakers more power. At a meeting of House Democrats Tuesday, Pelosi told her colleagues \u201cwe\u2019ve been through hell\u201d with the election and that Democrats should draw contrasts with Trump, according to an aide in the room. But all were not happy. \u201cEverything\u2019s not good. Business as usual is not going to work,\u201d said Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., among those who pushed for the delayed leadership vote.",

            "article_content": "Vice President-elect Mike Pence worked Sunday to reassure people that Donald Trump\u2019s web of businesses will not pose a conflict of interest for him when he takes office in January, saying there will be \u201cproper separation.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very confident that the president-elect and his extraordinary talented family are going to work with the best legal minds in this country and create the proper separation from their business enterprise during his duties as President of the United States,\u201d Pence told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d  In the days since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, there\u2019s been concern that he is not taking the necessary steps to separate his business interests from his service in the White House. Mr. Trump has declared that his adult children will take over running his business empire, rather than putting things in a blind trust as past presidents have done.  The New York Times reported that Trump met last week with Indian business partners building a Trump-branded apartment complex in Mumbai, further prompting concerns about conflicts of interest. And his daughter, Ivanka Trump, sat in on Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in New York last week, raising questions about how involved she will be in White House business. Raising further eyebrows, the Washington Post reported that Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel held a post-election reception for foreign diplomats to pitch them on the hotel and its amenities. Asked whether foreign companies that do business with Trump\u2019s companies will be disclosed, Pence would not say -- but said the laws concerning the issue will be \u201cstrictly adhered to.\u201d  \u201cAll of the laws pertaining to his business dealings and his service as President of the United States will be strictly adhered to and he\u2019s set that tone from the very beginning,\u201d Pence said. Pence, who has removed all lobbyists from the transition team, would not say that lobbyists will not be allowed to work in the White House. \u201cAs you know we made changes as soon as I took over the transition efforts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made changes -- we moved lobbyists out of the transition team and that\u2019s going to continue to be a lodestar and I can tell your viewers that the president-elect is determined to move ethics reform in the next year in the Congress of the United States.\u201d Asked again to clarify whether lobbyists would be allowed to serve in the administration, Pence replied that Mr. Trump \u201cmade clear \u2026 we are going to have people in the administration who are 100 percent focused on serving the American people and moving the Trump agenda forward.\u201d Pence said the first item on Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda will be repealing the Affordable Care Act -- a comment in seeming contradiction with Mr. Trump, who told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last week that he was open to amending the law instead and favored keeping certain provisions of Obamacare in place.  \u201cThe president-elect has already made the decision in conversations with Republican leaders in the House and Senate that we\u2019re going to lift the extraordinary burden of Obamacare off the backs of the American people and off the backs of American businesses,\u201d Pence said. \u201cRepealing Obamacare will be the first priority in a session that will be characterized by tax reform, rebuilding the military, infrastructure, ending illegal immigration and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.\u201d Pence also confirmed that 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who met with Trump in New Jersey yesterday, is under consideration as Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of state. He said it was \u201cyet to be seen\u201d whether there would be any additional cabinet announcements on Sunday. \u201cWe spent the better part of an hour together with him, and then I know that the two of them actually had some private time together,\u201d Pence said. \u201cI would tell you that it was not only a cordial meeting but also it was a very substantive meeting, and I can say that Gov. Romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as Secretary of State of the United States.\u201d As for the question of whether Trump\u2019s administration will reintroduce the use of waterboarding, an issue on which Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) sharply criticized Mr. Trump at a security conference over the weekend, Pence replied by just noting that Mr. Trump has made clear he will focus on the fight against ISIS. \u201cPresident Donald Trump is going to focus on confronting and defeating radical Islamic terrorism as a threat to this country,\u201d Pence replied. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a president again who will never say what we\u2019ll never do. In President-elect Donald Trump you have someone who believes that we shouldn\u2019t be telling the enemy what our tactics or our strategies are.\u201d Again, asked to follow up and clarify whether the Trump administration would pursue a return to waterboarding tactics, Pence replied: \u201cWell I think the President-elect made his views on that quite clear during the course of the campaign, but as we go forward what I can tell you is it\u2019s not going to be about a specific tactic.\u201d The vice president-elect also addressed the controversy over his attendance at the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d Friday night, where audience members booed him and cast members spoke directly to him from the stage at the end of the show. \u201cI wasn\u2019t offended by what was said, I\u2019ll leave to others whether it was the appropriate venue to say it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to assure people who were disappointed in the election results, people who are feeling anxious about this time in the life of our nation, that President-elect Donald Trump meant exactly what he said on election night, that he is going to be the president of all the people of the United States of America.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

When Trump promised that voting day would be like Brexit \u201cplus plus plus,\u201d he wasn\u2019t just predicting a surprise victory, but a chance to shake up the establishment. And CBS News correspondent Charlie D\u2019Agata says the shockwaves are already being felt around the globe.\u00a0 From Tokyo to London, the stunned world awoke to the results of a U.S. election more closely watched than any in modern history. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m a bit lost for words,\u201d one Londoner said on his way to work Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve been up since 4:30 actually, watching the election results. It\u2019s not so much of a surprise after what happened with Brexit here, you know.\u201d\u00a0 Though America\u2019s next commander-in-chief has bad-mouthed NATO, slamming allies for not ponying up their fair share, the NATO Secretary General was willing to let that slide.\u00a0 \u201cI look forward to working with him,\u201d Jens Stoltenberg said. \u201cOur alliance has brought together our closest friends for almost 70 years.\u201d\u00a0 Seventy years or not, European allies like French President Francois Hollande stood ready to call Trump out, saying \u201ccertain positions taken during the American campaign must be confronted.\u201d That, from a man who said Trump\u2019s \u201cexcesses made him want to retch.\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- who has come under blistering attacks over her immigration policies -- said Trump\u2019s victory featured \u201cconfrontations that were difficult to bear.\u201d The bottom line seems to be that global leaders who were baffled by Trump\u2019s statements during the campaign, now wonder whether that was just bluster, or a new direction in U.S. foreign policy.  As one German government minister put it, \u201cthe world won\u2019t end, but it will get a whole lot crazier.\u201d\u00a0",

At a news conference Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke about allegations that an off-duty Muslim police officer was threatened by a man who told her to \u201cgo back to her country.\u201d  Asked if he thought Trump was to blame for an increase in similar incidents, the mayor said \u201cIt\u2019s obviously more complicated than that. It is not linear.\u201d  But he accused Trump of using \u201chate speech\u201d and saying \u201chorrible things\u201d about Muslims.  Police in New York have logged 43 possible hate crimes since Trump\u2019s election, double the number during the same period last year.\u00a0 Also on Monday, officials said a New York City transit worker who is Muslim was pushed down the stairs at Grand Central Terminal by a man who called her a terrorist. Trump has denied that his proposals on immigration and restrictions on Muslims entering the U.S. amounted to hate speech. In an interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Mr. Trump told people who were committing violence in his name to \u201cstop it.\u201d Mr. Trump is living in New York City until Inauguration Day.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON D.C. -- A popular Italian restaurant in Washington D.C. has issued an apology, saying it unintentionally hosted a white nationalist group and the diners performed a Nazi salute while eating there.  Maggiano\u2019s Little Italy posted an apology on its Facebook page Monday.\u00a0 On Friday night, Maggiano\u2019s in Friendship Heights was the inadvertent site of a protest that caused us to close our... The restaurant said it didn\u2019t realize it was hosting a banquet Friday for a group called the National Policy Institute, whose website says it advocates for the heritage and identity of those of European descent in the U.S.\u00a0 The post said the group made reservation at the last minute using a different name. The group was gathered in Washington for a conference and celebrated Republican Donald Trump\u2019s election.  A tweeted photo from former reality star Tila Tequila appeared to show people making a Nazi salute. Her account later seemed to have been suspended.\u00a0 \u00a0Maggiano\u2019s said it has donated its profits from the evening to the Anti-Defamation League.\u00a0 The\u00a0far right-wing group known as the alt-right\u00a0latched onto to the Trump campaign -- and some of its leaders say his victory has given them a big boost. \u201cHail Trump, hail our people, hail victory,\u201d was heard over the weekend at a meeting in Washington, D.C. A meeting of the National Policy Institute drew hundreds to the Ronald Reagan pavilion in Washington, CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan reported.\u00a0 Since 2008, the alt- or alternative-right movement lived mostly on obscure message boards online.\u00a0 It gained more attention after Trump hired\u00a0Steve Bannon\u00a0to run his presidential campaign in August. \u00a0 Bannon\u2019s Breitbart website is, among other things, seen as the\u00a0largest platform for the alt-right message\u00a0-- with more than 300 million views in the last month. Thirty-eight-year old Richard Spencer, who is president of the National Policy Institute, said he is enthusiastic about Bannon acting as the strategist for President-elect Donald Trump.\u00a0 \u201cBecause Breitbart has been an open place for a lot of ideas that I care about,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Bannon denies being alt-right. Its members are usually college-educated white males, with strong right-wing views. They are difficult to define because of the wide range of members \u2013 from those who believe that America will be great only when it looks out for itself, to those who believe in anti-immigration and white dominance.\u00a0 \u201cThey say instead of asking what\u2019s good for the world they ask what is good for us,\u201d explained Professor Thomas Main, a public policy professor at Baruch College in New York City. He has been following the movement for years.\u00a0 He said after the Great Recession, and with the country\u2019s increasing minority population, many white men began to feel left out of the political process. \u201cI think what happened is that all of those shocks to the system, in a lot of people, especially on the right say, \u2018gee our current way of thinking is not working for us, we need something new,\u2019\u201d said Main.\u00a0 What does Spencer say to people who call groups like his racist? \u201cThe word racist doesn\u2019t have any meaning anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically calling me a mean old guy.\u201d\u00a0 Does he discriminate against people because of the color of their skin? \u201cEveryone is discriminating in all sorts of things in terms of life,\u201d he said. \u201cI discriminate all the time \u2013 discriminating is living.\u201d\u00a0 Spencer said he opposes violence.

The U.S. economy has expanded enormously in recent decades, even accounting for periodic recessions and financial crises.

Donald Trump is going after the local union leader who represents Carrier employees, tweeting that Chuck Jones did \u201ca terrible job representing workers.\u201d Jones, the president of the United Steelworkers 1999, initially welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s deal with Carrier\u2019s parent company to keep some jobs in the U.S., but he later said Mr. Trump had \u201clied his a** off\u201d about the agreement.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke face-to-face for what could be the last time on Sunday on the sidelines of an economic summit underway in Peru. The world leaders have spent much of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency at odds over a host of issues, and Putin spent the 2016 presidential campaign cheering for Obama\u2019s political rival, Donald Trump, who will take the Oval Office on January 20. Presidents Obama and Putin were seen chatting as reporters were allowed in briefly for the start of the opening session of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima. They stood off to the side together momentarily before shaking hands and then taking their seats around a table. Although their words weren\u2019t audible to journalists present, the White House said the conversation lasted four minutes and mostly focused on Syria. A White House official alter said Mr. Obama encouraged Mr. Putin to uphold his country\u2019s commitments under the Minsk deal aimed at ending the Ukraine conflict. The White House said Obama also called for U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to keep working in initiatives with other countries to lower violence in the Syria crisis and alleviate suffering. At the G-20 summit in China earlier this fall, Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin met to negotiate a ceasefire in Syria but weren\u2019t able to reach an agreement, with Mr. Obama\u00a0saying \u201cgaps in trust\u201d\u00a0between the U.S. and Russia were hindering discussions. Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin have long had a strained relationship. President-elect Trump\u2019s election has raised speculation and concern he might do less to challenge Russian aggression. Trump has spoken warmly about Putin, and vice versa. The American and Russian leaders aren\u2019t expected to have any formal meetings while both are in Peru. Trying to tie up loose ends of his foreign policy agenda, Mr. Obama on Saturday instead found world leaders more focused on someone else: Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Global hand-wringing over America\u2019s next president has taken much of the wind out of President Obama\u2019s final overseas trip. Adopting an altruistic tone, Mr. Obama has offered frequent reassurances that the U.S. won\u2019t renege on its commitments. Yet he\u2019s been at a loss to quell concerns fully, given new signals from Trump that he intends to govern much the way he campaigned.  Mr. Obama\u2019s visit to Peru, the last stop on his trip, has brought those concerns to the forefront: Much of Latin America is on edge about a potentially dramatic shift in U.S. immigration policy under Mr. Trump. And Asian leaders gathered in Lima for an Asia-Pacific economic summit are trying to game out what Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency will mean for trade with the world\u2019s largest economy. \u00a0",

You\u2019ve won, and the host presents you with two options: a refrigerator and a mystery box.  The fridge is a fridge \u2013 you pretty much know what you\u2019re going to get. It might not be the best fridge. Maybe it\u2019s a bad one. You probably like your current fridge more. But it\u2019s something.  Then there\u2019s the mystery box. You have no idea what\u2019s in it. Maybe there\u2019s gold in it. Maybe it\u2019s filled with spiders. In any event, it\u2019s certainly the more exciting option, which is why the contestant so often picks it.\u00a0 So America has chosen the mystery box, and now we get to find out what\u2019s in it. And the first thing we\u2019re going to find out is how interested Trump is in actually doing the things a president does.  The often-heard theory from liberals over the last few months was that Trump didn\u2019t want to be president. Clearly he did, and he worked very hard for it. But that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t be happy to outsource much of the day-to-day stuff that\u2019s not glamorous or fun.  A data point to consider here: According to the The New York Times\u2019 Robert Draper, Trump pretty much told John Kasich he could run the country if he\u2019d be his running mate.  Donald Jr. was reportedly the one to make the offer, and said that his father\u2019s vice presidential candidate \u201cwould be in charge of domestic and foreign policy.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, would be in charge of \u201cmaking America great again.\u201d\u00a0 Who knows if a similar deal was made with Mike Pence. But it would make a degree of sense, given what we know about Trump his enthusiasms. You could see him easily gliding into the role of the boss \u2013 the decider, if you will \u2013 who is still comfortable with outsourcing a lot of what he does.\u00a0 It\u2019s likewise easy to envision Trump spending a lot of time at the southern border in a hard hat talking about (and perhaps ultimately building) his wall. It might be safe to assume that they\u2019ll be other big infrastructure undertakings that Trump will make visiting a priority, in addition to big deals to be made at various international summits. He\u2019ll get the attention and the press doing something he\u2019s comfortable with and enjoys doing. This arrangement also would make sense for Trump because he\u2019s not really one for ideology, and he certainly isn\u2019t a policy wonk. Pence is by all means an ideologue, and one known and liked by the Republican ideologues set to run Congress.  Together, they would do what normal parties try to do while in power: force through an agenda, one that probably won\u2019t be too distinct from the once the GOP has pushed for decades. But let\u2019s allow that it also have certain Trumpian quirks, such as tariffs and that aforementioned wall.  That\u2019s not to say that a Trump presidency will be anywhere near normal. The one thing we know, in fact, is that it won\u2019t be, given his eccentricities and those of his kitchen cabinet: Newt Gingrich, Michael Flynn, etc.  But it\u2019s more than that. We don\u2019t know how loyal Paul Ryan, an immigration proponent and fiscal wonk, will be to him. We don\u2019t know what will happen to the various conservative think tanks that have spent decades churning out policy papers Trump is unlikely to agree with. The GOP could still easily break apart.  We have no idea if he can actually fashion together some kind of governing coalition, or if his sky-high negatives will lead many in his party to keep him at arm\u2019s length. We don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll spend much of time trying to settle old scores.\u00a0 We don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to recruit top-level advisors and experts to fill out his administration, or if he even wants to. The technocrats who usually have such sway in any administration might be pushed aside entirely for a gallery of amateurs and loyalists \u2013 such as the ones who just pushed his ramshackle barely-campaign across the finish line.  We don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll stumble into a Constitutional crisis within hours of taking the oath of office.  That\u2019s all an invitation to a great degree of risk and uncertainty. Part of why it might be smart for Trump to let Pence manage things behind the scenes then, is that if it\u2019s understood that the vice president calls a lot of the shots, and that that vice president is trusted by the GOP, it promises some degree of predictability and continuity.  That will be an asset for President Trump for at least the first few months. Mystery can be alluring, but chaos makes people nervous, and less likely to go along with whatever big ideas he\u2019ll have. It also makes markets nervous, and the last thing President Trump would need is some sort of stock crash or mass exodus of capital.  It\u2019s a tricky business, predicting what Trump will do and why he\u2019ll do it. But Pence taking on a tremendously powerful role in the new administration just might be unavoidable. \u00a0 Will Rahn is a political correspondent and managing director, politics, for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Investors who initially turned bearish at the idea of Donald Trump occupying the White House are rediscovering their bullish streak.\u00a0 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high on Thursday, shooting up 218 points, or 1.2, percent to end at 18,218. That topped the Big Board\u2019s last record-high on August 15, when it closed at 18,636 points.\u00a0 Banks and other financial companies led U.S. stocks mostly higher in afternoon trading Thursday. Consumer-focused companies, utilities and technology stocks were among the biggest decliners. The market was coming off a big rally following the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. Financial markets are rising on speculation that the Trump administration, backed by the Republican-controlled Congress, will ramp up public spending, as well as cut personal and corporate taxes, as he pledged during the presidential campaign.\u00a0 Investors think Trump \u201cwill have more success in implementing his domestic policy agenda in light of the Republicans\u2019 retention of Congress,\u201d Capital Economics said in a note.\u00a0 The upcoming Trump presidency, which will commence on Jan. 20, triggered a strong rally on Wednesday that extended somewhat into trading Thursday. Traders were focusing on Trump\u2019s promises to boost U.S. economic growth through infrastructure spending and by cutting red tape, rather than uncertainties such as what he might do with trade agreements.  The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index added 4 points to close at 2,167. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 42 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,209. Before the election, markets had been worried about a Trump presidency because his campaign promises carried few policy details, making him an unknown quantity compared with rival Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe had a gangbuster day yesterday; call it a Trump rally,\u201d said Doug Cote, chief market strategist for Voya Investment Management. \u201cToday we\u2019re having a little breather, a little rest, but the key thing that will also keep the market going is the S&P 500 corporate earnings for the third quarter are positive for the first time in six quarters.\u201d Banks and other financial companies got a boost amid speculation that a Trump presidency could result in higher interest rates and less government regulation. JPMorgan Chase climbed $2.78, or 3.8 percent, to $76.03. Goldman Sachs rose $6.75, or 3.5 percent, to $199.38. Wells Fargo gained $3.01, or 6.3 percent, to $51, while Discover Financial Services added $3.03, or 5 percent, to $63.32. Bond prices continued to fall, sending yields higher. Bond investors expect that Trump\u2019s plans to increase spending on infrastructure while also lowering taxes will lead to stronger economic growth and possibly inflation, both of which are bad for bonds.\u00a0 Benchmark U.S. crude was down 50 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $44.77 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was down 39 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $45.97 a barrel in London. The dollar has been fairly solid since Trump\u2019s victory. The U.S. currency rose to 106.66 yen from 105.84 yen on Wednesday. The euro was down to $1.0892 from $1.0930. The Mexican peso continued to weaken against the dollar. One dollar now buys 20.50 pesos, more than the 19.87 pesos it bought late Wednesday. Investors worry that Trump\u2019s anti-immigration stance and intention to repeal a trade pact with Mexico could hurt that country\u2019s economy.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign was filled with its fair share of controversy and shocking moments. From policy proposals to off-the-cuff comments, Trump managed to offend many minority groups. Now that he has reached the highest office in the land, the country is wondering what his message and agenda will actually be. \u201c60 Minutes\u201d will air an interview with the president-elect on Sunday night, his first major sit down since winning the election, to discuss just that. Some of his most contentious campaign topics have already been featured on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in his two appearances during the campaign. He spoke with Scott Pelley once in September 2015 when the campaign was just getting started, and with Lesley Stahl in July shortly after naming his Vice President, Mike Pence.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall and we\u2019re going to create a border. It\u2019s going to be a great wall and it\u2019s not going to be very expensive,\u201d Trump told Scott Pelley in September 2015. When Pelley asked how he would build and pay for it, Trump answered \u201cIt will be a real wall. It\u2019ll be a wall that works.\u201d And on the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., Trump told Pelley he planned to \u201cround them up\u201d in a \u201chumane way.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesn\u2019t sound nice. But not everything is nice,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0 Trump still promises to build the wall, and to make Mexico pay for it.\u00a0 Donald Trump\u2019s call to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States shocked people from across the political spectrum -- including his eventual vice president pick, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Pence had tweeted \u201cCalls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.\u201d But when the two spoke with Lesley Stahl in July, they were in agreement on the ban. \u201cWe have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of this country, and Donald Trump is right to articulate that view,\u201d Pence said. Trump doubled down on his ban. \u201cCall it whatever you want, change territories, but there are territories and terror states and terror nations that we\u2019re not gonna allow the people to come into our country. And we\u2019re gonna have a thing called \u2018extreme vetting.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 When it comes to defeating ISIS, Trump offered up a hands-off strategy in Syria. \u201cIf you look at Syria. Russia wants to get rid of ISIS. We want to get rid of ISIS. Maybe let Russia do it. Let \u2018em get rid of ISIS. What the hell do we care?\u201d he told Pelley. And in Iraq, Trump told both Pelley and Stahl he would put troops on the ground to fight ISIS. He went as far as to suggest he might declare war.\u00a0 \u201cNow look, we are going to get rid of ISIS, big league. And we\u2019re going to get rid of \u2018em fast. And we\u2019re going to use surrounding states. We\u2019re going to use NATO, probably. And we\u2019re going to declare war. It is war,\u201d he said in July. Trump has also said that he won\u2019t reveal too much of his plan, because he doesn\u2019t want to give away his strategy to the enemy. It\u2019s no secret that as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign went on,his attitude toward the media grew more and more hostile. Even back in September 2015, that relationship was already soiled. When Pelley questioned whether Trump\u2019s quick tendency to pick a fight means he has thin skin, Trump fought back. \u201cYou know, some of the media is among the worst people I\u2019ve ever met. I mean a pretty good percentage is really a terrible group of people. They write lies, they write false stories. They know they\u2019re false. It makes no difference. And frankly I don\u2019t call it thin-skinned, I\u2019m angry.\u201d Trump ran on an \u201canti-establishment\u201d platform, painting himself as an outsider. But in July, he told Stahl he used to consider himself part of it. \u201cI am a person that used to be establishment, when I\u2019d give them hundreds of thousands of dollars. But when I decided to run, I became very anti-establishment because I understand the system better than anyone.\u201d His pick of Mike Pence for Vice President, he said, was partially to encourage unity with those Republicans worried about his candidacy by picking someone who is \u201cvery establishment.\u201d Cydney Adams is a senior manager of social media for CBS News.

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump was elected Tuesday on calls to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d that is Washington, D.C. -- but former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Trump will need to have a \u201cvery, very aggressive\u201d first year in office if he hopes to overcome the entrenched nature of the country\u2019s capital. \u201cThis is a city which if you don\u2019t shove it as hard as you can while you have momentum, they will surround you,\u201d Gingrich, who is a vice-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation. \u201cI mean, the swamp doesn\u2019t want to be drained. And the swamp will just suck you in if you let it, so he needs to have a very, very aggressive first year.\u201d At a time when many Democrats worry Trump does not have the temperament to be president, or to deal with people who disagree with him, Gingrich said Trump\u2019s post-election conduct indicates \u201csteps toward stability and maturity.\u201d \u201cHis victory speech was very conciliatory, very much in the right direction. I think his visit to the White House was very respectful on both sides and I think encouraging in that sense,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cI think his meeting with Paul Ryan, and with Mitch McConnell, and the fact that he\u2019s integrating Mike Pence so thoroughly, which also happened with Cheney.\u201d \u201cI think all those things show you steps towards stability and maturity that are very, very encouraging,\u201d he continued. Gingrich said there\u2019s potential for Trump to compromise with congressional Democrats on certain issues, including infrastructure and tax reform -- and that for Trump, getting support from across the aisle on some legislation is important to their long-term success. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that Trump try to have as many Democrats as possible help him do this,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause one of the lessons of the Obama years is, if you do things that are big on a purely partisan basis, they\u2019re not stable. I mean, I think Trump wants to change America to make it great again for a generation, not just for eight years.\u201d That said, Gingrich noted that Republicans\u2019 victories weren\u2019t constrained to the White House -- and said the \u201cshift towards Republican government\u201d in the House and Senate as well as in state legislatures gives him the ability to confidently govern on Republican policies. \u201cFirst of all, he won. And he won pretty decisively in the Electoral College,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that the deeper thing is the Republicans won the House. They won the Senate. They won the governorships...most Republican governors in history. Most Republican state legislators in history. So if you look at the country, there\u2019s certainly a shift towards Republican government on a pretty big scale.\u201d Gingrich said he\u2019s not concerned about the fact that Trump lost the popular vote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. If the electoral system had been based on the popular vote, Gingrich said, Trump would have competed in large blue states like California -- and asserted that Trump could have picked up \u201cat least 2 million votes\u201d in California just by competing there. \u201cRemember, in 49 states, he had a 2,200,000 vote majority. And then there\u2019s California,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cWe don\u2019t compete in California. The current rules of the game, we\u2019re not going to carry California. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a sad cycle. They don\u2019t invest because they\u2019re not going to carry it. So they -- so it gets worse every year. If this had been a general election where -- where the total vote mattered, we\u2019d have competed in California.\u201d Gingrich also said the idea that Trump\u2019s rise was aided by racists and bigots in the \u201calt-right\u201d movement is \u201cgarbage.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is a mainstream conservative who wants to profoundly take on the left. The left is infuriated that anybody would challenge the legitimacy of their moral superiority. And so the left goes hysterical,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact is, you know, and you get this with all these smears of Steve Bannon. Steve Bannon is a naval officer. He was a managing partner at Goldman Sachs. He was \u2013 he was a Hollywood movie producer. You know, the idea that somehow he represents -- I had never heard of the alt-Right until the nutcakes started writing about it.\u201d As for Trump\u2019s agenda, Gingrich pointed to an interview Trump gave with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d -- in which he outlined his plan to deport 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes. \u201cWell, I think if you listen to the brief section you had from \u201860 Minutes,\u2019 there are going to be substantial deportations,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cThey\u2019re called criminals. I mean, 2 million people would be a lot of people to deport.\u201d  \u201cAnd if at the same time you gain control of the border, and if you pass a guest worker program, you\u2019d be a long way towards then three, or four, or five years from now dealing with the rest of the folks who are here without legal permission,\u201d Gingrich added. \u201cAnd I think by that stage we would have accommodated in some way.\u201d He said that whether Democrats who opposed his candidacy accept him as \u201clegitimate\u201d depends on whether those Democrats want the country to be \u201ca successful venture\u201d -- but said Trump shouldn\u2019t expect to get any help from the \u201chard left.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s a question of whether or not you want America to be a successful venture. And I think frankly if you\u2019re hard left, it\u2019s very hard to imagine why you\u2019re going to accommodate a Trump presidency,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, George W. Bush was attacked from day one by the hard left. Obama was attacked from day one by conservatives. We\u2019ve now been through 16 years of this siege warfare.\u201d Should Trump continue tweeting, something that has been central (and sometimes damaging) to his image as a candidate?  \u201cMy advice to that is to always have an editor,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201c... I mean, look, it\u2019s a technique for reaching 13 or 14 million people at no cost and gets him around the New York Times.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

While much of Trump\u2019s plan already exists as part of his general legislative agenda, it also includes policies specific to inner cities, where he would ramp up law enforcement and look to increase investments. \u201cWe will also have tax holidays for inner-city investment and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe will empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement.\u201d  The president-elect\u2019s plan comes just as anti-Trump protesters have filled major urban areas in recent days, crowding the streets with some resulting in violence.\u00a0 According to election exit polls, the president-elect fared poorly among black voters, garnering just 8 percent of African-American support.

If anything is going to break this streak now, it\u2019s the looming Federal Reserve monetary policy decision on Dec. 14.\u00a0 Last week, the Dow Jones industrials index gained 3.1 percent, the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.6 percent as big-tech stocks like Apple (AAPL) joined the fray and the Russell 2000 small-cap index climbed 5.6 percent to bring its total gain to 16 percent since the election.  Smaller stocks have been in the vanguard, thanks to their increased exposure to U.S. customers, who are expected to benefit most from Trump\u2019s economic policies. And financial stocks have been getting a lift from higher long-term interest rates, which boost profit margins for banks.  Both investors and consumers are in a \u201choneymoon\u201d period right now with Trump. In just over a month, after the inauguration, the realities of governing will hit -- and the ebullience will fade as contentious issues like the need to raise the federal debt ceiling in March and the drag on the deficit from higher interest rates become clear.  That isn\u2019t to say the uptrend won\u2019t march on into 2017 (chart below). Just that the euphoria should give way to reasoned analysis. Trump\u2019s efforts to clamp down on immigration and open-border trade deals will likely pinch corporate profitability. Plus, his fiscal plans, all else equal, would double the national debt and won\u2019t start coming into effect, according to Goldman Sachs, until 2018.  For now, however, none of that matters.  Overbought technical conditions, red-hot sentiment and stretched equity market valuations? Those don\u2019t matter either, but they\u2019re warning signs for those looking to extend their long positioning.  The Bespoke Investment Group noted that the S&P 500 is well over two standard deviations above its 50-day moving average. The latest Investors Intelligence survey showed investors with bullish sentiment increased to 58.8 percent, the third reading in the \u201cdanger zone\u201d and nearing the 60-percent-plus peak seen when the market was topping in mid-2014. And Goldman Sachs pointed out that the median S&P 500 company trades at the 98th percentile of historical valuations.  Investors couldn\u2019t care less. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, another $600 million flowed into stocks last week, while $1.2 billion was pulled out of bonds. Financial stocks enjoyed their 11th consecutive weekly inflow. Energy stocks enjoyed their largest inflow in a year.  The only remaining catalyst that could trip up stocks before year-end is the upcoming Fed policy announcement on Wednesday, widely expected to feature another 0.25 percent interest rate hike as well as fresh guidance showing an aggressive pace of hikes in 2017.  Heading into the New Year, Merrill Lynch analysts worry that risks will increase markedly for investors. Trouble could start as soon as February as short-term bonds sell off, joining in the weakness seen in long-term bonds. That would result in a \u201cbear flattening\u201d of the yield curve that ushers in an era of higher growth/higher interest rates that drives higher market volatility. And it raises the risk of a \u201cbust,\u201d a la 1987, 1994, 1998 and 2008 as the Fed is forced to quickly tighten policy to prevent runaway inflation.

            "article_content": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Gov. Nikki Haley has developed a national reputation as a racial conciliator who led the charge to bring down the Confederate flag at the Statehouse and guided South Carolina through one of its darkest moments, the massacre at a black church. Now the 44-year-old American-born daughter of Indian immigrants is about to take her role as the state\u2019s healer-in-chief to a world stage, as U.N. ambassador. On Wednesday, Haley became the first woman and first minority chosen by President-elect Donald Trump for his Cabinet. If the Senate confirms her, she could find herself in the awkward position of being the international voice for an administration that has belittled the United Nations, promised to build a wall along the Mexican border and endeared itself to the alt-right movement, even though Trump has repudiated such groups. Haley may have offered a glimpse Tuesday of how she will approach the job. \u201cFaith with action and kindness and love will always take us where we want to go,\u201d the Republican governor said at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, where a white man gunned down nine black parishioners in June 2015. Haley drew wide praise for her leadership after the attack, as she conveyed the state\u2019s grief and successfully led calls to bring down the Confederate flag that had flown on the Statehouse grounds for 54 years. The shootings were motivated by \u201cpure hate,\u201d she said then, and will \u201cforever change the way I live my life.\u201d On Tuesday, churches across the state honored Haley\u2019s request for prayer vigils amid the nearly simultaneous murder trials of the defendant in the church massacre and a white former police officer accused of fatally shooting a black motorist in the back. Her handling of the racially charged events bolstered her national image, said longtime GOP operative Richard Quinn. \u201cIt became a national example of how you can deal with racial issues peacefully,\u201d he said. Other crises Haley has grappled with over the past two years include historic flooding in 2015, an elementary school shooting last September, Hurricane Matthew last month and wildfires that continue to rage in the state\u2019s northwestern corner. \u201cThe one constant is when things we didn\u2019t understand happened, the action was people stood hand in hand and loved each other. They didn\u2019t look for someone to blame, or hate. They looked for someone to love and lift people up,\u201d she said Tuesday, in calling for the same approach as the trials and the disaster recovery play out. Born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa in rural Bamberg, South Carolina, Haley was raised a Sikh. She says she converted to Christianity before marrying her husband, Michael, in 1996. They have two children, ages 18 and 15. Haley has recalled that as a youngster, she and her sister were disqualified from the segregated Little Miss Bamberg Pageant because organizers couldn\u2019t figure out whether the girls should compete in the white or the black contest. She confronted religious slurs over her Sikh roots during her 2010 campaign. The second-term governor, who can\u2019t seek a third term, was a Trump critic during the White House campaign. She asked Americans to resist \u201cthe siren call of the angriest voices\u201d in how the nation treats immigrants. But she has also fought the Obama administration on both legal and illegal immigration. Last December, she asked that no Syrian refugees be relocated to South Carolina because of \u201cgaps in available intelligence\u201d on those fleeing the civil war. Haley, the second U.S. governor of Indian heritage, is the first South Carolina governor who is not a white man. She is also the nation\u2019s youngest governor. She brings limited international experience to one of the U.S. government\u2019s most important international assignments. Almost all of her exposure on the world stage has been in pursuit of luring jobs to South Carolina. Michelin, Bridgestone, Continental, Trelleborg and Giti Tire all have announced new or expanded operations in recent years, bolstering South Carolina\u2019s reputation as the nation\u2019s tire capital. Her trips abroad to lure jobs include a 2015 secretive trip to Sweden, which was followed weeks later by an announcement that Volvo would build its first U.S. auto plant in South Carolina in exchange for more than $200 million in state incentives. In 2014, Haley took an economic development trip to India, her first visit to her parents\u2019 native country since she was 2. Her parents emigrated from India in the early 1960s. Haley graduated from Clemson University in 1994 with an accounting degree. But she says her business experience started at age 13, when she became the bookkeeper of her family\u2019s clothing store, a job she returned to after college. In 2010, she was a three-term state House member, little known across the state. Still, Haley won the GOP primary for governor that year against a South Carolina congressman, an attorney general and a lieutenant governor. She prevailed in the general election and was easily re-elected four years later.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has yet to nominate an individual to lead the State Department -- and the pitch to be the highest-ranking Cabinet member has become public for some. Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus added some names to the list of contenders Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press:\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure who he\u2019s going to select, but I do know that he\u2019s talking to the right people: Giuliani, General Keane, General [John] Kelly; he\u2019s talked to Mitt Romney, obviously.\u201d\u00a0 CBS News has reported that one of the top contenders is Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, but other possible picks include 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former CIA Director David Petraeus, and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, among others. Here\u2019s an overview of some of the individuals who might be picked: Rudy Giuliani:\u00a0The\u00a0Trump ally\u00a0has made a public case for his appointment, arguing that his private sector experience makes him a strong candidate.  \u201cI probably have traveled in the last 13 years as much as Hillary did in the years she was secretary of state,\u201d Giuliani, referencing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Friday. \u201cMy knowledge of foreign policy is as good, or better, than anybody they\u2019re talking to.\u201d He told the Journal that he had visited as many as 80 foreign countries since leaving public office and taken 150 foreign trips. He has spent the last several years consulting on security issues around the world for a firm he founded, Giuliani Partners, and he also chaired the cyber security and crisis management practice at Greenberg Traurig, a major multinational lobbying law firm. Some of Giuliani\u2019s business ties to foreign governments and companies would likely be scrutinized during Senate confirmation. The ex-mayor, 72, was also a federal prosecutor in the Reagan administration. Giuliani\u2019s aggressive demeanor has some Republicans worried about how he would conduct himself on a world stage. On CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last week, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul criticized Giuliani for being \u201cunrepentant\u201d in supporting the Iraq war, and said he doesn\u2019t believe Giuliani is \u201cvery diplomatic.\u201d \u201cI think you want the chief diplomat to be diplomatic,\u201d said Paul, who has claimed he would vote against confirming Giuliani in the Senate if Mr. Trump nominated him. Mitt Romney: The former GOP presidential nominee has a history of clashing with the president-elect. Romney refused to endorse Mr. Trump during the Republican primary cycle, even actively and openly blasting the real estate mogul for his controversial rhetoric and policy stances.  Trump has also fired back against Romney, calling him a \u201clightweight losing candidate\u201d on Facebook and dubbing him \u00a0\u201cone of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics\u201d in a tweet.  But the two had a lengthy meeting at Bedminster which impressed Mr. Trump, and put him into \u201cactive and serious consideration\u201d for secretary of state. Kellyanne Conway, a senior transition team adviser and Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, weighed in over the Thanksgiving holiday about the possibility of Romney as chief diplomat, cautioning that the president-elect\u2019s supporters would not appreciate the choice.  One source told CBS News\u2019 Arden Farhi that he had received text messages from donors and allies who have warned against choosing Romney because he had been \u201cthrowing spears from the stand\u201d during the election cycle. \u00a0 David Petraeus: The president-elect has been giving serious consideration to Petraeus, whose resume includes his leadership of Central Command, his time as a retired Army general, and a stint as the former CIA director (a post he later resigned because of a scandal involving an extramarital affair and the improper handling of classified information, for which he was given two years probation and fined $100,000).  Petraeus\u2019 military background could fall in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to beef up American military strength abroad, and he has even called for a reexamination of restrictive U.S. rules of engagement when it comes to precision airstrikes.  Petraeus has also cautioned against putting boots on the ground with Iraqi forces when it comes to the fight against ISIS.  \u201cI would not, for example, embed U.S. personnel at the Iraqi battalion level, nor would I support clearance operations before a viable force is available,\u201d he said in an interview with \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d last year. Petraeus told BBC Radio 4 this week that if Mr. Trump appointed him to his Cabinet, \u201cthe only response can be: \u2018Yes, Mr. President.\u2019\u201d Bob Corker: The Tennessee senator, a Republican, is another possible candidate -- he currently chairs the Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee, where he led the Senate fight against President Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal.\u00a0 Corker, who served on Mr. Trump\u2019s national security advisory committee during the campaign cycle, has also disagreed at times with the president-elect. Corker was a key player in the 2013 comprehensive immigration bill that passed in the Senate, where he authored an amendment pushing for a border security surge. The overall legislative package has been unpopular with Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.\u00a0 The Tennessee Republican criticized Mr. Trump during the primary campaign for statements saying that President Obama founded the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, saying the outlandish statement was \u201ctaking the facts that took place in 2011 and carrying that far too far.\u201d Corker was also on Mr. Trump\u2019s shortlist to become vice president. Marine Gen. John Kelly (ret), the former head of the Southern Command, met with Mr. Trump on Sunday, and as mentioned, he was among the names Priebus brought up on Sunday. Kelly served for 45 years in the military and is widely respected. He is credited with helping wipe out al Qaeda in western Iraq, and he also served as a military adviser to Robert Gates when he was defense secretary. Kelly has opposed Mr. Obama on several fronts, including his efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. He has also scoffed at the idea that a Senate report on the CIA\u2019s use of torture on detainees meant that the U.S. had lost the high moral ground on human rights -- it was \u201cfoolishness,\u201d he told the Washington Post. In the last couple of years, as the push to allow women into combat roles intensified, the Marines opposed opening all ground combat jobs to women. They had conducted a study which concluded that mixed-gender units were less effective that all-male units. Asked about this in January, Kelly predicted that there would be pressure for future generals \u201cto lower standards because that\u2019s the only way it\u2019ll work in the way that I hear some people, particularly, the agenda-driven people here in Washington -- or in the land, the way they want it to work.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this article misstated how Sen. Bob Corker voted regarding the Iran nuclear deal. He voted against the deal.\u00a0",

A meeting of the National Policy Institute \u2013 an alt-right think tank \u2013 drew hundreds to the Ronald Reagan pavilion in Washington.\u00a0 Since 2008, the alt- or alternative-right movement lived mostly on obscure message boards online.\u00a0 It gained more attention after Donald Trump hired Steve Bannon to run his presidential campaign in August. \u00a0 Bannon\u2019s Breitbart website is, among other things, seen as the largest platform for the alt-right message\u00a0-- with more than 300 million views in the last month. Thirty-eight-year old Richard Spencer, who is president of the National Policy Institute, said he is enthusiastic about Bannon acting as the strategist for President-elect Donald Trump.\u00a0 \u201cBecause Breitbart has been an open place for a lot of ideas that I care about,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Bannon denies being alt-right. Its members are usually college-educated white males, with strong right-wing views. They are difficult to define because of the wide range of members \u2013 from those who believe that America will be great only when it looks out for itself, to those who believe in anti-immigration and white dominance.\u00a0 \u201cThey say instead of asking what\u2019s good for the world they ask what is good for us,\u201d explained Professor Thomas Main, a public policy professor at Baruch College in New York City. He has been following the movement for years.\u00a0 He said after the Great Recession, and with the country\u2019s increasing minority population, many white men began to feel left out of the political process. \u201cI think what happened is that all of those shocks to the system, in a lot of people, especially on the right say, \u2018gee our current way of thinking is not working for us, we need something new,\u2019\u201d said Main.\u00a0 What does Spencer say to people who call groups like his racist? \u201cThe word racist doesn\u2019t have any meaning anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically calling me a mean old guy.\u201d\u00a0 Does he discriminate against people because of the color of their skin? \u201cEveryone is discriminating in all sorts of things in terms of life,\u201d he said. \u201cI discriminate all the time \u2013 discriminating is living.\u201d\u00a0 Spencer said he opposes violence. He calls the election of Trump a step toward our new normal.",

            "article_content": "Wall Street roared back from the abyss on Wednesday in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s surprise electoral victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Overnight, equity futures had dropped several percent, echoing the Brexit chaos from June: An angry electorate out to punish the establishment was making markets recoil once again.  Yet the fear soon subsided. Trump\u2019s victory speech was conciliatory, Clinton conceded. And, most important for reversing the panic that set in on first blush, traders realized that if Trump\u2019s economic plans are enacted, they would amount to a huge fiscal stimulus of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, with a strong dose of deregulation for the financial industry and others. Equities soared, with the Dow Jones industrials index gaining 1.4 percent after testing new highs, thanks to big gains in bank stocks and other areas set to benefit from a Trump administration. The dollar surged. But a big sell-off in Treasury bonds, evidence of technical weakness, and a jump in long-term interest rates suggest challenges -- and ongoing market volatility -- lie ahead.  Treasury bonds were slammed on a spike in inflation expectations and chatter of official selling of U.S. bonds by the Chinese. Also, the December Federal Reserve interest rate hike seems to be on track as well. But that boosted financial stocks in a big way, up 4.1 percent as a group, on hopes that higher rates will lift loan profitability. \u00a0 Some health-care stocks were also strong on visions of a lighter regulatory burden on drugmakers and biotechs. The group gained 3.4 percent, with Pfizer (PFE) closing up 7.1 percent after trading even higher earlier in the session.  U.S. Steel (X) gained 17.2 percent, thanks to an analyst upgrade by Jefferies on post-election benefits from possible trade protectionism and increased infrastructure spending. Corrections Corp. of America (CXW) gained a whopping 43.1 percent as analysts noted possible higher demand if Trump tightens immigration enforcement. Clinton\u2019s defeat also removed the threat of her anti-private-prison stance. And Lockheed Martin (LMT) gained 6 percent on a general boost for defense stocks, thanks to Trump\u2019s clamoring for an upgrade to military hardware.  On the downside, emerging markets stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other yield-sensitive issues, and clean energy stocks underperformed.  Looking ahead, a lot remains in flux.\u00a0 Also, let\u2019s not forget that the first major policy challenge Trump will face is the need to raise the U.S. debt ceiling in March -- something that will focus attention on the deficit-raising consequences of his fiscal plans and put many Congressional Republican budget hawks in an awkward position.  Wednesday\u2019s flashy rebound in the stock market also masks underlying weakness because the rally was tainted by narrow participation. Incredibly, there were only 310 net advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange. That\u2019s down nearly 30 percent from Tuesday\u2019s modest rise on Wall Street. And it\u2019s well below the nearly 2,000 net advancing issues seen on Monday as markets surged in response to news the FBI had wrapped up its investigation into possible new emails related to Clinton\u2019s private server.  Complicating matters for investors amid all the uncertainty about Trump\u2019s policies is the fact that stocks are entering a time of seasonal strength (\u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d and all that).\u00a0 So until clarity on Trump\u2019s policy priorities emerges, the sell-off in T-bonds stabilizes, and the market fully digests the Fed\u2019s next rate hike, investors would do well to remain cautious. \u00a0 \u00a0 Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

            "article_content": "GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump delivered a huge electoral upset over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton with a surprisingly strong showing in \u201cRust Belt\u201d states thanks to his touting of economic nationalism to regions ravaged by the headwinds of free trade and globalization.\u00a0 Markets descended into chaos almost as soon as the close results from states like Florida, Ohio and North Carolina trickled in, sending Dow futures and Asian stock prices sharply lower as investors panicked over uncertainties on trade, immigration and geopolitical tensions. At one point, Dow futures plunged more than 4 percent and Japan\u2019s major index nosedived more than 6.1 percent, its largest drop in years. The Mexican peso likewise tumbled and investors looking for safe assets bid up the price of gold. Watch for a triggering of circuit breakers when U.S. markets open on Wednesday. The New York Stock Exchange\u2019s \u201cLevel 1\u201d breakers are hit on a 7 percent decline, which is a roughly 1,280-point drop for the Dow. It\u2019ll likely resemble the fallout from this past summer\u2019s Brexit all over again. Only bigger. And it\u2019ll likely continue.  Also crashing are the odds of the oft-teased December rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Assuming financial market pressure continues as New York markets open for business -- which is all but assured -- look for Fed officials to soothe nerves by downplaying chances of a policy tightening until financial market turmoil ends, as they did earlier this year in the wake of the Brexit uncertainty. Stepping back, the election result is a massive surprise (few pre-election polls showed Trump ahead in support) and a big electoral mandate for Republicans, who are on track to maintain control of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The last time Republicans held all three branches of power (White House, Senate and House) was in 1928 when California Republican Herbert Hoover beat New York Democrat Al Smith.  It will surely have major implications for the drivers of the stock market: Earnings, economic growth and interest rates, as well as investor sentiment. For the last year and a half, Democrats and many Republicans have been using scare tactics to warn of the consequences of Trump rising to the presidency. So, the near-term panic is likely to be acute and powerful.  This is made worse by the technical fragility of the stock market: The Dow has been flirting with the 18,000 level since 2014, corporate earnings have been falling for a year-and-a-half, and the economy is tepidly running just above stall speed. The Russell 2000 small-cap stock index returned last week to levels not seen since early July before rebounding.  What comes after will depend, in large part, on Trump himself in the days and weeks to come. Who will be his cabinet picks? What tone does he set with China and Mexico on trade policies and his border wall? Will he reconcile with Fed chairman Janet Yellen? And let\u2019s not forget that Trump\u2019s economic policies amount to a massive fiscal stimulus since they would add to the national debt, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. This could be a much-needed boost to the economy, as tax cuts and infrastructure spending lift GDP growth.  Time will tell. But for now, wild market swings are likely as investors and traders respond to the world\u2019s largest democracy delivering a massive shock to the political and economic establishment.

            "article_content": "NEW YORK CITY -- Throngs of people supporting immigrant rights took to the streets in protest Sunday, just as mass deportation plans from President-elect Donald Trump were revealed during his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. The marches began in Manhattan on Sunday largely to protest against Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win, but the focus was on his immigration plans. More than 1,000 people joined the march that started mid-afternoon and extended into the evening. Demonstrators were holding signs in English and Spanish, saying things like \u201cHate won\u2019t make us great.\u201d They\u2019re chanting, \u201cWe are here to stay.\u201d Organizers have said they\u2019re speaking out against Trump\u2019s support of deportation and other measures. The areas surrounding the president-elect\u2019s Midtown home has become like a fortress, with the Secret Service and NYPD going to extremes to protect the future president, CBS New York reported. Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s most reliable surrogates, said protesters around the nation are exaggerating the fear of a Trump presidency. The former New York City mayor said he wishes that Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic presidential nominee, and President Barack Obama would say something to the protesters. \u201cI just hope it calms down,\u201d Giuliani said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Giuliani said the protesters should respect the democratic process and calls them \u201ckind of like professional protesters.\u201d Mostly, the demonstrations were peaceful. However, in Portland, Oregon, a man was shot and wounded Saturday morning during a confrontation. Police arrested two teenagers. Police in Portland say they arrested a total of 71 people late Saturday and early Sunday during the anti-Donald Trump protests downtown.  In a news release Sunday, the Portland Police Bureau said the protesters failed to obey numerous lawful orders to vacate city streets. Most were cited for disorderly conduct and failing to obey an officer.  The bureau called in a public transit bus to transport the arrested to the central police precinct for processing.  Police said protesters repeatedly threw road flares and bottles at officers and that a police sport-utility vehicle was tagged with graffiti. Several hundred protesters Sunday marched around Philadelphia\u2019s City Hall and then down Market Street to Independence Mall, carrying signs and chanting \u201cDonald Trump has got to go!\u201d and \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d In Los Angeles, a few hundred people gathered outside CNN\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters, and in San Francisco, hundreds of people, including many families with children, marched from Golden Gate Park to Ocean Beach chanting \u201cLove trumps hate!\u201d On Saturday, an estimated 8,000 marched through downtown.\u00a0 On Sunday, about 800 people marched through the state capital of Sacramento and hundreds others formed a human chain around the nearly 3.5-mile perimeter of Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt. Rallies in Oakland have at times become unruly, but those who came to the lake held hands and chanted, \u201cWe reject the president-elect.\u201d\u00a0 Demonstrations also took place internationally. On Saturday, a group of Mexicans at statue representing independence in Mexico City expressed their concerns about a possible wave of deportations. One school teacher said it would add to the \u201cunrest\u201d that\u2019s already in Mexico. About 300 people protested Trump\u2019s election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy near the landmark Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. On Saturday, demonstrators gathered in big cities like New York and Los Angeles, as well as in smaller places like Worcester, Massachusetts, and Iowa City, Iowa.",

Are you really going to build a wall?  DONALD TRUMP: Yes.  LESLEY STAHL: You\u2019re-- you know, they are talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?  DONALD TRUMP: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I\u2019m very good at this, it\u2019s called construction.  LESLEY STAHL: So part wall, part fence?  DONALD TRUMP: \u2013there could be some fencing.  LESLEY STAHL: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?  DONALD TRUMP: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have  criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these  people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are  getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But  we\u2019re getting them out of our country, they\u2019re here illegally. After the  border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to  make a determination on the people that they\u2019re talking about who are  terrific people, they\u2019re terrific people but we are gonna make a  determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley,  it\u2019s very important, we are going to secure our border.",

            "article_content": "I would love to join the chorus and say my jaw dropped when it was becoming apparent that Donald Trump was going to win on Election Night.  But the truth is that I still haven\u2019t picked it up from when Trump gave out Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s phone number in South Carolina (July 21st, 2015).  Or when he went on a long screed against Ben Carson, which culminated in him inviting an audience member to stab him and then asking how \u201cstupid\u201d the voters of Iowa are (November 21st, 2015).  Or when he repeated an audience member calling Sen. Ted Cruz a \u201cp**sy\u201d in New Hampshire in front of thousands (February 8th, 2016).  My mouth is still (hopefully not permanently) agape from when Trump called a statement by Pope Francis \u201cdisgraceful\u201d in South Carolina (February 18th, 2016). In that instance, I actually let out a gasp. It wasn\u2019t the first time. It certainly wasn\u2019t the last.  For visual evidence of my shocked face, see Trump\u2019s Facebook Live video on October 9th before the second general election debate. Trump shocked the nation when he held a news conference with Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers of alleged sexual misconduct through the decades.  As reporters filed in, there was my face, once the realization dawned on me as to what was happening, with eyes popping as if we had reached the peak action scene of Looney Tunes episode featuring Daffy Duck. \u00a0 I have this journal I\u2019ve kept since the beginning of the campaign. The first entry was before Trump announced. It has my weight. It was the first time I had weighed myself in awhile and I aimed to stay in shape on the trail. While I won\u2019t give you the specific number, I will say that following the number, my journal entry says \u201cYikes!\u201d  Let\u2019s leave aside whether a year and half of being on the road with only sporadic trips to the gym and never turning down that bag of chips helps with that. The first Trump-related entry was on July 16th, 2015. Trump gave a speech in Laconia, New Hampshire. The entry reads, \u201cSweltering hot\u2026room packed to the brim...\u201d Then there was Trump, unfiltered and with no teleprompter aiming a Trump-Tower sized verbal cannon at\u2026everything. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the problem with politicians,\u201d he said, voice rising. He controlled the room with an almost preacher-like quality. \u201cThat\u2019s all they do is debate. They go up. They debate. They\u2019re all talk. They\u2019re no action. Nothing happens ever! Nothing happens!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe have a president that doesn\u2019t have a clue!\u201d \u201cI have an expression. We have lots of expressions in this group, that I can tell you. Right? But I have an expression. The American dream is dead but I\u2019m going to make it better and bigger and stronger.\u201d \u201cWe need leadership that\u2019s smart! We have to bring back our jobs! We have to bring back our manufacturing from many countries! We don\u2019t make any good deals.\u201d  \u201cRemember, the silent majority is back. And don\u2019t forget it. This is the silent majority!\u201d Trump walked off stage. My journal reads, \u201cTrump mobbed on way out of the room...as if he was Paul McCartney from the Beatles in the 1960\u2019s. Maybe he is for GOP.\u201d When Trump said the \u201csilent majority\u201d is back, many scoffed. I think back to that Laconia rally and I wonder if Trump truly knew about what the fervency of his support \u2013 or what the media spectacle would be for the entirety of the campaign. I certainly didn\u2019t. The funny thing is that for the last 18 months, as the campaign reporter assigned to cover Trump for CBS, I have spent more time in the same room as Trump other than his own staff and family. But in that time, I never got to know the guy. I never found out what made him tick. I never had a full conversation with him, beyond press conferences or the occasional hello. He never hung out with his traveling press. The only time he would even acknowledge reporters was to call us dishonest at every turn at rallies and to turn crowds against us. One personal interaction I did have with him did give me some insight into who Trump was as a person. I just didn\u2019t realize it at the time. A couple weeks after Laconia, during a hot summer morning, a mass of cameras, journalists and bemused pedestrians crowded outside 60 Centre Street - New York\u2019s State Supreme Court. The court officer that\u2019s patrolled the court for almost forty years said he had never seen anything like this. I was there for CBS. A woman walked by a group of us -- when we were already irritated and drowning in sweat -- and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything better to do?\u201d I wish I could time-warp back to that woman and say, \u201cLady, you have\u00a0no\u00a0idea.\u201d A photographer snapped back: \u201cYou stop watching this stuff, we\u2019ll stop taking pictures.\u201d Any second now, Trump was about to show up for jury duty. A woman walking out of the courtroom shook her head and muttered, \u201cThis isn\u2019t news. This is b******t.\u201d Trump was supposed to show up at 9:00 a.m., but pulled up in a stretch limo about seven minutes late. His long-time driver, Eddie Diaz, said that the car ran into some traffic on the way down. The limo pulled up to the court and out popped the future president-elect. Trump was instantly mobbed by cameras and reporters shouted questions at him. \u201cWill you deport 11 million undocumented immigrants?\u201d \u201cAre you excited for jury duty?\u201d Trump slowly and deliberately walked up the courthouse steps. He soaked in the media attention - occasionally throwing glib, one-sentence responses to ravenous reporters ready to gobble up any and all sound bites. I was stationed near the courthouse door. I was part of the pack - yelling questions. Trump, ever the showman, knew we needed to get our shots. He would stop occasionally to make sure. Trying to get the coolest kid in the area to pay attention was something I had done my whole life without success. As Trump got near my camera, he closed his eyes and flashed a thumbs up to my lens. Two men who wanted to get Trump to sign a dollar bill. They told me it could sell for $200 on Ebay. Trump came out and took a lunch break, still being mobbed by cameras on the way in and out. On his way back in, I asked him how he would feel about getting picked for a jury. He paused, weighing whether to grace me with a precious sound bite. He turned to me and said, \u201cIf it happens, it happens.\u201d \u201cIf it happens, it happens,\u201d was, in one way, the most banal phrase ever invented by man. It is a close relative of \u201cIt is what it is\u201d and \u201cBoth teams played hard, man.\u201d But on the other hand, it sums of the Trump candidacy in five words. Trump campaigned\u00a0his way, consequences be damned.  There was never a pivot to appeal to the masses. But he didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 It was the Trump mindset. He could go to war with Fox News. He could insult veterans who were prisoners of war. He could propose a giant wall across the Southern border that would cost hundreds of billions of dollars - and then claim Mexican government would pay for it - and still be impervious to political gravity. Should Ukraine join NATO? This is what Trump told Meet The Press on August 16th, 2015: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care. If [Ukraine] goes in, great. If it doesn\u2019t go in, great.\u201d Hundreds of rallies later, I find myself thinking back to that Laconia rally and jury duty as very indicative of what the Trump candidacy would be like: The preacher-like bombast, and the swagger of his walk up the steps.\u00a0 And it worked. Now, there is no \u201cIf it happens, it happens.\u201d It happened. Trump is now the president-elect. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one I\u2019d even consider,\u201d 69-year-old Kit Carson, a lifelong Newport Beach resident once told me at a rally at the USS Iowa in Los Angeles, California more than a year ago. \u201cOur politicians are coercive crooks who live off of you and me.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMight as well not even be anybody else,\u201d said Bradley Herring, a 26-year-old firefighter I met at a rally in Franklin, Tennessee. He drove almost 10 hours to come see Trump. \u201cNot a politician, he\u2019s a businessman. He\u2019s rich. If he can build a billionaire empire, he can build a rich country.\u201d I met many people on the trail that agreed with Carson and Herring, the ones that thought Trump would change everything because he wasn\u2019t a politician. \u201cIt\u2019s like reading a book. How many times do you have to read\u00a0Gone With The Wind\u00a0before you know what happens?\u201d said 68-year-old Jane Williams at a rally in Richmond, Virginia. \u201cYou hear what they have to say. Canned, heard it before.\u201d In some respects, Trump had the election won just by announcing he was running, by sheer virtue of not being anybody else. But there was also a genuine, visceral dislike of Hillary Clinton. One interaction that always stands out to me was with a man named Sandy Woodmansee, a construction supervisor, who lives in Epping, New Hampshire.  He was volunteering for Trump at a rally in Keene in September, 2015. Woodmansee had a grizzled, white beard with a thick New England accent. He was sporting a buzz cut, a grey polo and shorts. He was a fast talker and his job was to patrol the parking lot. \u201cSTOP. YER NAWT ALLOWED TO BE IN HE-UH,\u201d he would say to drivers who had gone astray. No one needs a moat when you had Woodmansee. I asked Woodmansee why he had decided to volunteer for Trump. \u201cI was laying in bed, trying to sleep, and I don\u2019t know why, but I thought of the Clintons being back in the White House and it absolutely appalled. The very next day I volunteered to assist Donald Trump.\u201d Months later, Trump would have his first victory in New Hampshire, crushing the competition. Woodmansee spotted me across the room, walked up to me, grabbed me by the face and plopped a big kiss on my cheek. He then walked away without saying a word.\u00a0 There went my jaw again. Trump rallies were like political Woodstock for his supporters. People would drive for hours, stay overnight in front of an arena to get a good seat, dress up in costume and cry during their favorite Trump policy proposal. One time, at a rally in Las Vegas, I watched a man literally bow down to Trump when he was on stage. At that same speech, Lisa Mains, a Dutch immigrant who came to the United States in 1966, said to me, \u201cThe reason I\u2019m here? Support the only hope for America. As far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s God\u2019s gift to this country right now.\u201d I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the difficulty of covering Trump as one of the few minority reporters on the road full time covering him. Oftentimes, I found myself as one of the only people of color in the sea of thousands at Trump rallies. One time, at a speech in Reno, I was asked if I was a member of ISIS. This came weeks after another Trump supporter interrupted an interview to tell me to go back to Iraq where I came from. While I was discussing whether to get security or not, I was heartened when another Trump supporter, appalled by what he had just witnessed, had already went to find a security guard.  However, I was then subsequently disheartened when I told a Trump staffer what happened, and the staffer said that my situation was analogous to Trump being called a Nazi by the press. It wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 No matter what the future brings, covering Trump from the start to finish of his campaign will be unlike any other experience I will ever have. His supporters showed similar dedication to their candidate that long-suffering Cubs fans have for decades before their team finally won. I once asked 52-year-old Kurt Schnable, from Marengo, Illinois, if Trump could ever lose his support. Schnable drove more than 200 miles to Burlington, Iowa to hear Trump speak. \u201cThat would be very difficult,\u201d Schnable said. \u201cBought the cap last week.\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Reince Priebus, the outgoing Republican National Committee chair, defended Donald Trump Sunday over the president-elect\u2019s charge last week, presented without proof, that \u201cmillions\u201d of people had voted illegally during the general election.  \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host John Dickerson pressed Priebus on that specific illegal vote claim, asking the incoming White House chief of staff how he handles the president-elect\u2019s statement \u201cwhen you know that that\u2019s not true.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s not true, John,\u201d Priebus said, saying that \u201cthere are estimates all over the map\u201d on undocumented immigrants voting in election.  \u201cBut you think millions of people voted illegally?\u201d Dickerson asked.  Priebus\u2019 response: \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d When the \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host pushed back, saying \u201cthere is not evidence that it happened in millions of votes in California,\u201d Priebus defended the president-elect once more.  \u201cI think the president-elect is someone who has pushed the envelope and caused people to think in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not taking conventional thought -- on every single issue and has caused people to look at things that maybe they have taken for granted.\u201d  Priebus then pointed to another issue Mr. Trump brought up last week: whether people burning the American flag should suffer consequences.  \u201cYou watch the news media and they say, well it\u2019s constitutional,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cWell, right. It is constitutional, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a subject for debate and discussion for the Supreme Court to revisit down the road.\u201d Priebus also weighed in on the increasingly public feud over one contender for the secretary of state position: Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts governor and a one-time Republican presidential nominee.  \u201cI think that Governor Romney is very talented,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what really we should look at is that we\u2019ve got a president here in Donald Trump that wants to look at the best and brightest of America regardless regardless of background, regardless of past disputes that we may have had with each other... that is the past.\u201d Over the weekend, Mr. Trump drew criticism over a phone call he had with Taiwanese leader Tsai Ying-wen, breaking with U.S. foreign policy protocol and becoming the first president or president-elect to officially speak with Taiwan\u2019s president since 1979.  Priebus said Trump \u201cknew exactly what was happening\u201d and that the call was a brief, two-minute \u201ccongratulatory call.\u201d  \u201cLook, we\u2019ve got a lot of problems to solve in this country and we\u2019re not going to solve them by just, you know, making believe that people don\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cHe talked to [Chinese] President Xi over two weeks ago, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be willing to talk to him again. This is not a massive deviation of our policy, but President(-elect) Trump has made it clear that he is going to work with China -- PRC -- to make sure that we have a better deal, that we have better trade agreements, and that we do a better job in protecting the American worker and he\u2019s going to continue to do it.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 In another break with precedent, Mr. Trump was also reportedly foregoing daily intelligence briefings, according to a Washington Post report last month. Priebus, however, said the briefings were \u201chappening quite frequently.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about every day,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cI think those are just going to ramp up as we get closer to January 20th.\u201d  When pressed specifically about how many times Mr. Trump has received them, the incoming chief of staff replied: \u201cHe\u2019s certainly informed, he\u2019s getting briefed. It feels like every day. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s every day, but it\u2019s a lot.\u201d Asked more generally about Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership style and whether the president-elect was influenced most by the last person he spoke with, Priebus pushed back on that notion.  \u201cI think that what he is is someone who likes to listen to different opinion[s],\u201d Priebus said, but that ultimately, \u201cin the end, once he formulates his opinion, once he decides this is where we\u2019re going to go, he pulls the trigger and he moves.\u201d \u00a0",

            "article_content": "On Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump set off a political firestorm when he claimed, in a series of tweets, that he lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton because \u201cmillions\u201d of people voted illegally in the 2016 election. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally Mr. Trump\u2019s argument -- which came in the wake of a three-state recount effort initiated by Green Party candidate Jill Stein -- has been debunked by fact-checkers across the internet, including Politifact (which rated his claims \u201cPants on Fire\u201d), the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker blog and Snopes. \u201cSimply put, there is no evidence that \u201cmillions of people\u201d voted illegally in the election,\u201d the Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler wrote. So where is Mr. Trump getting his information? Asked about this issue on the daily transition call, Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller cited two sources for Mr. Trump\u2019s claims: a 2014 Washington Post article about non-citizen voting, and a 2012 Pew Research Center study that said one in eight voter registrations in the U.S. are no longer valid. \u201cSo all of these are studies and examples of where there have been issues of both voter fraud and illegal immigrants voting,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if this much attention and oxygen is going to be given to complete frivolous, throw away fundraising scheme[s] by someone like Jill Stein, then there should be actual substantive looks at the overall examples of voter fraud, illegal immigrants voting in recent years.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time both the 2014 Post story and the 2012 Pew study have gotten a mention this election cycle: back before Election Day, when Mr. Trump was warning his rallies of widespread voter fraud, these were the two stories he cited. Both were criticized at the time as insufficient proof. The Washington Post study he refers to, published in an October 2014 article titled \u201cCould non-citizens decide the November election,\u201d was not actually conducted by the newspaper -- it was a guest post by two professors from Old Dominion University who had just written a scholarly article on the topic. The two professors, Jesse Richman and David Earnest, used figures from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) in 2008 and 2010 to suggest that non-citizen voting is more widespread than people think. According to their research, 14 percent of non-citizens said in the survey data that they were registered to vote. However, the Post article was roundly criticized -- and Richman\u2019s and Earnest\u2019s methodology appeared to be dubious enough that the Post affixed a note at the top the article saying another article claimed the study\u2019s findings \u201cwere biased and that the authors\u2019 data do not provide evidence of non-citizen voting.\u201d The story was also published more than two years ago, and thus, it makes no claims about specific instances of non-citizen voting in 2016. As for the second source Miller cited, the 2012 Pew study, the study found that approximately 24 million voter registrations, or roughly one in eight, are either inaccurate no longer valid. Additionally, the study said 1.8 dead people are still listed as voters, and 2.75 million people are registered in more than one state. One of the authors of the Pew study, David Becker, tweeted Monday that Mr. Trump and his team were misrepresenting the findings of the study, though: while it did prove that the voter rolls contain names they shouldn\u2019t, their study included no concrete findings or conclusions about voter fraud.\u201d \u201cAs primary author of the report the Trump camp cited today, I can confirm that report made no findings re: voter fraud,\u201d Becker tweeted. There is a claim that three million undocumented immigrants voted illegally in 2016. This appears to have been originally published on InfoWars.com, the website run by radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.  The three million figure seems to have originated with a Republican self-described voter fraud expert, Gregg Phillips, whose Twitter bio says he works for an organization called VoteFraud.org. However, VoteFraud.org redirects to a website at the URL electionnightgatekeepers.com, which contains no evidence relating to non-citizen voting. Shen journalists began asking Phillips for his data, he said it was still being analyzed -- and he declined to make any information or evidence available. \u201cNo. We will release it in open form to the American people,\u201d he responded on Twitter to one reporter. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow the media to spin this first. Sorry.\u201d For their part, government and election officials have all denied that there is any issue with widespread non-citizen voting.  In another tweet Sunday, Mr. Trump suggested voter fraud had occurred in three states that he lost: California, New Hampshire and Virginia: Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! Officials in all three states disputed Mr. Trump\u2019s claims, saying there was no evidence whatsoever of widespread voter fraud. In California, Secretary of State Alex Padilla said Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation are \u201cabsurd.\u201d \u201cIt appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him,\u201d Padilla said in a statement Sunday night. \u201cHis unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a President-elect.\u201d In New Hampshire, Senior Deputy Secretary of State David M. Scanlan, who runs the state\u2019s Election Division, said their office had received a small number of complaints but nothing beyond the usual number they get in an election cycle. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication of anything that widespread taking place in New Hampshire,\u201d he said, according to the New Hampshire Union Leader. \u201cIf he has evidence he should pass it along so we can act on it.\u201d And in Virginia, Gov. Terry McAuliffe said there was no reported voter fraud in the state and that Mr. Trump should \u201cput proof behind\u201d his allegations. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, too, said in Monday\u2019s press briefing that there has been \u201cno evidence produced to substantiate\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s claim. \u201cI think there is a difference between unfounded claims of fraud and a conscientious interpretation of the recount law that is consistent with the rules that Democrats and Republicans alike apply in a situation where there\u2019s a narrow victory by one candidate or the other,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "VIENNA \u2014 Austria denied its far-right party the presidency on Sunday, electing the Green Party\u2019s Alexander Van der Bellen over the Freedom Party\u2019s Norbert Hofer.  Amid growing fears about broad victories for far-right populism across Europe, Van der Bellen\u2019s victory will be seen as a sign of hope that similar movements can be defeated at the ballot box in other European countries next year.  Early results released Sunday evening in Austria, just after the polls had closed, found Van der Bellen with a 7-point lead over Hofer \u2013 far higher than any pre-election polls had suggested.  Hofer conceded the race shortly after the first results were released, thanking supporters in a Facebook post and calling for unity.  \u201cI congratulate Alexander Van der Bellen on his success and ask all Austrians to stay together and work together,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are all Austrians, no matter who the voters have chosen.\u201d Had Austria chosen Hofer on Sunday, the country would have elected the first far-right head of state in Europe since World War II. Hofer, who campaigned on an \u201cAustria first\u201d platform, is staunchly anti-refugee and has suggested Austria could hold a referendum on European Union membership.  At a time when voters distrust the political establishment and made it clear they were looking for a fresh face, Van der Bellen argued for making changes within the existing system, rather than trying to \u201cdestroy things\u201d outright. Unlike Hofer, he believes Austria should remain in the EU and has spoken about its importance. \u201cWe know that things need to change \u2013 but let\u2019s not destroy things,\u201d he said at his final rally on Friday. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to demolish the house because a couple of windows have become loose.\u201d  Van der Bellen\u2019s election is still historic in its own right, and reflects Austrian voters\u2019 anti-establishment sentiment in a different way: this is the first time in more than 50 years that Austria\u2019s president did not come from the two major parties, the center-left Social Democrats or the center-right Austrian People\u2019s Party.  Sunday\u2019s election brings to a close an unusually long election campaign in Austria, and confirms election results from earlier this year: Van der Bellen initially won a May election against Hofer by about 31,000 votes, but the country\u2019s constitutional court annulled the results after suggestions of voting irregularities. The court called for a re-vote which was ultimately not held until this weekend in early December, more than six months later. In order to overcome his critics, Hofer had repeatedly attempted to assure voters he was not as extreme as had been suggested.  \u201cI am just a normal guy,\u201d he told reporters after his final rally in Vienna Friday. \u201cI am not far-right.\u201d \u00a0 Van der Bellen, however, had framed the election as Europe\u2019s first line of defense against the far-right. He called Mr. Trump\u2019s election in the U.S. a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Austria and for Europe more broadly, calling on voters across the continent to look for common ground and band together. \u201cI don\u2019t want Austria to become the first western European nation where right-wing demagogues take power,\u201d he said at a November news conference. Defeating Hofer in Austria is only the first step in many for those who wish to keep the far-right out of power in Europe: several high-profile elections in 2017 will give similar forces an opportunity to increase their influence at the ballot box.  In March, the Netherlands votes in parliamentary elections, where Dutch Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders has a chance at becoming the next prime minister. France votes for its next president in April and May, with the National Front\u2019s Marine Le Pen poised to make it to the final round against Republican candidate Francois Fillon.  And in Germany, which votes next fall, Chancellor Angela Merkel is running for a fourth term but faces strong backlash over her policy on admitting refugees to Germany \u2013 an issue the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) has capitalized on in an effort to win seats in the German parliament.

            "article_content": "VIENNA -- Norbert Hofer of Austria\u2019s right-wing Freedom Party, narrowly lost the country\u2019s presidential election last May to Alexander Van der Bellen, a more mainstream, pro-Europe candidate. But a court nullified the results after reports of irregularities, and a new election has been set for Sunday. Founded by a former Nazi officer, the Freedom Party campaigned hard on an anti-immigrant platform. That hasn\u2019t changed, but what has is the U.S. election. \u201cThe Trump factor is here,\u201d said political commentator Thomas Hofer. He said Donald Trump\u2019s win has emboldened Austria\u2019s right wing. \u201cYou see huge parallels; the wall on the southern border is well and alive here in Austria as an issue, anti-immigrant message, anti-establishment message,\u201d he said. There are overlapping tactics too, including fake news. False stories have spread online that claim Van der Bellen has cancer. \u201cIt\u2019s about undermining, not only undermining the message of the other side, but also spreading news, fake news,\u201d Thomas Hofer said. In May, CBS News correspondent Seth Doane went on the campaign trail with Freedom Party boss Wolfgang Jung, and got a taste of his anti-Auslim rhetoric. \u201cI don\u2019t want a mosque here,\u201d Jung said at the time. Now, Jung is saying that momentum is on their side. \u201cAfter Trump\u2019s surprise win your candidate said, \u2018Hey, we can do this too,\u2019\u201d Doane said. \u201cYes, and I hope so!\u201d Jung replied. This election is not just about Austria. The far right in France is watching, as is Germany, the country that has taken in the most refugees. Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing a growing threat from an ultra-nationalist, anti-immigrant party.",

            "article_content": "VIENNA\u00a0-- In the wake of the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the United States, far-right parties across Europe are eyeing other countries on the map where their newly energized movement could win at the ballot box. Austria, which holds its presidential election Sunday, is among the first to test the staying power of right-wing populism in Europe: if polls here are right, the country is poised to elect Europe\u2019s first far-right head of state since World War II.\u00a0 The results could have far-reaching implications for politics beyond Austria\u2019s borders \u2013 and signal further far-right victories in a half-dozen countries with elections slated for 2017. Norbert Hofer, the 45-year-old candidate for the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, holds a narrow but consistent lead in the polls over Green Party candidate Alexander Van der Bellen heading into the final stretch. Hofer has much in common with other far-right leaders across Europe, like Marine Le Pen in France and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands: Campaigning on a platform of \u201cputting Austria first,\u201d he is staunchly anti-refugee, has said he favors a referendum vote on European Union membership and claimed Islam \u201chas no place in Austria.\u201d Still, for his part, Hofer has repeatedly rejected the label of \u201cfar-right,\u201d working to assure voters and journalists alike that he is not what his opponents make him out to be. Asked by a journalist after his final rally in Vienna whether Europe should \u201cfear\u201d him as president, Hofer said no. \u201cI am just a normal guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not far-right.\u201d Van der Bellen, meanwhile, said Mr. Trump\u2019s election in the U.S. is a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Austria and its European neighbors, calling for European countries to band together \u2013 and suggesting Austria could help trigger far-right victories elsewhere if voters don\u2019t reject Hofer. \u201cI don\u2019t want Austria to become the first western European nation where right-wing demagogues take power,\u201d Van der Bellen said at a November news conference. Sunday\u2019s election follows more than six months of uncertainty over who would next lead Austria: Hofer and Van der Bellen initially faced off last May in a second-round vote that was supposed to determine the next president.\u00a0 Van der Bellen won that contest narrowly, by just 31,000 votes -- however, Austria\u2019s constitutional court annulled the results after evidence of voting irregularities and called for a revote. The new election was then scheduled for early October, but an issue with the glue on Austria\u2019s ballots forced Austrian officials to push the election date back to December. As Europe heads into 2017, Austria is just the beginning when it comes to the potential for far-right political gains at the ballot box. In March, the Netherlands votes in parliamentary elections, where Dutch Freedom Party leader Wilders has a chance at becoming the next prime minister. Then France votes for its next president in April and May, with the National Front\u2019s Le Pen poised to make it to the final round against Republican candidate Francois Fillon.\u00a0 And in neighboring Germany, which votes next fall, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing strong backlash to her policy on admitting refugees to Germany. The far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) has worked to capitalize on anti-refugee sentiment in the country, and its victories in several state elections over the course of 2016 means the party is likely to win seats in the German parliament. Both candidates held final rallies in Vienna on Friday, making their final pitch to voters. Hofer, who spoke at Vienna\u2019s old stock exchange Friday morning, framed the election as an opportunity to revitalize Austria. His message has been compared to that of Mr. Trump, who promised to \u201cMake America Great Again;\u201d Hofer wants Austrians to be \u201cproud again.\u201d \u201cAustrian men and Austrian women have a strong will to succeed \u2013 to make this country a success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old dust has to be shaken off and we will be proud again to be Austrian.\u201d And Van der Bellen urged voters to work within the existing system to change things, rather than give in to a desire to \u201cdestroy things.\u201d \u201cWe know that things need to change \u2013 but let\u2019s not destroy things,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026You don\u2019t need to demolish the house because a couple of windows have become loose.\u201d\u00a0 In Vienna on Saturday, just one day before Election Day here, things were mostly quiet on the political front: Van der Bellen volunteers handed out flyers and bags of Van der Bellen-branded fruit snacks Saturday evening in front of the city\u2019s famous Christmas market at the Rathaus (city hall). Earlier in the day, an anti-Hofer group staged a small march through part of the city, chanting, \u201cAnti-fascist!\u201d and \u201cDown with the Freedom Party!\u201d\u00a0 Many of the protesters in the march \u2013 which were not affiliated with Van der Bellen\u2019s campaign \u2013 held signs that read, \u201cNo Nazis in the Hofburg,\u201d referring to the residence of the president. One protester held up a Hillary Clinton campaign sign saying, \u201cLove trumps hate,\u201d one of the campaign\u2019s most-used phrases this year. Michael Sumasgutner, a 21-year-old who recently switched his support to Van der Bellen after voting previously for Hofer, said membership in the EU is one of the most important issues to him \u2013 and that Hofer\u2019s position on the issue was a big part of the reason he changed his mind. \u201cI think it\u2019s important Austria stays in the EU because it\u2019s a good connection,\u201d he said. Still, he said, he understands the underlying frustration with the status quo that has drawn many Austrians -- including young voters -- to Hofer and his message of change and prosperity. \u201cThere are many problems in this country: like there are no jobs, the economy is not growing, issues of culture,\u201d he said. He added that many voters feel that \u201cthe other parties are not working on the issues enough -- people are more attracted by the Freedom Party and want someone else in charge.\u201d Indeed, Sunday\u2019s result will be historic on that front: it will be the first time in more than half a decade that the presidency is not held by a member of the center-right party (the Austrian People\u2019s Party) or the center-left party (the Social Democrats). Hofer\u2019s supporters praised him as a defender of Austria and its national identity, saying he will bring the needed change to the country. \u201cI think he\u2019s the better president for us \u2013 he\u2019s for Austrians,\u201d said Manfred Dvorak, 54, of Vienna. He added that using the \u201cNazi\u201d label for Hofer, as the candidate\u2019s opponents have done, is \u201cstupid.\u201d \u201cWhen people run out of arguments, then there\u2019s always this Nazi [accusation],\u201d he said. David Heuser, 25, marched Saturday with the anti-Hofer crowd -- but said he ultimately believes Hofer will win the election. \u201cI fear that [Van der Bellen] will lose tomorrow \u2026 and that the right wing candidate will win,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he does, we will protest against him.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "ATHENS, Greece President Obama brought a message of reassurance to Greece -- even so, the questions that faced him at a news conference in Athens with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras were dominated by the recent election of Donald Trump. In response to a question about whether he realized there was anger in the American populace before the election, the president said, \u201cOf course I did.\u201d But he acknowledged that the candidacies of both Democrat Bernie Sanders and of Donald Trump were able to tap into the anger and fear of many Americans. \u201cWhen you see a Donald Trump and a Bernie Sanders -- very unconventional candidates -- have considerable success, then obviously there\u2019s something there that\u2019s being tapped into,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cA suspicion of globalization. A desire to rein in its excesses. A suspicion of elites and governing institutions that people feel may not be responsive to their immediate needs. And that sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity. And that can be a volatile mix.\u201d President Obama said that world leaders need to pay heed to people\u2019s very real fears of economic dislocation and inequality in the midst of globalization. \u201cThe more aggressively and effectively we deal with those issues, the less those fears may channel themselves into counterproductive approaches that can pit people against each other,\u201d Obama said as he opened the last foreign tour of his presidency. The president said that both Trump\u2019s election and the British vote to leave the European Union reflected the need to deal with \u201cpeople\u2019s fears that their children won\u2019t do as well as they have.\u201d \u201cSometimes people just feel as if we want to try something and see if we can shake things up,\u201d Obama said. And he said that in times of stress, people are going to be looking for something. \u201cThey might \u00a0not know what they\u2019re looking for,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cand they may opt for change, even if they\u2019re not entirely confident what that change will bring.\u201d The president seemed skeptical that \u201cthe new prescriptions being offered\u201d would satisfy the frustrations and anger evident in both votes. And he played a bit of defense, saying that his agenda over past eight years had dealt with those issues head on and \u201cthe country\u2019s indisputably better off.\u201d The president earlier opened his Greek visit by offering reassuring words in Greece about the U.S. commitment to NATO even as he prepares to hand off to a Donald Trump administration, saying Democratic and Republican administrations alike recognize the importance of the alliance to the trans-Atlantic relationship. Mr. Obama told Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos that a strong NATO is of \u201cutmost importance\u201d and would provide \u201csignificant continuity even as we see a transition in government in the United States.\u201d Pavlopoulos, for his part, thanked President Obama for U.S. support of the Greek people in a time of social and economic crisis, and said he was confident that Trump \u201cwill continue on the same path.\u201d Trump\u2019s election has generated significant unease in Europe because of his tough talk during the campaign suggesting the U.S. might pull out of the NATO alliance if other countries don\u2019t pay more. Mr. Obama\u2019s reassurances reflect an attempt to ease the deep concerns about Trump and the future of America\u2019s treaty alliances. Yet they may be greeted with skepticism: For months throughout the campaign, President Obama repeatedly assured world leaders in public and private that Trump would not be elected, only to see him emerge victorious from last week\u2019s election. The president also met Tuesday with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, and offered a welcome message of support for the Greeks as they struggle with both economic woes and a huge influx of refugees. The presidetnpledged to keep pressing his view that \u201causterity alone cannot deliver prosperity and that it is going to be important both with respect to debt relief and other accommodative strategies to help the Greek people in this period of adjustment.\u201d Mr. Obama is making the first visit to Greece by a sitting U.S. president since Bill Clinton in 1999. Security was tight, with major roads shut down along President Obama\u2019s motorcade route and a ban on public gatherings and demonstrations in swaths of central Athens and a southern suburb near a seaside luxury hotel where he was staying. Boats were also banned from sailing near the coastline at the hotel\u2019s location. More than 5,000 police were deployed in the capital\u2019s streets for the two-day visit. Left-wing and anarchist groups have planned protest demonstrations for Tuesday afternoon, while an armed anarchist group has called for \u201cattacks and clashes\u201d to disrupt Mr. Obama\u2019s visit. Clinton\u2019s visit, which came during the height of U.S. intervention in the wars ensuing from the breakup of Yugoslavia, was marked with extensive violent demonstrations. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama is scheduled to tour the Acropolis and give a major speech about democracy and globalization before flying on to Berlin. From Germany, he will travel to Peru for an Asian economic summit before returning to Washington on Saturday. President Obama said he was looking forward to visiting the Acropolis because \u201cif you come to Greece you\u2019ve got to do a little bit of sightseeing.\u201d Greece\u2019s government has hailed the president\u2019s visit as being of \u201chuge importance\u201d for both Greece and Europe. The country\u2019s left-led coalition government has been struggling to pull Greece out of six years of a vicious financial crisis that has devastated its economy and left more than a quarter of the workforce unemployed. Despite the U.S. election, the government has pinned its hopes on the U.S. president to help persuade some of the country\u2019s more reluctant international creditors, such as Germany, to grant it significant debt relief. Without a cut in its debt, Athens says, it cannot hope to recover economically - an argument also supported by the International Monetary Fund. Greece has been relying on emergency loans from three consecutive multi-billion euro bailouts from other European Union countries using the euro currency, and the IMF, since 2010. While the United States has not been involved in Greece\u2019s bailout, Athens has long seen it as an ally that could apply pressure on creditors. The U.S. has praised Greek efforts to overhaul its economy but has repeatedly stressed the country must continue with painful reforms. The country\u2019s bailout funds are disbursed following reviews by international debt inspectors of mandated reforms. The government will also be looking for recognition of the country\u2019s role in Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, which saw hundreds of thousands of refugees pass through Greece from Turkey on their way to the more prosperous countries of the European north, and for U.S. pressure on the rest of Europe to help shoulder the burden.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump declared during his presidential campaign that he would pursue an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy approach in the White House, but the reality is that few of the problems he\u2019ll inherit lend themselves to simple solutions. The terror threat is among them -- over the course of a single day last week, there were attacks in Ankara, Berlin and Zurich, with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claiming responsibility for the truck rampage in Germany.  Mr. Trump has already waded into foreign policy debates during his transition and while he has hinted at his foreign policy approach for certain regions, experts say he hasn\u2019t shown a clear-cut strategy for others. Here are some of the top foreign policy challenges he\u2019ll face next year: Mr. Trump will enter the White House next month nearly six years after the Syrian civil war erupted and while he has criticized the Obama administration\u2019s somewhat hands-off posture there, one expert says it will likely be adopted by the new administration.  \u201cI think that the risk aversion on militarizing the U.S. role on Syria that the Obama administration displayed will continue under the Trump administration,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, vice president for new initiatives at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who has helped advise Democratic and Republican secretaries of state on Middle East policy. \u201cI suspect, based on everything he said on \u2018America First,\u2019 he\u2019s going to be very reluctant to get involved in the weeds in reconstructing Syria.\u201d In November, Mr. Trump indicated that he would likely cut off U.S. support for moderate Syrian rebel groups once he takes office and focus instead on targeting ISIS. He\u2019ll also have to decide what posture to adopt toward President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime and Russia, which has helped fight opposition forces, and he\u2019ll have to decide how to deal with Raqqa once it\u2019s liberated from ISIS control. Syria\u2019s humanitarian crisis is part of the conundrum. More than 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and more than 6 million are internally displaced by violence, the United Nations says, and thousands of civilians have been evacuated from Aleppo in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump said his administration is going to help build \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria.  Despite the announcement, he made clear on the campaign trail that his administration would block people from entering the U.S. from places with a history of terror ties. He has also blasted the Obama administration for admitting more than 10,000 Syrian refugees into the U.S. over the last year. The president-elect will have to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose relations with the West have deteriorated since his government\u2019s illegal seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its support of armed separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Mr. Trump has signaled he\u2019d like to follow through on his promise to improve relations with Russia by nominating ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has close ties with Russia, as his secretary of state.  He also recently called the the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia tried to help his candidacy \u201cridiculous.\u201d While he\u2019s demonstrating he wants to achieve a better relationship with Russia, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Defense Secretary nominee Gen. James Mattis (ret.), as well as congressional mainstream Republicans could mitigate any action taken in that direction. \u201cI worry, if he goes with his instincts. I will be more comfortable if he heeds the advice that he\u2019s likely to get from the vice president-elect and the secretary of defense and maybe the secretary of state,\u201d said Steven Pifer, senior fellow the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center on the United States and Europe. Mr. Trump and his advisers, however, have raised the possibility of removing sanctions the U.S. has imposed on Russia for two years, and he\u2019ll have to decide whether to renew them in March.  \u201cIf President Trump comes in and lifts the American sanctions that are on Russia, my guess is it\u2019s going to be very hard for [German] Chancellor [Angela] Merkel and others in the European Union to hold the line in Europe,\u201d Pifer said. \u201cThe West would have given up a huge piece of leverage it has over Russia to try to persuade Russia to try to change its policy toward eastern Ukraine in particular, but also toward Crimea.\u201d The Trump administration also might not see eye-to-eye with Russia on issues like undoing the Iranian nuclear deal, as Mr. Trump has proposed. Russia helped negotiate the agreement and wouldn\u2019t be likely to support pulling out.  Mr. Trump will face a number of challenges with China: friction over trade and economic issues, the cybersecurity threat, its militarization of the South China sea, its pressure on Taiwan and its unwillingness to put pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.  He raised eyebrows when he took a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan after the election and he later said that the U.S. is not bound by the One-China policy -- a diplomatic understanding that has defined the relationship between Washington and Beijing for more than 40 years. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we have to be bound by a One-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI mean, look, we\u2019re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation, with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don\u2019t tax them, with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn\u2019t be doing, and frankly with not helping us at all with North Korea.\u201d The president-elect has also vowed he\u2019d declare China a currency manipulator as soon as he takes office, a promise that is on his campaign website. Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, said the Trump team doesn\u2019t seem to have a full strategy yet on China.  \u201cIt looks to me like Trump is trying to keep China off balance, to try and signal that he\u2019s not necessarily going to conduct business as usual in the same way that it has been conducted over the last eight years under Obama and that he thinks it can appears that he can gain some leverage by signaling a willingness to confront China,\u201d she said.  For the last several months, North Korea has been firing off multiple ballistic missiles and analysts believe that President Obama warned Mr. Trump about the serious threat posed by North Korea during their private 90-minute meeting at the White House following the election.  Glaser said the president-elect, however, seems to lack a plan on North Korea since it\u2019s \u201cnot an issue that Trump knows a lot about.\u201d The concern for the U.S., she said, is that the North Koreans could pose an existential threat to the homeland if they can make a nuclear warhead that can potentially reach U.S. territory.  \u201cDo we have a strategy that focuses on defense? Do we take a much more aggressive posture against North Korea?\u201d Glaser wondered about Trump\u2019s plan. \u201cSome people are raising the possibility of a preemptive strike on a missile, if it\u2019s on a launchpad, because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s atop that missile, whether it\u2019s a satellite or a nuclear warhead. There may be some discussions about whether we really need to try to cut off trade and harm North Korea\u2019s economy, go beyond sanctions that are really focused on depriving North Korea of weapons of mass destruction.\u201d Mr. Trump faces an evolving Europe whose postwar framework could be threatened by Russia and a wave of far-right leaders. This comes as the United Kingdom deals with the process of withdrawing from the European Union after the Brexit vote this year.  \u201cEuropeans will be looking for American leadership and engagement,\u201d said James Cunningham, a former U.S. ambassador who has worked for NATO and the U.S. embassy in Rome. The president-elect\u2019s approach toward Europe, Pifer added, will be shaped by his approach toward Russia. Mr. Trump will have to decide, for example, whether NATO should beef up its presence in the Baltic states and Poland to defend them against Russia. But if Trump shifts current U.S. policy on Russia to improve relations, it could create rifts within the European Union, which Pifer predicts would create problems.  \u201cI\u2019m worried. I can see an outcome that if he listens to the Republican mainstream foreign policy, you\u2019ll see some changes but it won\u2019t be dramatic,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the things he suggested on the campaign trail -- reluctance to criticize Putin, the constant theme that we can have a better relationship with Russia --  I worry that we could be making a fairly major departure that in the end would end up endangering American interests.\u201d The president-elect has said he wants to help broker an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal and potentially make his son-in-law Jared Kushner the negotiator, but experts say the prospects of an agreement are slim to none.  \u201cIt has nothing to do with who the mediator is,\u201d said the Wilson Center\u2019s Miller, \u201cand has a lot to do with the simple reality that Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas are simply not prepared to take the kinds of decisions on the six core issues that drive the conflict -- borders, security, refugees, Jerusalem, recognition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, end of claims in conflict. Neither side is prepared to take the kind of decisions that would allow a mediator to get close.\u201d  What could permanently undermine the peace process, Miller said, is a transfer by the Trump administration of the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

            "article_content": "DALLAS -- The exclusive Dallas boys\u2019 prep school that Richard B. Spencer attended is denouncing the activities and ideas of its white nationalist alumnus.  St. Mark\u2019s School of Texas headmaster David Dini issued the statement of criticism after a Nov. 19 rally in Washington where Spencer, a member of St. Marks Class of 1997, shouted \u201cHail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\u201d as supporters raised their arms in Nazi salutes.  Without referring to Spencer by name, Dini said his activities have \u201cbeen deeply troubling and terribly upsetting to our whole school community. We reject racism and bigotry in all its forms and expressions.\u201d In his statement, posted on the school\u2019s Facebook page, Dini hailed other St. Mark\u2019s alumni for \u201cexpressing their outrage and disgust\u201d toward the National Policy Institute, which Spencer heads, and the ideas that group promotes.  Spencer\u2019s classmates have raised about $40,000 so far in a fundraising campaign to settle refugees in Dallas. One of them is Ben Kusin, former \u201cShark Tank\u201d contestant and chief executive of deodorizing wipes company.  \u201cThis issue hits deep -- not just for me but for everyone,\u201d he told WFAA-TV of Dallas-Fort Worth, adding about the rally, \u201cWhen you see something like this, you have to say something.\u201d\u00a0 The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate group watchdog, describes Spencer as \u201cone of the country\u2019s most successful young white nationalist leaders -- a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old.\u201d  \u201cHe wants to expel all these non-white Europeans from this country,\u201d Kusin said. \u201cOur countermeasure was supporting refugees coming into this country.\u201d\u00a0 Spencer spoke with CBS News\u2019 Jericka Duncan last week about how Donald Trump\u2019s election was giving the alt-right a big boost. \u201cThe word racist doesn\u2019t have any meaning anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically calling me a mean old guy.\u201d\u00a0 Does he discriminate against people because of the color of their skin? Duncan asked him.\u00a0 \u201cEveryone is discriminating in all sorts of things in terms of life,\u201d he said. \u201cI discriminate all the time \u2013 discriminating is living.\u201d\u00a0 An email message to Spencer from The Associated Press drew no response Sunday.  Other school alumni include folklorist/musicologist Alan Lomax, rock stars Steve Miller and Boz Scaggs, actors Tommy Lee Jones and Luke and Owen Wilson, and investigative journalist Kurt Eichenwald.",

            "article_content": "LEESBURG, V.A. -- A hoarse Donald Trump took the stage after midnight -- almost three hours late -- at a fairground here in Leesburg, Virginia. It was his fifth event Sunday.  Thousands of supporters packed the barn and it didn\u2019t seem like anyone was frustrated by Trump\u2019s tardiness, or as he called it, \u201ca midnight special.\u201d  It was the busiest day in Trump\u2019s quixotic year and a half run for the presidency, two days before Election Day. Trump started his run on June 16, 2015. \u201cFamous day, right?\u201d Trump said at his first rally of the day in Sioux City, Iowa.  The stops Trump made; Sioux City, Iowa, an airport hangar in Minneapolis, Minnesota, an amphitheater in suburban Detroit, another airport hangar outside Pittsburgh, and the barn in Northern Virginia, indicated a candidate desperately trying to cobble together a narrow path to 270 electoral votes, as early voting shows other paths out of reach.  \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing,\u201d Trump said in Minneapolis. \u201cIf I don\u2019t win Minnesota, I\u2019m gonna look real bad to those pundits that I do not respect very much.\u201d  The last time Minnesota\u2019s electoral votes went to a Republican presidential candidate was Richard Nixon in 1972. Recent polling shows Hillary Clinton with a comfortable lead in the state. However,\u00a0 Trump needs an upset from a traditionally Democratic states to have any hope of winning the White House -- especially as early voting in battleground states such as Nevada show a significant increase in Hispanic turnout, a demographic which has long viewed Trump unfavorably. Trump is the underdog in most of the other states he campaigned in on Sunday. Polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia have also given Clinton a comfortable lead, although Democrats have shown enough concern that Trump is closing the gap to send a bevy of surrogates there, including sending the former Secretary of State herself to speak in Detroit on Friday.  The Republican nominee\u2019s messaging was knocked off kilter on Sunday when news of FBI director James Comey\u2019s letter to Congress broke, stating that new emails discovered on disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop, related to Clinton\u2019s private email server from her time as Secretary of State, did not contain anything that would change the FBI\u2019s conclusion from the summer -- that this did not rise to the level of criminal prosecution.  After days of praising Comey and the FBI for re-opening the investigation into Clinton, Trump tweaked his message to subtly criticize Comey, saying, \u201cThe investigations into her crimes will go on for a long, long time.\u00a0 The rank and file special agents at the FBI won\u2019t let her get away with her terrible crimes.\u201d  \u201cYou can\u2019t review 650,000 new emails in eight days,\u201d He continued.\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t do it, folks.\u201d  Trump\u2019s ability to stay on message was sorely tested, as he frequently deviated off his prepared remarks, extending his speeches and dragging his schedule later and later into in the night. In particular, Trump seemed fixated on Beyonce and Jay-Z, who recently performed on behalf of Clinton at a campaign event in Cleveland, Ohio.  \u201cJay-Z and Beyonce used the most filthy language you\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Trump said in Minneapolis, referring to their performances on behalf of Clinton. \u201cMany of the audience left during the audience because it was disgusting, the words, right? They left.\u201d  Ironically, Trump\u2019s warm up at his next event in the Detroit suburb of Sterling Heights was musician Ted Nugent,\u00a0 who has long faced criticism for racist and anti-Semitic comments.  Nugent, whose hits include \u201cCat Scratch Fever,\u201d lived up to his raunchy reputation on Sunday. During his remarks, Nugent grabbed his private parts and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got your blue state right here, baby!\u201d  Trump came on stage after and said, \u201cBy the way, my language is much, much cleaner as you know than Jay-Z and Beyonce, boy.\u201d  Trump circled back again to discussing his ambitions to engage in a fist fight with Vice President Joe Biden, a subject he has kept circling back to for weeks.  \u201cBiden, who said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019d like to take him behind the gym.\u2019 Me. I dream about that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd everybody said, \u2018Oh, wasn\u2019t that nice? Oh, did you see what he said? Wasn\u2019t that cute? Oh, it was so wonderful what Joe said. What Joe said. Wasn\u2019t that cute?\u2019 Now, if I ever said that I wanna take him behind the gym and you know what. They\u2019d say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a bully. He\u2019s a terrible person.\u2019\u201d  His darkest rhetoric of the whirlwind day was aimed at the large Somali community in Minnesota, numbering in the tens of thousands.  \u201cHow stupid are they to allow this to happen?\u201d Trump said. \u201dHere in Minnesota, you\u2019ve seen first-hand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without\u00a0 your support or approval, and with some of them then joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world.\u201d  Trump continued.  \u201cA Trump Administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where they are being placed.\u201d  The crowd at the airport hangar in Minneapolis erupted in cheers.  \u201cIt\u2019s the least they can do for you. You\u2019ve suffered enough in Minnesota.\u201d  Trump\u2019s last day of campaigning before Election Day is equally as hectic, with stops in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan on the schedule. Confidence in his ability \u201cto win,\u201d of course, has never been lacking in the businessman.  \u201cWe have the biggest crowds and it\u2019s the greatest movement ever in the history of our country, Trump said in Michigan. \u201cWe now have to go out and we have to vote.\u201d  In Virginia, he added , \u201dThis is going to be Brexit times fifty. This is going to be.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Obama on Thursday warned Donald Trump that he should be willing to stand up to Russia as president, and he talked about his expectations for the president-elect\u2019s actions concerning key U.S. policies and international commitments.  Speaking from Berlin at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during his final trip abroad as president, Mr. Obama said that while he doesn\u2019t expect Trump to follow his administration\u2019s blueprint, he expects him to act in U.S. interests.  \u201cMy hope is that the president-elect, coming in, takes a similarly constructive approach -- finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia, where our values and interests align -- but that the president-elect is also willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms,\u201d Mr. Obama said.  The president suggested it would be harmful if Trump takes a \u201crealpolitik approach\u201d where the U.S. cuts deals with Russia \u201ceven if it hurts people, or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves countries vulnerable.\u201d  Mr. Obama reiterated that he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by Trump\u2019s \u201cinsistence\u201d he won\u2019t change the U.S. commitment to NATO, which the president said Trump made clear to him during a 90-minute meeting at the White House last week.  \u201cHis full commitment to NATO as the foundation for our international security is, I think, very important,\u201d Mr. Obama said.  Mr. Obama is on his last foreign trip, which also includes stops in Greece and Peru. While both leaders met privately, Mr. Obama said they discussed efforts to keep the U.S. and Germany economically competitive, negotiations resulting from Brexit -- the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, the threat of climate change and implementing the Paris agreement, ensuring Iran continues to abide by its nuclear deal, countering cyber threats and the importance of maintaining sanctions against Russia.  Responding to Trump\u2019s previous remarks about stopping the flow of Syrian refugees to the U.S., Mr. Obama said that the global refugee problem is not an issue any one country should bear, and said he hopes robust support for an international response \u201ccontinues beyond my administration.\u201d  The president warned that \u201cpolitics everywhere\u201d will now experience a \u201cbumpy phase.\u201d \u201cAs long as we stay true to our democratic principles, as long as elections have integrity, as along as we respect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, as long as there are checks and balances in our governments so that the people have the ability to not just make judgments about how well the government is serving them, but changing government if the government is not serving them well, then I have confidence that over the long-term, progress will continue,\u201d the president said during his sixth visit to Germany.  In what appeared to be a reflection of Democrats\u2019 failure to connect with every demographic in the presidential election, Mr. Obama said, \u201cIt\u2019s important that we reach out to everybody in our countries -- those who feel disaffected, those who feel left behind by globalization and address their concerns in constructive ways, as opposed to more destructive ways.\u201d  He talked about the danger of presenting stories that aren\u2019t true in the age of social media, as well as the problemsof using social networks in politics.  \u201cIt\u2019s easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communications complex policies,\u201d he said.  In the end, he said he\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about his successor.  \u201cThere something about the solemn responsibilities of that office, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the U.S., not just by its own people, but by people around the world that forces you to focus, that demands seriousness,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf you\u2019re not serious about the job, then you probably won\u2019t be there very long because it will expose problems even when you\u2019re doing a good job.\u201d Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "SAN DIEGO -- Army Capt. Matthew Ball relied heavily on his Afghan interpreter during a yearlong mission in one of Afghanistan\u2019s most dangerous areas, entrusting him daily with his life.  The interpreter received death threats from the Taliban for helping American troops, and has now been in hiding for nearly four years. He ventures out only in the cloak of darkness.  \u201cI\u2019m living my days in hell. Even if someone is not really looking at me, I feel so paranoid, like this guy is going to kill me,\u201d Qismat Amin said in an interview with The Associated Press via an internet call.  Amin is one of more than 13,000 Afghans and their immediate family members waiting to get a special immigrant visa for aiding the U.S. mission, according to the U.S. State Department. A defense bill approved by Congress and sent to President Barack Obama calls for an additional 1,500 visas and extends the program until the end of 2020.  Scores of veterans like Ball, who have been trying to get their translators out of the country, say the number is woefully inadequate and that the United States will be abandoning thousands who helped American troops.  \u201cWe leave and they\u2019re still there and they get hunted, basically, for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Ball, 30, a former Army ranger who now serves in the Reserves. \u201cBeing an interpreter makes you a target. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t live up to our promises on the back end.\u201d\u00a0 America\u2019s longest war, which began in response to 9/11, grinds on in its 16th year. Afghan soldiers and police have been suffering heavy casualties in their battle against a resilient Taliban insurgency, while U.S. forces continue to hunt down al Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants there.  The special visa program started in 2009 to help Afghan translators, cultural advisers and others who have worked for U.S. military or government personnel.  Ball\u2019s interpreter applied more than three years ago for a visa. Among Amin\u2019s letters of recommendation was one from retired Army Gen. John Campbell, the former commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.  ISIS fighters have demanded Amin return to his village, and they took his family\u2019s land last year. But Amin knows he will be killed if he goes back so he has moved to a nearby city.  A bomb blew up outside a police headquarters near where he lives now. A man living nearby was shot by unidentified assailants. Neighbors said he was targeted after working for Americans.  Amin has been unable to work and has spent most of the earnings from working for the U.S. military, which paid him about $650 a month.  Ball has tried to find out why Amin\u2019s visa is in limbo. Now a Stanford University law student, Ball organized a letter drive that led to a dozen congressional inquiries into Amin\u2019s case, to no avail.  Amin this month was told to come in for a medical appointment at the U.S. embassy in Kabul, another step forward in the process. But he still has no word on whether he\u2019ll get a visa.  Amin\u2019s long wait is not unique.  Sher Mohammad Haidari, 26, submitted more than three dozen written recommendations from colonels, generals and other U.S. military officers who commended him for his bravery. In one incident, Haidari heard the Taliban speak in code about firing on two dozen soldiers and translated it to the troops. They took cover, and a three-hour firefight ensued. He was wounded.  In 2011, Haidari completed a three-hour interview for his visa. Then everything stalled. He regularly received death threats until his visa finally was approved this year. Haidari moved to California with his wife and baby son in September.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other interpreters who were shot, hurt, are crazy disabled, and all of them are stuck in Afghanistan,\u201d Haidari said.  David Sossaman, 57, a security specialist, lobbied for Haidari and three other interpreters who worked for him.  \u201cI can\u2019t figure out why there is even a cap at all,\u201d said Sossaman, who lives in Ramona, east of San Diego. \u201cIf somebody assisted us in the war over there and saved American lives by running convoys so our troops could be doing their jobs, or whatever, and they now have gotten active threats by known Taliban, why even limit it?\u201d  Congress has added 7,000 visas to the program over the past two years to meet the demand, and the process has sped up. So far in fiscal year 2016, a total of 4,283 visas have been issued to Afghans who helped the U.S. mission. That compares to 2,636 for 2015, the state department said in an October report.  But thousands are still waiting amid the worsening security situation.  Betsy Fisher, policy director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, wanted Congress to approve an additional 4,000 visas so the process could be expedited for applicants living in danger.  New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, agreed, saying: \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of life and death as Afghans who served the U.S. mission continue to be systematically hunted down by the Taliban.\u201d  The program has enjoyed bipartisan support. But veterans, like Ball, worry about its future under President-elect Donald Trump, whose national security campaign proposals included a temporary ban on Muslims, the religion of many of the Afghans who helped the U.S. mission. Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, has objected to increasing the visas. He raised concerns about its costs tied to federal benefits like Medicaid and food stamps that are available to Afghans who resettle in the U.S. and become lawful permanent residents.  After Trump\u2019s election, Ball received a message from Amin, who said he was growing increasingly fearful for his life.  \u201cHe told me, \u2018If I stay too long, I might not make it,\u2019 which totally breaks my heart,\u201d Ball said.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Kristen Bell has lent her voice to more than just \u201cFrozen\u201d character Anna; the actress is also known for speaking out about issues that include parenting and equal pay for women. Now, the actress is also bringing her wit and humor to commercials for Enterprise. She talked to CBS News about why her daughters don\u2019t watch \u201cFrozen,\u201d her holiday plans and how she feels about the president-elect.  Tell me what was fun about making these commercials for Enterprise.  It was very collaborative. They were interested in how I interpreted the script. I got to add my own dialogue -- goofy things I would actually say or would find myself doing should I have the ability to run around like a child at any of the Enterprise locations and play with the vehicles.  Do you like driving?  I do. My husband actually races professionally often so it\u2019s his turf but yes, I do.  What are your holiday plans?  We are staying home. We did a fair amount of traveling this year and we\u2019re just hunkering down, watching Christmas movies and celebrating Christmas here with our family at our house in L.A.  Is \u201cFrozen\u201d a staple in your house?  No. They don\u2019t actually watch \u201cFrozen,\u201d believe it or not! I put it on for them and it was a little too scary. They like the characters but they don\u2019t really watch the movie. We do a lot of PBS Kids. Their attention span is not two hours as of yet, so we do the 11-minute TV show programs when they watch TV.  Do they understand that that\u2019s you as Anna, though?  They do because we talk about it with them -- what we do for a living -- and they know there\u2019s a real person behind the voices of the cartoons they watch and my daughter was watching a cartoon and said, \u201cThey\u2019re not real, but there is a person behind them doing a voice.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYeah, oh my gosh, you get this.\u201d She sounds really smart.  She knows Idina is Elsa. She knows Josh is Olaf. She\u2019s able to associate humans with characters, which I think is rare for a three-year-old.  What can you tell us about \u201cFrozen 2\u201d? I wish I knew. We haven\u2019t seen anything yet. I thought we\u2019d be recording by now but they\u2019re still working on the script. But we did an Olaf special that comes out next Christmas and the music has been written for it.  There\u2019s been a lot of talk about how \u201cFrozen\u201d really diverges from traditional princess stories and embraces strong women. How does it feel to be part of a project like that?  I feel proud. I don\u2019t love stories that have just a bad guy and you never explore what made them bad or sad and \u201cFrozen\u201d did a great job with that. We talk with the kids about why the bad guy is sad and what made him sad and grumpy. I was really proud \u201cFrozen\u201d didn\u2019t really have a villain, or at least not in Elsa. She was a very complex, misunderstood character. I was really proud of representing that story.  You represent lots of viewpoints on social media or in your art. You\u2019ve talked about mental health, the Syrian refugee crisis, equal pay -- what\u2019s been the best part of having the platform you have?  Just knowing I can be a voice for people who feel voiceless. There are important issues that many of us don\u2019t see on a day-to-day basis in the comfort of our lives and I am definitely included in that. I don\u2019t run into refugees here in L.A. but I stay abreast of what\u2019s happening because people are important to me.  You were pretty vocal against Donald Trump during election season. Now that he\u2019s our president-elect, how do you feel about moving forward?  I think it\u2019s important to unify our country again. I think the most important thing is to listen, to hear other people and hear where they\u2019re coming from. I think understanding people is the only thing that works.  Speaking of equal pay, was there a time in your career when you felt particularly discriminated against for being a woman?  In \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall,\u201dJason Segel was the only one nude in the movie. I thought it was about time someone turned the tables and we had a little male nudity to balance all the female nudity in Hollywood. I thought that was an inspired choice.

This summer, the social media giant reached 500 million users \u2013 a \u201cthrill\u201d because it\u2019s a feat not a lot of apps have actually reached, said Charles Porch, the company\u2019s head of global creative programs.\u00a0 \u201cI think what\u2019s happened on Instagram is that we\u2019ve really become this community that\u2019s organizing around shared interests and shared passions,\u201d Porch told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d Thursday. \u201cPeople are really forming these really strong ties and it keeps propelling the community forward, and it\u2019s really helping the growth on the platform.\u201d  Instagram has also became a major platform for sharing news, from the tragic shooting at an Orlando nightclub to the historic presidential election.  For example, Instagram account \u201ctheworldwidetribe\u201d puts a face to the refugee crisis. Jaz O\u2019Hara, a British fashion student, started the account by capturing life inside a refugee camp in France. Now with over 20,000 followers, O\u2019Hara has documented the needs of refugees all over the Middle East and Europe.  UPDATE from @kelsas in Turkey: We have now delivered 425 more blankets to people living in the rural areas outside Izmir. This brings the total number of blankets delivered to 2,000! At just under \u00a35 each (they are huge and thick..this little babe can't even pick one up haha), we've spent the whole fundraiser pot... but there are new families arriving from Syria every day. Mattresses to sleep on are still needed and these cost \u00a35 each too. We need at least another 1,000. Instead of a pressie, consider buying someone a mattress or blanket for Christmas this year. It will only cost you \u00a35 and it might just allow one of these Syrian cuties and their parents the good night's sleep they so desperately deserve \u263a\ufe0f the link is in my bio \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\u2764\ufe0f A photo posted by Jaz O'Hara | Worldwide Tribe (@theworldwidetribe) on Nov 28, 2016 at 11:47pm PST  Part 2/3 \"The smugglers squeezed me into the back of a truck with 40 others and we crossed the Sahara desert to the Libyan coast.  We had no food and no water. I didn\u2019t eat for 12 days but I didn\u2019t feel hungry, just desperately thirsty. The smugglers made all of us share one bottle of water a day. They put petrol in it so you could only drink a little bit at a time, to stop us from gulping it down in desperate thirst. I thought I was going to die in that truck but I made it to the sea, 8 months pregnant.  Here, on the Libyan coast, I slept on the floor on a huge warehouse with many many other people. I had not seen a doctor for my entire pregnancy. The only water we had was very dirty. I didn\u2019t know what would be better, to drink it and help my desperate thirst, or not to drink it because it was so unclean. Finally we were given some food here, pasta. We all ate from one plate. We were so hungry we burnt our hands on the food, within seconds it was gone.  One morning it was finally my turn and I was packed onto oldest, scariest looking boat I have ever seen. I can\u2019t swim. We got on with no food and no water, and any belongings we had left were thrown overboard to make more space for other passengers.  It was too full for me to sit down. My body was heavy and tired, everything hurt. Many people were crying but I just felt numb, I had to keep moving forward. It had to get better than this. It couldn\u2019t get worse. But then it did. We had been out at sea for two days when the contractions started. At first I tried to hold it in, but before long I could not help but scream in pain. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I tried to stop them coming, but I had to push. I was so so scared. Some of the women on the boat held my hand and stroked my hair. They helped me give birth to my boys. The men didn\u2019t know where to look! The boys were so tiny. I had no towel, nothing to wrap them in, nothing at all. We continued to float aimlessly in the sea as I held my new babies in my arms, totally helpless, praying for a miracle, praying to be saved.\" A photo posted by Jaz O'Hara | Worldwide Tribe (@theworldwidetribe) on Sep 6, 2016 at 1:08pm PDT Of its 500 million active users, over 80 percent are from outside the U.S. That includes perhaps one of the most famous global celebrities: Pope Francis.

            "article_content": "BERLIN -- President Obama is stressing a message of solidarity and trans-Atlantic cooperation on his final visit Thursday to Germany -- a top trade partner, key NATO ally and home to thousands of American troops, as well as a nation critical to solving Europe\u2019s migrant crisis and debt woes. CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan reports that two other names were looming large over President Obama\u2019s meetings in Berlin; Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 President-elect Trump\u2019s rhetoric and friendly outreach to Russia has German Chancellor Angela Merkel and many others in her country -- and across Europe -- concerned. Her foreign minister went so far as to call Mr. Trump a \u201cpreacher of hate.\u201d Mr. Obama arrived Wednesday night in Berlin from Greece, making his sixth and final visit as president to Germany, where he has been popular since even before he was elected. His eight years in office have helped erase much of the anti-American sentiment that had grown during the administration of George W. Bush over the Iraq war and other policies. Merkel, who worked well with Bush before Mr. Obama\u2019s election, dined with the president Wednesday night at his hotel and was to hold talks with him Thursday afternoon. The downtown area around the Chancellery and hotel where Mr. Obama was staying was locked down tightly, with some 2,400 police officers on hand manning road blocks and checkpoints. In a joint opinion piece published Thursday in Germany\u2019s weekly business magazine Wirtschaftwoche, which seemed directed as much at the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. as European nations, the two leaders stressed that the \u201cunderlying bedrock of our shared values is strong\u201d even if the pursuit of common goals is sometimes gone about differently. Mr. Obama and Merkel noted that European Union-U.S. trade was the largest between any two partners worldwide, and emphasized that the trans-Atlantic friendship has helped forge a climate accord, provide help for refugees worldwide, form a collective defense under NATO, and strengthen the global fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). \u201cThat friendship is based on our shared commitment to personal freedom and dignity, which only a vibrant democracy under the rule of law can guarantee,\u201d the leaders wrote. Merkel and Mr. Obama have enjoyed a close relationship over the years, and Mr. Obama seems to be counting on the German leader\u2019s strength to help counter the isolationist tone voiced by president-elect Donald Trump during the election campaign. Although the relationship hit a bump in 2013 when it was revealed the U.S. National Security Agency had been monitoring the chancellor\u2019s cell phone, tensions were smoothed over after President Obama acknowledged Germany\u2019s anger and promised new guidelines for monitoring. When Mr. Obama first visited the German capital in 2008, some 200,000 exuberant fans packed the road between the landmark Brandenburg Gate and Victory Column to hear the then-candidate, in a speech that solidified his place on the world stage. In a city where President John F. Kennedy in 1963 pledged steadfast American support for Germany against the Soviet bloc with his iconic \u201cIch bin ein Berliner\u201d speech and President Ronald Reagan in 1987 challenged then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to \u201ctear down this wall,\u201d Mr. Obama told Berliners that true progress requires sacrifice and shared burdens among allies. \u201cThat is why America cannot turn inward,\u201d he told the cheering crowd. \u201cThat is why Europe cannot turn inward.\u201d Eight years later, his words seem to have foreshadowed the nationalist, isolationist forces gaining traction in some parts of Europe and punctuated by Trump\u2019s victory in the U.S. election. In Germany, officials have been outspokenly hopeful that the change in presidents will not signal a significant shift in relations between the two nations or the NATO alliance. \u201cThe Americans are among ...\u00a0 our most important partners and we want to continue this partnership economically, politically and through shared values,\u201d Peter Tauber, the general secretary of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Party, told reporters in Berlin, ahead of Mr. Obama\u2019s visit. \u201cI think one will see that Mr. Trump will have his own political suggestions, but that the USA won\u2019t be a different country tomorrow.\u201d White House aides had hoped Mr. Obama might be able to return to the Brandenburg Gate, where he spoke in 2013, for a symbolic visit on his last trip to Germany, but the visit didn\u2019t materialize. Overall, the celebratory nature of the U.S. president\u2019s final world tour has been significantly tamped down in light of the U.S. election results. In Berlin, Mr. Obama will also meet Friday with the leaders of France, Italy, Spain and Britain. He\u2019s expected to address Mr. Trump\u2019s election and the direction the U.S. might take in the next four years. Merkel already talked with Mr. Trump by phone after his election, offering him Germany\u2019s \u201cclose cooperation,\u201d but emphasized it would be on the basis of what she said were shared values of \u201cdemocracy, freedom, respect for the law and for the dignity of human beings, independently of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views.\u201d In addition to the U.S. election, Mr. Obama and Merkel are expected to discuss a wide range of issues behind closed doors, including joint efforts to resolve the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, the fight against ISIS and trans-Atlantic trade. Mr. Obama traveled to Berlin from Greece, which has been at the center of Europe\u2019s debt crisis, and the president was also expected to encourage some sort of debt forgiveness for the country -- something the International Monetary Fund has lobbied for but Germany and several other nations oppose. The refugee issue is also at the top of the agenda on Mr. Obama\u2019s trip. Greece was the entry point to Europe for hundreds of thousands of migrants last year. Germany has taken in the vast majority with some 1.1 million arrivals since the start of 2015.",

            "article_content": "VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis warned against what he called a \u201cvirus of polarization\u201d and hostility in the world targeting people of different nationalities, races or beliefs, as he led a ceremony Saturday giving the Roman Catholic Church 17 new cardinals from six continents. The consistory ceremony in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica formally inducted the churchmen into the cardinals\u2019 ranks. Francis used his homily to also caution the new \u201cprinces of the church,\u201d as cardinals are sometimes called, to guard against animosity creeping into the church as well, saying \u201cwe are not immune from this.\u201d The pope spoke of \u201cour pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose and condemn\u201d and cautioned somberly against those who \u201craise walls, build barriers and label people.\u201d Earlier this year, when asked about the plan by Donald Trump, then a Republican U.S. presidential candidate and now president-elect, to build a wall to keep Mexicans and others from illegally entering the U.S., the pope replied that anyone advocating building walls isn\u2019t a Christian. Francis, in a message a few days earlier to U.S. bishops, had urged them to help heal a society facing growing polarization. On Saturday, after receiving his red hat, Mexican Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes, archbishop of Tlalnepantla, expressed concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s plans, including deporting large numbers of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, soon after assuming the presidency. \u201cYou can\u2019t divide a family. You can\u2019t divide a community. You can\u2019t divide the world,\u201d the prelate said in reply to a question by The Associated Press about Trump. The Mexican churchman added: \u201cOne thing is the election campaign. Another thing is reality.\u201d In Saturday\u2019s homily, Francis commented on how \u201cwe see, for example, how quickly those among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee, become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come from a distant country, or have different customs. An enemy because of the color of their skin, their language, or social class.\u201d He added: \u201cThe virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking, feeling and acting.\u201d Francis also lamented the tendency to \u201cdemonize\u201d one\u2019s opponents, \u201cso as to have a \u2018sacred\u2019 justification for dismissing them.\u201d Cardinals serve as papal advisers and someday elect popes\u2019 successors. Popes look to cardinals who share their approach to the church\u2019s mission in the world. Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin is among the newly made cardinals. Tobin defied the governor of the U.S. state of Indiana, Mike Pence, by welcoming Syrian refugees. Tobin in January will become archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, while Pence will be installed as U.S. vice president. CBS News correspondent Seth Doane asked Tobin if the pope\u2019s message was a political statement aimed at America. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if it had anything to do with the U.S. election because I think you can see similar movements in many parts of the world,\u201d Tobin told Doane. Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich, after being made a cardinal at Saturday\u2019s ceremony, said the church has a special role in trying to bring people together across the political spectrum. He noted that on Sunday, Masses are celebrated in 26 languages in his diocese. \u201cPeople feel disenfranchised\u201d from sharing in the common good, the cardinal said in an interview with The Associated Press. Another American in the latest crop of cardinals is Irish-born Archbishop Kevin Farrell, who led the Dallas diocese before Francis appointed him to head the Vatican office dealing with family issues. At a post-ceremony reception, Farrell acknowledged that polarization is felt within the church, too. \u201cWe\u2019ve become gods on both sides - gods on the left, and gods on the right, and neither one of these are correct,\u201d Farrell told an AP reporter. The clash of mentalities between the conservative camps and the so-called progressives chosen by Francis has played out publicly in recent days. Four prominent, disgruntled cardinals, including a U.S. prelate, Raymond Burke, who is one of Francis\u2019 most vocal critics, in a letter to the pope aired their doubts about his more compassionate approach to the contentious issue involving divorced Catholics. They fear his approach could sow confusion among the faithful. Church teaching forbids divorce, and says Catholics who remarry without annulments of their earlier marriage are essentially adulterers who can\u2019t receive communion. In a document earlier this year, Francis suggested that clerics could decide case-by-case if these Catholics could receive Communion. Farrell, asked about the tensions over the divorce issue, appeared to be open toward the pope\u2019s prescription for more compassion. \u201cThere is no situation in life that\u2019s black and white. Anybody that\u2019s lived in this world will have encountered those situations in their personal lives,\u201d Farrell said. The new cardinals, who pledged loyalty to the pope, come from Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North and South America. One of them, an 88-year-old Albanian priest, Ernest Simoni, spent 18 years in prison because of his faith during the communist regime in his homeland. Since cardinals are usually bishops already, Francis bestowed a rare honor in giving that rank to Simoni, a simple priest. When Francis visited Albania in 2014, he was brought to tears when Simoni told him how he was persecuted. The pope\u2019s envoy to Syria is now Cardinal Mario Zenari. The Italian archbishop remarked how the bright crimson hue of the cardinals\u2019 cassocks and of the square, peaked headgear evokes the color of the blood spilled by innocent children killed in the five-year-old civil war there. Also among the new cardinals is Archbishop Dieudonne Nzapalainga, of Bangui, Central African Republic. Last year, Francis visited Nzapalainga\u2019s country, bloodied by sectarian violence between Christian and Muslim militants. Thirteen of the 17 new cardinals are under 80 years old and thus eligible to vote in a secret conclave for the next pope. Francis has now appointed 44 of the 120 cardinals young enough to elect his successor. The others were named by the previous two pontiffs, John Paul II, whom Francis made a saint, and Benedict XVI, who retired in 2013, and generally reflect a more conservative leaning on church issues. After the ceremony, the new cardinals and Francis took minibuses to the monastery on Vatican grounds where Benedict lives so they could greet him. One of the cardinals, an 87-year-old bishop from Lesotho, Africa, was too frail to come to Rome for the ceremony.",

            "article_content": "\u00a0ATHENS, Greece Pushing back against the forces of isolationism, President Obama stood at the birthplace of democracy on Wednesday and declared it\u2019s time for a \u201ccourse correction\u201d to ensure that the benefits of technology and globalization are more broadly shared. Reducing inequality, he said, creates societies where people are \u201cless likely to turn on each other, less likely to appeal to some of the darker forces\u201d that tear people apart. With the U.S. presidential election of Republican Donald Trump laying bare frustrations and dissatisfaction in America, Mr. Obama acknowledged the forces that would try to turn the clock back. \u201c[T]here are at times movements from both the left and the right to put a stop to integration, and to push back against technology, and to try to bring back jobs and industries that have been disappearing for decades,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a speech to the Greek people at the end of the first leg of his farewell foreign tour as president. \u201cSo this impulse to pull back from a globalized world is understandable.\u00a0 If people feel that they\u2019re losing control of their future, they will push back.\u201d But he had this message to leaders and people around the globe: \u201cWe can\u2019t look backward for answers, we have to look forward.\u201d\u00a0 The president said the path to more inclusive economies is known, but \u201cwe too often don\u2019t have the political will or desire to get it done.\u201d Workers, he said, must have \u201cmore leverage and better wages,\u201d and he added that we have to invest more in our young people, encourage entrepreneurship and modernize our infrastructure.\u00a0 \u201cWe cannot sever the connections that have enabled so much progress,\u201d Obama said. Obama cited both last week\u2019s election of Trump and the June vote by Britain to leave the European Union as evidence of the inclination to pull back. \u201cThe current path of globalization demands a course correction,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the years and decades ahead, our countries have to make sure that the benefits of an integrated global economy are more broadly shared by more people and that the negative impacts are squarely addressed.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how democracies can deliver the prosperity and hope that our people need,\u201d Obama said. Before Trump\u2019s victory, Obama\u2019s speech to the Greeks had been envisioned to be a capstone moment for his presidency, harking back to the origins of democracy as he expected to hand off to fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton. Instead, Obama\u2019s legacy is in doubt as Trump prepares to take power and promises to undo much of the president\u2019s agenda. Obama spoke out in defense of his agenda: the Iran-nuclear deal, a global climate change pact, establishing relations with Cuba and more. \u201cThe next American president and I could not be more different,\u201d Obama said. But, he said, \u201cdemocracy is bigger than any one person.\u201d He renewed his pledge to ensure a peaceful transition despite his differences with Trump. Obama\u2019s words are being watched closely by world leaders. They see parallels between Trump\u2019s ascension and the rise of far-right and populist movements in their own countries amid continued economic anxiety. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras won elections last year on what critics say was a populist platform, though one on the left of the political spectrum. He pushed his formerly small radical left party onto the forefront by telling Greeks weary from six years of financial crisis and falling living standards that he would reject austerity measures imposed in return for the country\u2019s bailouts. But after the near collapse of negotiations with Greece\u2019s creditors - other European countries using the euro currency, and the International Monetary Fund - Tsipras performed a political about-face: He signed up to a new bailout and more austerity to prevent his country being forced out of the euro. Before Obama\u2019s speech, he toured Greece\u2019s most famous ancient monument, the Acropolis citadel. Obama passed through the Propylaea, the monumental gateway that serves as an entrance to the site, and walked along the Parthenon temple, which is dedicated to the goddess Athena, considered the patron of Athens. The U.S. president lingered at the base of the Parthenon, gazing at the columns and glancing around at the panoramic view of Athens as he chatted with his guide, Eleni Banou of the Culture Ministry\u2019s antiquities division. The 5th century B.C. temple is surrounded these days by scaffolding as part of a maintenance project. The entire site was closed to the public for the day for Obama\u2019s visit, which has taken place amid stringent security measures. Demonstrations were banned in parts of Athens, and road and subway stations were shut down for the first official visit of a sitting U.S. president since Bill Clinton came in 1999. Greece\u2019s government hoped Obama would help persuade some of Greece\u2019s more reluctant international creditors to grant debt relief, and pressure other European countries to share more of the burden of the continent\u2019s refugee crisis. Obama was receptive to Greece\u2019s woes and repeated his belief that debt relief is necessary. He said Greece must continue putting in place painful reforms it signed up to in return for successive international bailouts. It is questionable how much of this stance will also be adopted by Trump. Greece is struggling to deal with hundreds of thousands of refugees who have crossed Greece\u2019s borders on their way to more prosperous European countries. A reluctance by many other EU countries to host refugees has left more than 60,000 people stranded in Greece. Many are living in poor conditions in massively overcrowded camps. Obama said the Greeks cannot be expected to bear the bulk of the burden on their own. It demands \u201ca truly collective response by Europe and the world,\u201d he said. Obama\u2019s next stop on his final foreign tour is Germany, followed by Peru.",

            "article_content": "BERLIN -- President Barack Obama used a meeting with key European leaders Friday to urge them to work with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump and to discuss steps necessary to resolve the conflicts in Syria and eastern Ukraine, the White House said. Obama\u2019s meeting with the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Spain was likely his last in such a setting before he leaves office. The session expands on lengthy talks he held the day before with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Obama didn\u2019t speak with reporters before departing for Peru on Air Force One. The White House said Obama thanked his counterparts for their cooperation during his two terms in office. He urged them to work on common challenges with a Trump administration on the \u201cbasis of the core values that define the United States and Europe as open democracies.\u201d Since Obama\u2019s arrival on Wednesday on his sixth and last trip to Germany as president, he and Merkel have focused several meetings on issues of globalization and trans-Atlantic cooperation. The talks come largely in the context of what the election of Trump will mean to efforts to seek peace in Ukraine and Syria, the strength of the NATO alliance, trade agreements, efforts to fight climate change, and other pressing matters. The White House said in a summary of the meeting that the leaders expressed grave concern about the humanitarian situation in Aleppo. They agreed that increased attacks by the Syrian regime and its supporters, including Russia and Iran, should be immediately halted. They also are calling for humanitarian access to the city to be restored. On Ukraine, the White House said the leaders agreed that sanctions against Russia must remain in place until it meets its commitments to resolving the conflict. Obama also briefed his counterparts on the progress made in Iraq in liberating Mosul from Islamic State militants. The White House said the leaders agreed on the need for stability after the city is liberated. Obama also encouraged leaders to continue efforts to expand information sharing throughout the European Union to help disrupt terror attacks. At a news conference with Obama on Thursday, Merkel diplomatically said she was approaching the incoming Trump administration \u201cwith an open mind.\u201d Around the world, many are looking to Merkel - one of the longest serving leaders of a major world power, leader of Europe\u2019s largest economy and one of the biggest U.S. trade partners with the U.S. - for leadership as Obama leaves office. Obama seemed to underscore that reality as he effusively thanked Merkel for her \u201cdeep friendship.\u201d He said he couldn\u2019t \u201cask for a steadier or more reliable partner on the world stage,\u201d while adding that if she chooses to run again for a fourth term next year, he\u2019d vote for her - if he could. Joining the two leaders Friday were the heads of countries at the center of many of the European Union\u2019s coming challenges. British Prime Minister Theresa May is preparing her country for negotiations to leave the trade bloc. Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy faces economic woes in his country that have contributed to financial instability in the EU. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s already shaky economy has been rocked by tens of thousands of refugees. And French President Francois Hollande\u2019s socialist government faces a major challenge from the far-right in elections next year. Trump has applauded the British decision to exit the EU, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d and has had meetings with Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party and a key player in the British decision to leave. For his part, Obama said Thursday his hope was that the Brexit negotiations be \u201cconducted in a smooth and orderly and transparent fashion and preserve as closely as possible the economic and political and security relationships between the UK and EU.\u201d Still, Obama noted that he considered the EU \u201cone of the world\u2019s great political and economic achievements.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Vice President-elect Mike Pence has a long history as an anti-abortion crusader. As Indiana governor, he signed one of the most restrictive abortion bills in the country. So why is\u00a0Planned Parenthood suddenly being flooded with donations in his name? Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky (PPINK) said Tuesday that in the week since Election Day, the organization has received a whopping 1,400 donations \u2014 a total of $25,000 \u2014 \u201cfrom\u201d Vice President-elect Pence. The donations have actually been made by abortion-rights supporters in a collective effort to make a statement by deluging Pence\u2019s office with thank you notes. Unlike President-elect Donald Trump, whose stances on abortion and women\u2019s health have wavered over the years, Pence\u2019s position has long been clear.\u00a0 When he served in Congress, Pence was known for single-mindedly tackling social issues like abortion. In 2011, he\u00a0spearheaded the effort to defund Planned Parenthood. In March, Pence, as governor,\u00a0signed a bill preventing women from obtaining an abortion because of a fetus\u2019 genetic abnormalities. A federal judge\u00a0blocked the Indiana law in June, saying that the state does not have the authority to limit a woman\u2019s reasons for deciding to end a pregnancy. Now people who disagree with Pence\u2019s views are taking action by writing checks. The surge of generous donations comes after social media users and celebrities, including \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d host John Oliver and comedian Amy Schumer, encouraged people to make donations to charitable organizations that oppose the Trump agenda. \u201cWe\u2019re going to actively stand up for one another,\u201d Oliver said during his post-election show. \u201cI\u2019m talking about actual sacrifice to support people who are now under threat.\u201d Oliver then suggested people donate to organizations like Planned Parenthood, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the International Refugee Assistance Project, and the Center for Reproductive Rights in the names of their pro-Trump relatives. WARNING: This video contains profanity. Schumer took a snarkier approach, sharing a post with her 5.3 million Instagram followers suggesting that people actually make the donations in Pence\u2019s name. \u201cYou can make a donation to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence\u2019s name and he\u2019ll receive the certificate of the donation,\u201d the post said.  Done and done @ppact A photo posted by @amyschumer on Nov 12, 2016 at 11:39am PST \u201cDone and done,\u201d Schumer wrote. From there, the movement started taking off, and PPINK couldn\u2019t be happier. \u201cWe are pleased that this outpouring of support recognizes the good work PPINK does and we welcome the financial support to continue to serve our patients who need us the most,\u201d Betty Cockrum, President and CEO of PPINK, said in a statement provided to CBS News. \u201cHoosiers have recognized how bad Pence is for women for a really long time and now the nation is joining us in the fight against him.\u201d\u00a0 PPINK confirmed that Pence will receive notifications of the donations made in his honor at his office in the Indiana Statehouse. The office of Indiana Governor Mike Pence told CBS News they have no comment.",

An unidentified individual yelled \u201cgun\u201d while Trump was speaking, the Secret Service said in a statement. Secret Service agents and Reno police detained the man and after a thorough search, did not find a gun, the statement said.\u00a0 That was very chaotic. Trump was just rushed off stage by Secret Service. Fights started breaking out in the crowd. Not sure why. CBS News producer Arden Farhi said it all happened very quickly, but it appeared their was a commotion near the podium.\u00a0 Trump returned to the stage shortly afterward, and said \u201cnobody said it was going to be easy for us. But we will never be stopped. Never, ever be stopped.\u201d He thanked the Secret Service and then returned to his speech.\u00a0 The Reno rally was a last-minute trip to the swing state. It was his third rally on Saturday in the last, long weekend before Election Day.\u00a0 Trump began speaking just before 5:30 p.m., according to CBS affiliate KTVN. Looking specifically at Reno, Trump said that \u201cReno and northern Nevada can carry this thing.\u201d He continued to say in regards to Tuesday\u2019s vote, \u201cIt\u2019s up to the great people of Washoe County to get this done.\u201d Then he spoke against the man who he called \u201cCrazy Harry\u201d, Senator Harry Reid. However he did not endorse any candidate to take his place.\u00a0 Other talking points included the \u201crigged system\u201d and the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.

Switching to international policy, he said he would \u201csuspend the Syrian refugee problem\u201d and keep \u201cradical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.\u201d Then began speaking about building the wall, the \u201cgreat wall\u201d at Mexico\u2019s border, emphasizing that he would let people in legally.

            "article_content": "MAIDUGURI, Nigeria -- Nigerian troops rescued one of the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram extremists more than two years ago in a pre-dawn raid Saturday on a forest hideout. She had a 10-month-old baby boy born to a Boko Haram fighter, said a statement from army spokesman Col. Sani Kukasheka Usman. It was the first army rescue of a Chibok girl. Last month, Nigeria\u2019s government secured the freedom of 21 of the Chibok schoolgirls in the first such release negotiated with Boko Haram. Another girl escaped in May on her own. Thousands of other Boko Haram captives have been freed this year as the military has forced the extremists out of towns and villages in northeastern Nigeria, where they had declared an Islamic caliphate. But until Saturday, none proved to be among the 276 schoolgirls seized from northeastern Chibok town in April 2014. Dozens of them escaped within hours. President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to secure the release of the nearly 200 schoolgirls who remain captive. The failures of successive governments and security forces to free the girls brought international condemnation and the creation of a movement called Bring Back Our Girls. U.S. first lady Michelle Obama posted a picture of herself under that hashtag and vowed her husband would do everything in his power to help bring the girls home. Former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s initial refusal even to admit the girls had been taken hostage, losing precious days after their capture, contributed to his loss in the 2015 elections. Meanwhile, activists and relatives have objected to the government\u2019s prolonged holding of Amina Ali Nkeki, the girl who escaped in May. She says she wants to be reunited with her mother and the father of her child, a detained Boko Haram extremist whom she says also was a victim of kidnapping and helped her escape. The government says she is receiving trauma counseling and other care at a military hospital in Abuja, where she has been joined by the girls released last month. Human rights activists have protested against the prolonged military screening of escapees from Boko Haram that has kept thousands held in detention, where Amnesty International has reported babies are among those dying from inhumane conditions. Some 20,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram\u2019s seven-year Islamic uprising that has spread across borders and forced 2.6 million refugees from their homes.",

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon, the chief strategist and right-hand man to President-elect Donald Trump, denied in an interview that he was an advocate of white nationalism -- and gave hints instead about how his brand of \u201ceconomic\u201d nationalism will shake up Washington.  In The Hollywood Reporter, Bannon, the controversial former head of Breitbart News who went on to chair Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, discussed why he believed his candidate won the election.  \u201cI\u2019m not a white nationalist, I\u2019m a nationalist. I\u2019m an economic nationalist,\u201d Bannon told the news outlet earlier this week. \u201cThe globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f\u2014ed over.\u201d Bannon\u2019s appointment to the White House has drawn criticism from Democrats and several civil liberties groups, in part because of his (and Breitbart\u2019s) strong association with the alt-right, a political movement with strains of white supremacy. In the past, the former Breitbart CEO has admitted the alt-right\u2019s connections to racist and anti-Semitic agendas. \u201cLook, are there some people that are white nationalists that are attracted to some of the philosophies of the alt-right? Maybe,\u201d Bannon told Mother Jones in August. \u201cAre there some people that are anti-Semitic that are attracted? Maybe. Right? Maybe some people are attracted to the alt-right that are homophobes, right? But that\u2019s just like, there are certain elements of the progressive left and the hard left that attract certain elements.\u201d In the Reporter interview, Bannon challenged the notion that racialized overtones dominated the Trump campaign on the trail. He predicted that if the administration delivered on its election promises, \u201cwe\u2019ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we\u2019ll govern for 50 years.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s everything related to jobs,\u201d Bannon said and seemingly bragged about how he was going to drive conservatives \u201ccrazy\u201d with his \u201ctrillion-dollar infrastructure plan.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWith negative interest rates throughout the world, it\u2019s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up,\u201d he proposed. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution \u2014 conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.\u201d Bannon, in the Reporter interview, also gave some insight into how he viewed his political foes (presumably, liberals and the media) -- and the \u201cdarkness\u201d he touts in fighting against them. \u201cDarkness is good,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cDick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That\u2019s power. It only helps us when they...get it wrong. When they\u2019re blind to who we are and what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",

            "article_content": "PELHAM, N.C. - In today\u2019s racially charged environment, there\u2019s a label that even the KKK disavows: white supremacy. Standing on a muddy dirt road in the dead of night near the North Carolina-Virginia border, masked Ku Klux Klan members claimed Donald Trump\u2019s election as president proves whites are taking back America from blacks, immigrants, Jews and other groups they describe as criminals and freeloaders. America was founded by and for whites, they say, and only whites can run a peaceful, productive society. But still, the KKK members insisted in an interview with The Associated Press, they\u2019re not white supremacists, a label that is gaining traction in the country since Mr. Trump won with the public backing of the Klan, neo-Nazis and other white racists. \u201cWe\u2019re not white supremacists. We believe in our race,\u201d said a man with a Midwestern accent and glasses just hours before a pro-Trump Klan parade in a nearby town. He, like three Klan compatriots, wore a robe and pointed hood and wouldn\u2019t give his full name, in accordance with Klan rules. Claiming the Klan isn\u2019t white supremacist flies in the face of its very nature. The Klan\u2019s official rulebook, the Kloran - published in 1915 and still followed by many groups - says the organization \u201cshall ever be true in the faithful maintenance of White Supremacy,\u201d even capitalizing the term for emphasis. Watchdog groups also consider the Klan a white supremacist organization, and experts say the groups\u2019 denials are probably linked to efforts to make their racism more palatable. Still, KKK groups today typically renounce the term. The same goes for extremists including members of the self-proclaimed \u201calt-right,\u201d an extreme branch of conservatism mixing racism, white nationalism and populism. \u201cWe are white separatists, just as Yahweh in the Bible told us to be. Separate yourself from other nations. Do not intermix and mongrelize your seed,\u201d said one of the Klansmen who spoke along the muddy lane. The Associated Press interviewed the men, who claimed membership in the Loyal White Knights of the KKK, in a nighttime session set up with help of Chris Barker, a KKK leader who confirmed details of the group\u2019s \u201cTrump victory celebration\u201d in advance of the event. As many as 30 cars paraded through the town of Roxboro, North Carolina, some bearing Confederate and KKK flags. Barker didn\u2019t participate, though: He and a Klan leader from California were arrested hours earlier on charges linked to the stabbing of a third KKK member during a fight, sheriff\u2019s officials said. Both men were jailed; the injured man was recovering. Like the KKK members, Don Black said he doesn\u2019t care to be called a white supremacist, either. Black - who operates stormfront.org, a white extremist favorite website, from his Florida home - he prefers \u201cwhite nationalist.\u201d \u201cWhite supremacy is a legitimate term, though not usually applicable as used by the media. I think it\u2019s popular as a term of derision because of the implied unfairness, and, like \u2018racism,\u2019 it\u2019s got that \u2018hiss\u2019 (and, like \u2018hate\u2019 and \u2018racism,\u2019 frequently \u2018spewed\u2019 in headlines),\u201d Black said in an email interview. The Klan formed 150 years ago, just months after the end of the Civil War, and quickly began terrorizing freed blacks. Hundreds of people were assaulted or killed as whites tried to regain control of the defeated Confederacy. During the civil rights movement, Klan members were convicted of using murder as a weapon against equality. Leaders from several different Klan groups have told AP they have rules against violence aside from self-defense, and opponents agree the KKK has toned itself down after a string of members went to prison years after the fact for deadly arson attacks, beatings, bombings and shootings. The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, which monitor white extremist organizations and are tracking an increase in reports of racist incidents since the election, often use the \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d label when describing groups like the Klan; white nationalism and white separatism are parts of the ideology. But what exactly is involved? The ADL issued a report last year describing white supremacists as \u201cideologically motivated by a series of racist beliefs, including the notion that whites should be dominant over people of other backgrounds, that whites should live by themselves in a whites-only society, and that white people have their own culture and are genetically superior to other cultures.\u201d That sounds a lot like some of the ideas espoused by today\u2019s white radicals, yet they reject the label. That\u2019s likely because they learned the lessons of one-time Klan leader David Duke, who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana this year, said Penn State University associate professor Josh Inwood. \u201c(There was) this peddling of kinder, softer white supremacy. He tried to pioneer a more respectable vision of the Klan,\u201d Inwood said. Extremist expert Sophie Bjork-James, a scholar at Vanderbilt University, prefers the term \u201cracist right\u201d to describe today\u2019s white supremacists. \u201cThey are not simply conservative or alt-right, but actually espousing racist ideas and racist goals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey won\u2019t agree with this label, but I think it is important to be clear about what they represent and what their goals are.\u201d Whatever you call them, the muddy-road Klansmen said their beliefs have gained a foothold. The popularity of Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall on the Mexican border - an idea long espoused by the Klan - is part of the proof, they said. \u201cWhite Americans are finally, most of them, opening their eyes and coming around and seeing what is happening,\u201d said a man in a satiny green Klan robe.",

            "article_content": "Let the transition begin: Donald Trump comes to the White House this morning to meet the man he\u2019s replacing, President Obama, at Mr. Obama\u2019s invitation. The two exchanged bitterly harsh words about each other on the campaign trail, but the current oval office occupant has pledged to make the transition to the Trump administration a smooth one. During the campaign, Trump vowed to swiftly repeal Obamacare if elected. He will be getting that chance, potentially dealing a massive blow to participants in the federal health care program and to President Obama\u2019s legacy.\u00a0Is the Affordable Care Act living on borrowed time? Everyone knows about Trump\u2019s planned crackdown on illegal immigrants and criticism of global trade. But the president-elect\u2019s views on everyday pocketbook issues, such as taxes and interest rates, are less well-known. We fill in some of the blanks in four areas crucial to people\u2019s financial health. Donald Trump\u2019s brand of right-wing populism and economic nationalism is at work in more places than just the U.S. -- and parties espousing similar views could win elections in a handful of European countries in coming months. Hillary Clinton\u2019s emotional concession speech was praised as \u201cclassy\u201d and \u201cpoignant.\u201d She joins a select group of politicians who came up short in their quest for the White House. The losses can haunt them for months or even years. Take a look at how previous candidates have coped with stinging losses. Donald Trump will soon become familiar with some new real estate. The president-elect will move into the White House with his wife, Melania, and 10-year-old son, Barron. His adult children are expected to be frequent guests. See what we can expect from this unique first family. Commentary: To get a better idea about what\u2019s going on in America, the Washington press corps is going to have to embrace humility. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone that, with a few exceptions, its members were all tacitly or explicitly #WithHer (Hillary Clinton), which has led to a certain anguish in the face of Trump\u2019s victory. Imagine an online shopping day that was more than four times the size of Cyber Monday in 2015. A day when $20 billion worth of items are forecast to be sold this year.

            "article_content": "South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott praised President-Elect Donald Trump\u2019s decision to nominate Dr. Ben Carson to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), suggesting in an interview this week that the \u201cbrilliant\u201d neurosurgeon could bring a \u201cfresh perspective\u201d to the department. \u201cYou bring a guy who we all know is brilliant into a space without any set of preconceived ideas\u2026Someone who\u2019s done very well in life who actually lived in poverty and now is going to help other who live in the same place he lived in get better,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThat\u2019s good news for those folks living there.\u201d Carson, a former Republican presidential candidate, grew up poor in Detroit before going on to become one of the most prominent neurosurgeons in the country. Scott suggested that background may be helpful to Carson as he embarks on his new job.  \u201cAs a person born in Detroit, who has seen the revitalization happen in Detroit, I think he will take with a new lens the approach that is consistent with how do you rebuild some of the areas of our country that have to be rebuilt for our country the American family to prosper together? I think he will take a very conscientious approach,\u201d Scott predicted. The South Carolina Republican, who\u2019s currently the only black Republican in the Senate, mentioned one specific shortcoming at HUD that Carson may be able to address. \u201cSo many folks who are poor and looking for ways to improve their plight live in housing that has not been inspected for years. And yet there sits in an account millions of dollars waiting to be used for inspections,\u201d Scott explained. \u201cThe current administration has not done that. I think bringing in a fresh pair of eyes of someone who is going to be meticulous about the details is going to be very helpful. I think we\u2019ll see millions of dollars that have been sitting there used for inspections to improve the quality of life, to improve the quality of the living space of the folks that are living in HUD houses.\u201d Asked what he\u2019ll listen for during Carson\u2019s confirmation hearing, Scott replied, \u201cI want to know his vision for improving the use of the resources given to HUD, number one. Number two, how do you create a path that transitions people out of government subsidized housing into the free market?\u201d Scott also suggested that Trump\u2019s decision to tap Carson for the post signals that HUD will be a priority for his administration. \u201cOne of his closest allies in the last several months of the campaign was Ben Carson and to put one of your closest allies into such a strategic position I think sends an important signal that he is serious about improving the quality of life in the urban areas,\u201d the senator explained. In contrast to his effusive praise of Carson, Scott became notably more circumspect when he was asked about another of Mr. Trump\u2019s recent staffing picks \u2013 the selection of former Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon as his chief strategist.  Critics have accused Bannon of stoking white nationalism, racism, and anti-semitism during his tenure at Breitbart, a right-wing news website. Scott, for his part, said he\u2019s never met Bannon, and he suggested he\u2019s reluctant to judge someone he doesn\u2019t know. \u201cI don\u2019t know Mr. Bannon at all. Never met him. Never been to the Breibart site,\u201d Scott said. \u201cSo it\u2019s hard for me to comment on anything other than what I\u2019ve seen in the press. What I think we will have to do is judge the Trump administration by what comes out of the Trump administration and not the collective pieces.\u201d \u201cRight, but if Ben Carson sends a signal, surely then Bannon does as well,\u201d Face the Nation moderator John Dickerson said. \u201cWhat kind of a signal do you think that is?\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t tell you, to be honest with you,\u201d Scott replied. \u201cWhat I know about Ben Carson is through personal interaction, watching him on the campaign trail\u2026I\u2019m very cautious to have a conversation about someone [with] whom I have not had a conversation at all.\u201d For more of Dickerson\u2019s interview with Sen.

            "article_content": "Breitbart News, an ultraconservative website that has served as a platform for the white nationalist \u201calt-right\u201d movement, is touting its growing readership and \u201cmain street American values\u201d as a reason advertisers should stick with it.\u00a0 Some marketers, however, are heading for the exits, directing their advertising dollars away from Breitbart amid the publication\u2019s call for a boycott against Kellogg\u2019s (K), which has pulled its ads from the site. That prompted Breitbart to declare \u201cwar\u201d on Kellogg\u2019s: Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow said on the site that \u201cto blacklist Breitbart News in order to placate left-wing totalitarians is a disgraceful act of cowardice.\u201d Breitbart\u2019s campaign against Kellogg\u2019s is unusual on a number of fronts, not in the least because news organizations traditionally maintain a separation between their business operations and their editors and reporters so that journalists can operate independently from business interests.\u00a0 And whether the boycott will help Breitbart financially appears questionable, given that attacking a major advertiser isn\u2019t likely to make the site more appealing to other brands.\u00a0 \u201cReporters don\u2019t behave that way in the U.S., nor should they,\u201d said Lee Wilkins, professor and chair of the department of communications at Wayne State University, who\u2019s an expert in media ethics. \u201cMost journalistic organizations have checks between the people who pay for your news work and the news work itself, so that you are as a journalist protected from those influences.\u201d She said she views Breitbart as a blog rather than a journalistic organization. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t a journalism organization, then those safeguards are never in place.\u201d \u00a0 Other companies saying this week that they\u2019ll pull their ads from Breitbart include Vanguard, 3M (MMM) and AARP, among others. Kellogg\u2019s said it decided to remove its advertising because Breitbart didn\u2019t align with its values. It said the decision has \u201cnothing to do with politics.\u201d Stephen Bannon, Breitbart\u2019s former chairman, served on President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and is now set to become one of the incoming president\u2019s top advisers in the White House. Vanguard said it removed its ads as soon as it became aware that they were running on Breitbart. \u201cAs a policy, Vanguard does not advertise on any overtly political websites, including the site in question,\u201d a spokeswoman wrote in an email. She said the ads appeared as part of a \u201cremarketing\u201d program, which are ads that appear to clients and investors when they visit third-party websites because of their browsing history.\u00a0 \u201cOur remarketing advertisements are limited to pre-approved sites (again, no political sites), however it was brought to our attention last week that this site was inadvertently included,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Breitbart\u2019s advertiser showdown comes as the anti-Trump campaign #GrabYourWallet is taking aim at the site, officially adding it to its own boycott list on Thursday. #GrabYourWallet was created before the election by Sue Atencio, a 59-year-old grandmother, and marketing specialist Shannon Coulter, as a way to express concerns about Trump\u2019s boasts of sexual assault. Since his victory, the boycott of stores that sell Trump brands has picked up steam.\u00a0 \u201cBecause of the way digital advertising works, we\u2019re not yet adding companies that advertise on Bretibart to the boycott list,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them time to work with their media buyers and ad networks to ensure their ads no longer appear there.\u201d While Breitbart is billing Kellogg\u2019s decision as \u201cbigoted and anti-American,\u201d it\u2019s a well-established American business practice for corporations to shift their sponsorship to companies they believe will help bolster their brand. In the case of reaching conservative audiences, advertisers that exit Breitbart aren\u2019t necessarily snubbing those consumers because other conservative-leaning outlets, such as Fox News or Glenn Beck\u2019s The Blaze, have an overlap.\u00a0 \u201cThere are a lot of places advertisers can go to reach the same audience, and even maybe a bigger audience,\u201d Wilkins said.\u00a0 Nevertheless, Breitbart has been buidling its readership in the past year. Five Thirty Eight noted that its traffic has increased along with Trump\u2019s political career. While many news sites got a bump in traffic as the campaign heated up, Breitbart\u2019s growth was faster than other sites.\u00a0 Some Breitbart readers are joining the boycott with enthusiasm, tweeting statements such as \u201ccereal shouldn\u2019t be political\u201d with the hashtag #dumpkelloggs. At the same time, their message is generating pushback from internet wags who are creating satirical names under the hashtag #BreitbartCereals, such as \u201cRace Krispies\u201d and \u201cGrope Nut Flakes.\u201d Breitbart is \u201cbehaving stupidly,\u201d Wilkins said of the Kellogg\u2019s boycott. \u201cUnfortunately, we are all allowed to be stupid.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Lt.-Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.) has been offered the position of national security adviser by President-elect Donald Trump, CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett confirmed Thursday. Trump transition to the White House - live blog Flynn, a lifelong Democrat, is a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) -- he was one of the highest-ranking national security officials supporting Trump, whom he also informally advised him on foreign policy during the primary campaign. He is also known to be a proponent of stronger ties with Russia, as well as a critic of President Obama.\u00a0 Trump had at one point reportedly\u00a0considered Flynn for vice president before choosing Mike Pence. The Associated Press first reported that Flynn had been offered the post. U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee, issued a statement saying he is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Flynn\u2019s views on Russia, and questioned Flynn\u2019s \u201cuncritical acceptance\u201d of the Turkish crackdown on dissent. Schiff also criticized Flynn\u2019s \u201cinflammatory remarks\u201d about Muslims.\u00a0 Flynn, who turns 58 in December, built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. He retired in 2014 and has been a fierce critic of President Barack Obama\u2019s White House and Pentagon, taking issue with the administration\u2019s approach to global affairs and fighting ISIS. In February, Flynn had a controversial tweet about Muslims. In the tweet, he said fear of Muslims is rational.\u00a0 Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions... https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU Mr. Trump is a foreign policy novice and his early moves on national security are being closely watched by U.S allies and adversaries alike. He\u2019s said to be considering a range of officials with varying degrees of experience to lead the State Department and Pentagon.\u00a0 The president-elect also held his first face-to-face meeting with a world leader on Thursday, since winning the presidential election, huddling privately with Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe. While Mr. Trump made no comments following the meeting, Abe said the president-elect was \u201ca leader in whom I can have great confidence.\u201d  Mr. Trump also consulted with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and sat down with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a potential contender to lead the State Department.\u00a0 In Washington, Vice President-elect Mike Pence huddled with Republican leaders in Congress. He then met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the newly elected leader of the Senate Democrats, seeking to convey respect as Democrats prepare for Republican rule of both chambers and the White House for the first time in a decade.  \u201cWe look forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward,\u201d Pence said outside Schumer\u2019s Senate office.  In a separate gesture of reconciliation with establishment Republicans, Mr. Trump planned to meet with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who lambasted Mr. Trump as a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d in a stinging speech last March. Trump responded by repeatedly referring to Romney as a \u201closer.\u201d  The two began mending fences after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory when Romney called with congratulations. They are to meet this weekend, a transition official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss Mr. Trump\u2019s schedule publicly. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said they were still \u201cworking on\u201d the meeting.  Mr. Trump\u2019s actions Thursday aimed to show leaders both in the U.S. and overseas that he could soften his rhetoric, offer pragmatism in the White House and reaffirm longstanding American alliances. Since his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton last week, Mr. Trump has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and nearly three dozen other world leaders by telephone.\u00a0 Ron Dermer, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States, also visited the skyscraper and called Mr. Trump \u201ca true friend of Israel.\u201d He specifically cited as another \u201cfriend\u201d Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, whose selection as a top White House adviser has created a backlash among Democrats. Bannon\u2019s news website has peddled conspiracy theories, white nationalism and anti-Semitism.  \u201cWe look forward to working with the Trump administration, with all the members of the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon, in making the U.S.-Israel alliance stronger than ever,\u201d Dermer said.  Mr. Trump, a reality television star, business mogul and political newcomer, also rolled out new teams that will interact with the State Department, Pentagon, Justice Department and other national security agencies. The move is part of the government transition before Mr. Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration.  Coordination had been on hold until Mr. Trump\u2019s team submitted documents including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest.  White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday, meaning agencies could start providing briefings and written materials to Mr. Trump\u2019s team. Indeed, the departments of State, Defense and Justice say meetings are being set up.\u00a0 Conway said she expected initial announcements of Cabinet choices to come \u201cbefore or right after Thanksgiving,\u201d telling reporters Mr. Trump he was \u201cloving\u201d the transition. \u201cHe\u2019s a transactional guy. He\u2019s somebody who\u2019s used to delivering results and producing.\u201d  One potential Cabinet member, Eva Moskowitz, said had taken herself out of the running to become education secretary. Moskowitz, a Democrat and advocate for charter schools, met with Mr. Trump this week, stoking speculation that she might inject a bit of bipartisanship in the new administration.  Moskowitz, who voted for Clinton, suggested there were \u201cpositive signs\u201d that Mr. Trump might govern differently than he campaigned, but she wrote in a letter to parents that many of her students, who are overwhelmingly black and Latino, would feel that \u201cthey are the target of the hatred that drove Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Police had to get involved Saturday afternoon, after a protest turned violent on Pennsylvania Avenue, CBS affiliate WUSA reports.\u00a0 Approximately 300 protesters were gathered outside of the Reagan building, to voice their concern with the National Policy Institute, a group that has been called Anti-Semitic, racist, and xenophobic. When two people, claiming to be NPI staff, entered the crowd with a camera, they were attacked by some members of the crowd. NPI was in town for an annual convention, which often invites protest. The protest this year was intensified due to the recent election, as many of the signs were anti-Trump as well. \u201cWhite nationalism is ugly,\u201d said Eric Hamlin, who was protesting. \u201cIt\u2019s gross.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a person of Jewish faith,\u201d said another protester, who went by Zay. \u201cI don\u2019t want any Nazis in my city. I don\u2019t want them in my country.\u201d The protest began peaceful, but turned violent when two advocates came out for NPI. Emily Youcis was joined by a photographer, as she tried to ask people in the crowd questions. \u201cDo you hate white people,\u201d she asked one protester. Shortly after the questioning began, a protester spray painted Youcis\u2019 hair. Minutes later, a fight broke out, as protesters appeared to have attacked the photographer. Police had to break the fight up, and the photographer was left with a bloody gash on his forehead. \u201cI think they\u2019re the racists here,\u201d Youcis said shortly after the attack. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been sprayed in the face, I\u2019ve been told to f*** off, they bloodied my cameraman, and stole his phone. They\u2019re the violent people.\u201d At least two protesters were put in handcuffs, although it\u2019s unclear if any arrests were made. Most of the protesters remained peaceful, although vocally against the organization. Many in the crowd began chanting monikers like \u201cNazi scum,\u201d \u201cwhite supremacists,\u201d or \u201cfascists\u201d when the duo tried to speak. After protesting outside of the Reagan building, the group marched to the Trump International Hotel, where it took on a political tone. While the primary target was NPI, there was plenty of anti-Trump chants as well. Pat Loveless, who decades ago lost six fingers in altercations with the KKK, said this fighting takes away from their message. \u201cNobody needs violence,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to solve anything. Because we\u2019re preaching against the same thing we\u2019re marching against.\u201d",

Trump has also vowed to build a giant border wall and make Mexico pay for it. \u201cWe are in the business of eliminating barriers,\u201d said Claudia Ruiz Massieu, Mexico\u2019s foreign minister. \u201cThat\u2019s why we would not consider paying for any wall that puts barriers between our integration and competitiveness,\u201d she said. Massieu said that if the Trump administration pus up a fight, Mexico will respond. \u201cMexico is ready to protect our people, to protect our interests, but we are also ready to work with the next American administration,\u201d she said. Mexican Sen. Armando Rios Piter isn\u2019t taking any chances. He has drafted a law that would stop Mexico from using public funds to pay for a border wall.  He also said Mexico could retaliate by revising security agreements with the U.S. \u201cSharing information, the way our visas are functioning right now, have a lot to do with the decisions that have been taken in terms of protecting the United States, no?\u201d Piter said. When told that sounded like a threat, he replied \u201cNo, the threat is what Trump is doing.\u201d Manuel Bojorquez is a CBS News national correspondent based in Miami.

            "article_content": "The three-state\u00a0recount efforts spearheaded by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein effectively came to an end Monday -- with little to show for it. Stein initially filed for recounts in three states where the final margin for President-elect Donald Trump was narrow: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. She and her campaign will hold a call Tuesday morning to address what\u2019s next. In Wisconsin, officials announced Monday evening that the recount was complete -- and that rather than find additional votes for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton or Stein, the recount actually increased President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s margin there by 131 votes. Mr. Trump won the state by a margin of 22,748 votes, according to the newest totals from the Wisconsin Election Commission. Stein\u2019s campaign paid approximately $3.5 million for the Wisconsin recount. And in Pennsylvania, a federal judge ruled Monday morning against Stein\u2019s request for a review of the voting systems, saying it was possible they had been hacked and compromised. In his decision, federal judge Paul Diamond said Stein\u2019s allegation of possible election tampering \u201cborders on the irrational.\u201d Diamond also cited the delay between Election Day and Stein\u2019s decision to file the lawsuit, and said Stein didn\u2019t have standing to sue on the issue. \u201cGranting her later than last minute request for relief, however, could well ensure that no Pennsylvania vote counts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch a result would be both outrageous and completely unnecessary; as I have found, suspicion of a \u2018hacked\u2019 Pennsylvania election borders on the irrational.\u201d Stein could appeal the decision, but time is short: all states must certify their election results by this Tuesday, so it\u2019s unlikely any new action could be taken before then.  And in Michigan, the third state on Stein\u2019s list, the recount process ended last week after a judge lifted an order forcing the statewide review of ballots. The recount lasted three days, and examined ballots in 20 of the state\u2019s 83 counties. Stein first began raising money for a possible recount in late November, and quickly began bringing in millions of dollars for the effort. According to Stein\u2019s fundraising page, the effort has raised more than $7.3 million. Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "BANJUL, Gambia -- Gambia\u2019s opposition candidate has defeated longtime ruler Yahya Jammeh in the West African country\u2019s presidential vote, an upset victory that could lead to the first transfer of power in more than two decades, the head of the election commission announced Friday. Adama Barrow won 263,515 votes, or 45 percent of the total, while Jammeh finished in second with 36 percent, Alieu Momarr Njai said. A third candidate, Mama Kandeh, received 17 percent, he said. \u201cI hereby declare Adama Barrow duly elected president of the Republic of Gambia for the next five years,\u201d Njai said. He said Jammeh would be calling Barrow \u201cto congratulate him and pray for peace and tranquility.\u201d Jammeh himself had not issued a public statement by early afternoon. \u201cThere will be celebrations, there will be disappointment, but we all know we are all Gambia,\u201d Njai said, calling for peace, tolerance and tranquility to be respected as it was during campaigning. Gambians voted Thursday by placing marbles into drums marked for each candidate. Eight opposition parties united behind Barrow, a former businessman, and the campaign period featured large opposition rallies and unprecedented expressions of frustration with Jammeh\u2019s rule. Nevertheless, Jammeh had projected confidence, saying his victory was all but assured by God and predicting \u201cthe biggest landslide in the history of the country\u201d after he voted on Thursday. \u201cWe are happy to be free,\u201d said Omar Amadou Jallow, an opposition leader for the People\u2019s Progressive Party, which joined the coalition that backed Barrow. \u201cWe are able to free the Gambian people from the clutches of dictatorship, and we are now going to make sure Gambia becomes a bastion of peace and coalition. Our foundation will be based on national reconciliation.\u201d Jammeh came to power in a coup in 1994 and then swept elections in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011 after a 2002 constitutional amendment removed presidential term limits. Critics say those earlier elections were not free and fair. Human rights groups have accused Jammeh of ordering the deaths of countless political opponents as well as targeting journalists and gays and lesbians. All internet and international phone service was cut on election day in a bid by Jammeh to thwart unrest. If Jammeh agrees to step down peacefully, it would demonstrate that even Africa\u2019s most entrenched leaders can be brought down if opposition politicians overcome their divisions and unite, said Jeffrey Smith, a human rights activist and founding director of Vanguard Africa, a U.S.-based group that worked with Gambia\u2019s opposition coalition. \u201cThis is going to have resonance way beyond the tiny borders of Gambia,\u201d Smith said, describing the result as \u201ca momentous occasion for the region writ large.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s nearly impossible to sum up the year 2016 with a single word, phrase, or story. Dominated by political coverage and consumed with tragedy, there\u2019s little doubt that events of this year will go down in history for having a lasting impact on millions of people. Here are 16 stories that unfolded in 2016 which will surely reverberate into 2017 and far beyond.\u00a0 The narrative of the 2016 election seemed to set the tone for the entire year. Donald Trump\u2019s surprising win came at the end of a long, bitter campaign where both sides flung accusations of sexism, racism, lies, cover-ups, illegal activity, and even sexual assault.\u00a0 The country saw for the first time a political candidate who could change the entire conversation with a tap of his thumb and a tweet. And we saw our first female nominee of a major political party, Hillary Clinton. But it was the \u201cOctober surprises\u201d that ultimately came to dominate the story of the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s came in the form of a leaked \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, more than a decade old, in which he described groping women in offensive detail. Clinton\u2019s was a letter from FBI director James Comey to Congress updating the status of an investigation into her email server that didn\u2019t result in charges but never quite disappeared. Both story lines exemplify the dark clouds that hovered over each candidate throughout the race. Now, Americans are buckling up for the political roller-coaster ride that\u2019s likely to last for the next four years. The hacking of the Democratic National Committee before the convention in July was a game-changer that rocked the presidential race. The following email leaks exposed damaging and embarrassing information on the Democrats, creating a major headache for the Clinton campaign.\u00a0 But it increasingly became clear that the larger story was that the hack revealed America\u2019s vulnerabilities to countries like Russia. U.S. intelligence officials said the attack had Russian \u201cfingerprints,\u201d and as the investigation progressed their\u00a0confidence grew that Russia was directly involved with the intent of influencing the election. Most recently, officials said they believe Russian President Vladimir Putin himself ordered the hack. Although Donald Trump disputed Russia\u2019s role, senators from both parties have called for an investigation that will keep making headlines in the new year. The brutal war in Syria is nearing its six-year mark, with no end in sight for the violence that has already killed more than 400,000 people and driven nearly five million from their homes.\u00a0 Several cease-fire deals were made this year, including one agreed to in mid-December just after Syrian government forces claimed the hard-hit city of Aleppo, but in many cases they failed to protect vulnerable civilians. The realities of war were exposed through heartbreaking photos, videos, and even a Twitter account belonging to a 7-year-old girl and her mother. Among the most searing images of the year was one of a 5-year-old boy just after an airstrike, bloodied and ashen-faced with a blank stare in the back of an ambulance. He is just one of many innocent children who have known nothing but war their entire lives. The U.S. election wasn\u2019t the first shocking vote of 2016. In June, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in a move nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201d After months of bitter campaigning, the result sent Britain\u2019s prime minister packing and caused economic panic across the globe. The leaders of the \u201cLeave\u201d movement campaigned on the idea that, among other things, the U.K. could have tighter control of its borders without the E.U., while \u201cRemain\u201d supporters mostly argued that leaving would be an economic disaster\u00a0for Britain. Now the country\u2019s new prime minister plans to move forward with Brexit negotiations, and the official break could happen as early as 2019. Mosquitoes were public enemy number one in many parts of the world this year due to their role in spreading the Zika virus.\u00a0 Brazil was the epicenter of the outbreak, where thousands of babies were born with Zika-related microcephaly, or a small head and under-developed brain. That\u2019s just one terrifying result linked to the virus, and it seemed researchers learned more each day throughout the year. The virus has also been linked to\u00a0miscarriages\u00a0and a neurological condition called\u00a0Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which can cause paralysis. Although the World Health Organization said in November the virus is no longer a \u201cglobal health emergency,\u201d\u00a0Zika continues to spread, with locally transmitted cases reported in Florida and Texas for the first time in recent months. President Obama declared a state of emergency in response to the Flint water disaster on January 16, 2016. That was a little less than two years after the local government switched the city\u2019s water source to the Flint River, causing an unprecedented public health crisis\u00a0which officials were slow to recognize. The resulting corrosion of the water pipes meant the residents of Flint, many of them poor and a majority black, were drinking lead-contaminated water day after day. When Obama approved FEMA aid, at least 100 children had already tested with high lead levels in Flint, and many more cases were feared.\u00a0Lead poisoning can permanently and severely affect mental and physical development, according to the Mayo Clinic, and is especially harmful to children and pregnant women. The year was punctuated by horrific attacks like the January siege by\u00a0al Qaeda-linked militants\u00a0on a popular tourist hotel in Burkina Faso, in West Africa, that left nearly 30 people dead, and a deadly bombing at the Brussels airport in Belgium that killed 32 in March. A terror cell involved in 2015\u2019s Paris attack was found to be behind the Brussels plot.\u00a0 Suicide bombers linked to ISIS targeted the Istanbul airport in a similar attack just three months later, killing more than 40. Then in July, an attacker killed 86 people when he drove a large truck through a crowd celebrating France\u2019s Bastille Day in Nice. And in December, at least 12 died when a hijacked truck slammed into a popular Christmas market in Berlin. The suspect, a migrant believed to have ties to ISIS, fled, sparking a manhunt across Europe. In the midst of pride celebrations across the country, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history targeted the very group that should have been celebrating. A lone gunman entered Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, just after last call on Latin night on June 12, 2016. For several hours, he terrorized club-goers as he gunned down 49 of them while holding off police just outside. The attack left the LGBTQ community feeling raw and unsafe in a space that was meant to be their haven.\u00a0 Americans from all walks of life responded by\u00a0donating blood, offering shelter, and providing comfort and support for those devastated by the massacre. 2016 felt especially cruel as the losses of major cultural icons built up in a steady stream throughout the year \u2014 so many that it would be daunting to list them all here.\u00a0 From musical game-changers like David Bowie and Prince, to beloved actors Alan Rickman and Gene Wilder, to The Greatest,\u00a0Muhammad Ali, America seemed to be in a constant state of mourning over our treasured figures.\u00a0 The deaths of political giants like Supreme Court\u00a0Justice Antonin Scalia and former first lady Nancy Reagan left no facet of American culture untouched by a devastating loss this year. Prince\u2019s death was a high-profile chapter in the opioid addiction epidemic plaguing the U.S. that has dramatically increased in recent years. According to the Department of Health and Human services, 78 people die every day in this country from an opioid-related overdose, whether it be prescription drugs or heroin. Several gut-wrenching videos and photos went viral this year of users near death in public places, sometimes with children involved. In March, President Obama called the crisis is as great a threat as terrorism. Two black men were shot and killed by police in two days in early July, and in both cases video of the incidents went viral, escalating tensions between the black community and law enforcement.\u00a0 Alton Sterling was killed in Baton Rouge after an altercation with officers outside of a liquor store, and the very next day Philando Castile was shot 7 times in his car after a Minnesota officer pulled him over for a busted taillight. His girlfriend, who was in the car along with her 4-year-old daughter, broadcast the aftermath on Facebook Live. The raw, emotional content of her video was widely shared on social media as many people questioned how the shooting could have happened. The officer has since been\u00a0charged with manslaughter.\u00a0 The shootings re-ignited a national\u00a0conversation about race, policing, and how to bridge the deep divide often exposed between the two. Just days after the deaths of Sterling and Castile, a sniper angry over their shootings targeted and shot 12 Dallas police officers who were protecting a peaceful protest. Five officers were killed, and the country struggled with grief over such senseless violence.\u00a0 \u201cWe ask police to do too much and we ask too little of ourselves,\u201d President Obama said at the funeral for the Dallas officers, imploring Americans to come together in unity.\u00a0 But just 10 days later, it happened again: an attacker gunned down three officers in Baton Rouge. In both cases, the gunmen were killed by police and were believed to have acted alone. When convicted rapist\u00a0and ex-Stanford swimmer Brock Turner was sentenced to just six months in jail, the nationwide outcry was loud and clear. But it was his victim\u2019s impassioned letter to the court, published in full online, that opened up the conversation on sexual assault and the nature of consent in America, especially on college campuses. Many pointed to Turner\u2019s light sentencing, and the judge\u2019s reasoning that he did not want jail to have a negative impact on Turner\u2019s future, as a reason why victims often are afraid to come forward. The woman\u2019s letter also called out Turner\u2019s lawyers for citing her drinking as part of their defense. Critics say this kind of narrative suggests victims \u201cask for it\u201d or should be held partly responsible when an assault takes place.\u00a0 Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte found himself in hot water after fibbing about being robbed at gunpoint during the 2016 Rio Games. Turned out, he and some younger teammates had actually just been asked to pay for damage they caused while drunk at a gas station. While some people shrugged them off as \u201cdrunk kids\u201d who \u201cmade a mistake,\u201d others pointed to the larger issue of privilege, saying the 32-year-old Lochte felt it was OK to lie on a national stage. His story infuriated Brazil because the country had already gone to great lengths to prove it was prepared to safely host the Olympics, and the unwelcome distraction wasted time and resources. Lochte ultimately bounced back with a spot on ABC\u2019s \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d Meanwhile, U.S. women\u2019s soccer star Hope Solo had her contract terminated after she said her Swedish opponents played like \u201ccowards\u201d in an Olympic match.\u00a0 It   was the year of the underdog in the baseball and basketball worlds. First, the Cleveland Cavaliers came back from a 3-1 deficit in the NBA finals against the Golden State Warriors to win their city\u2019s first professional sports championship in more than 50 years. Even more unbelievable was who they beat \u2014 the Warriors were being lauded as the best team in history after winning a record 73 games in a single season.\u00a0 Then in November, the Chicago Cubs broke a 108-year curse by winning the World Series against the Cleveland Indians in heart-stopping fashion. Their victory in extra innings in Game 7 kept millions of fans on the edge of their seats.\u00a0 It was the first time the Cubs had even made it to the World Series since 1945. Fake news ran rampant on social media throughout the presidential election, and was sometimes even shared by political candidates. But it wasn\u2019t until after the election that Facebook made the decision to crack down on it.\u00a0 Fake news sites often masquerade as legitimate sources, and they target the ultra-conservative and liberal corners of the internet. People tend to read and share stories that confirm their own biases, but don\u2019t always\u00a0fact-check the information.\u00a0 Such stories have already proven to have dangerous consequences in real life. The outlandish\u00a0\u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory\u00a0spread among users on Reddit and ended with a gunman opening fire in a D.C. pizza restaurant.\u00a0 So it should come as no surprise that Oxford Dictionaries named \u201cpost-truth\u201d the word of the year for 2016. It\u2019s defined as \u201ccircumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\u201d Cydney Adams is a senior manager of social media for CBS News.

            "article_content": "Legalization of recreational marijuana\u00a0was on the ballot in five states this Election Day: California, Massachusetts, Maine, Arizona and Nevada. \u00a0 California, Massachusetts, Nevada and Maine voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, giving a huge boost to the campaign to allow pot nationwide. Arizona rejected it. In general, the proposals for recreational pot would treat cannabis similar to alcohol. Consumption would be limited to people 21 or older and forbidden in most public spaces. Pot would be highly regulated and heavily taxed, and some states would let people grow their own.\u00a0  Voters in Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas approved medical marijuana measures. State-by-state polls showed most of the measures with a good chance of prevailing. But staunch opponents that included law enforcement groups and anti-drug crusaders urged the public to reject any changes. They complained that legalization would endanger children and open the door to creation of another huge industry that, like big tobacco, would be devoted to selling Americans an unhealthy drug.  Check back here for live updates on each state with recreational marijuana on the ballot:\u00a0  CALIFORNIA: APPROVED California voters approved a ballot measure Tuesday allowing recreational marijuana in the nation\u2019s most populous state, handing the legalization movement its biggest victory yet.\u00a0 Voters in nine states considered proposals to expand legal access to the drug, which is still forbidden by the federal government.  California was the first state to approve medical marijuana two decades ago. It was among five states weighing whether to permit pot for adults for recreational purposes.\u00a0 California\u2019s vote means recreational cannabis will be legal along the entire West Coast, giving the legalization movement powerful momentum. That could spark similar efforts in other states and put pressure on federal authorities to ease longstanding rules that classify marijuana as a dangerously addictive drug with no medical benefits. MAINE: \u00a0APPROVED\u00a0 The vote was extremely close, but on Thursday the Associated Press reported the Main initiative passed. Both Maine and Massachusetts previously voted to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana and to authorize medical marijuana programs. Initiatives on the ballot in Maine and Massachusetts would regulate and tax marijuana in ways similar to alcohol. But there are differences in the way the two New England states would proceed under the respective measures.  In Maine, recreational marijuana would be regulated by the existing state Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.   \t \t \tMaine would allow people 21 years of age or older to possess up to 2 1/2 ounces of marijuana and cultivate up to six pot plants in their homes. Massachusetts would allow an individual 21 or older to possess 1 ounce of pot outside their home and up to 10 ounces inside their homes, and to cultivate up to six plants for personal use.  Maine\u2019s proposal calls for a flat 10 percent sales tax on retail marijuana. MASSACHUSETTS: APPROVED Voters have approved a ballot measure making Massachusetts the first state in the eastern U.S. to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. In Massachusetts, the licensing authority for recreational marijuana would be a new three-member Cannabis Control Commission, appointed by the state treasurer. The commission would be advised by a Cannabis Advisory Board with 15 members appointed by the governor. The Massachusetts proposal calls for a 3.75 percent surcharge on retail sales of marijuana, on top of the state\u2019s regular 6.25 percent sales tax. Local jurisdictions could also add up a 2 percent tax, creating a combined maximum tax of 12 percent on pot products. ARIZONA: REJECTED\u00a0 Arizona voters have rejected legalized recreational marijuana following a multimillion-dollar campaign to defeat it.  Proposition 205 failed Wednesday after opponents poured millions into fighting recreational pot for adults in the conservative state on the border with Mexico.  The measure drew donations from local businesses and out-of-state magnates such as casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who contributed $500,000.  Supporters of legal pot said it would have eliminated black markets, freed up police and raised money for K-12 schools.  Opponents said legalization would increase drug trafficking because growers in Arizona can sell to states where it\u2019s illegal. They warned of an increase in teen use and deadly car crashes tied to marijuana. NEVADA: APPROVED The marijuana legalization movement scored its biggest victory yet Tuesday as voters in California, Massachusetts and Nevada approved recreational pot, making the drug fully legal in the nation\u2019s most populous state and giving it a toehold in the densely populated Northeast. The law would allow possession and use by adults of up to an ounce of marijuana and impose a 15 percent excise tax on marijuana sales, with revenue earmarked for education. Businesses that have medical marijuana certification would be the first to be eligible for licenses.\u00a0  Proponents said legalizing pot could generate $20 million a year in tax money for Nevada schools.   \t \t \tOpponents, including Republican U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, billionaire casino magnate and newspaper owner Sheldon Adelson and many of the state\u2019s top elected Republicans called legalization a threat to Nevada children.",

Before heading off for a Hawaiian Christmas vacation, President Obama publicly acknowledged what U.S. intelligence has been hinting for weeks.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Mr. Obama said that he personally told Mr. Putin to knock it off and vows to retaliate. But the Obama presidency is coming to an end and his successor still won\u2019t accept that Russia is guilty of tampering with U.S. elections. But president-elect Donald Trump is accepting the thanks of those who voted for him.  He finished his thank you tour by paying his respects to supporters in the Deep South.

Kellyanne, I understand you just got off the phone with Mr. Trump. Do he have any news that you want to deliver to us?  KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER: He did say hello to you, John. And he looks forward to joining you in the future as the president in an interview. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Excellent. We\u2019ll hold him to that commitment. Let me ask you about a theory I\u2019ve gotten from some Republican officials this week. This is their theory. Once Donald Trump clears the electoral college vote on Monday, he\u2019ll drop his skepticism that Russia was involved in hacking the election. What do you make of that theory? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0The entire nonsense about the electors trying to use the Russian hacking issue to change the election result is really unfortunate. I think that actually undermines our democracy more than any other conversation that we\u2019re having right now. We were really struck by what seems to be disagreement and consternation between the President Obama camp and the Hillary Clinton camps this week. \u00a0 You have Josh Earnest doing remarkable things from the podium of the White House press secretary -- basically telling us all what Donald Trump obviously knew when he would have no way of knowing that and it\u2019s frankly disrespectful. And then you have his own president, President Obama in his final press conference refusing to go all the way here and say that Russia had hacked into emails that went ahead and interfered with the election or shifted the election results. President Obama knows how to win the presidency. He did it twice. And he did it with states like Michigan, which he won by 10 points, which we just won. He did it by winning states like Wisconsin, which Hillary Clinton-- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Kellyanne, sorry to interrupt. But just on this question of -- Mr. Trump is still skeptical that the Russians were even involved. Leaving aside the question of whether it affected the election or not, you have the CIA, the FBI, the Director of National Intelligence, now a number of Republicans saying it\u2019s clear that the Russians hacked \u2013 that, just as a basic premise is clear. Mr. Trump since late September has said that he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. He still says that now. What does he know that all those intelligence officers don\u2019t know? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0John, where is the evidence? Why, when CIA officials were invited to a House intelligence briefing last week did they refuse to go? Instead, they\u2019re talking to the media. That undermines our national security, our intelligence operations. Why are they doing that-- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0But does he himself have evidence, Kellyanne, that suggests that this isn\u2019t the case? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0Well, the president-elect receives intelligence briefings that I am not privy to. But let\u2019s focus on the issue at hand, which is if the CIA, if Director Brennan and others at the top are serious about turning over evidence to we, the American people, they should do that. \u00a0 And they should show up when the House Intelligence Committee invites them to brief them. But, you know, that\u2019s a closed door meeting. So it\u2019s not so exciting and tantalizing. Because then you can\u2019t leak it to the media. They should not be leaking to the media. If there\u2019s evidence, let\u2019s see it. \u00a0 I would note that President Obama himself the other day stopped short of saying what many pundits on TV are saying. \u00a0And they would have no idea because I\u2019m fairly sure they don\u2019t get intelligence briefings. I\u2019ll tell you what the unintelligence briefing we all know is. Which is that Hillary Clinton and her team spent $1.2 billion, lost an election they should have won, didn\u2019t see us coming. And they got a lot of help-- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0But-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0--frankly from people in the media who are still trying to fight the last war. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0I guess what I\u2019m-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0The campaign is over. This man is the president. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Absolutely. And much more to the point, he\u2019s going to be the president. So what we\u2019re trying to do is figure out how does the president-elect take in new information that\u2019s interesting, that\u2019s volatile, that\u2019s at the center of national security here. So on the one hand, you have the entire intelligence community that says the Russians were hacking the election -- again, leaving aside the question of whether it had an effect. And then you have the president-elect totally dismissing that. So I wonder does his entire team have the same view that there is no merit to the idea that the Russians were involved? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0But remember, you just said the word election. I have to push back. Because that\u2019s what everybody\u2019s doing. They\u2019re conflating whether Russia hacked into the emails and how it affected the election. Read -- I see in paragraph in every story. I listen to people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about on TV and frankly are never under oath. \u00a0 We\u2019re listening to the White House press secretary himself make these allegations. Hillary Clinton is telling her donors that. And I\u2019ve talked to some of those donors. And they don\u2019t believe it. They were given all those fancy maps and graphics that assured them Hillary Clinton would win in a blowout. \u00a0 They don\u2019t accept it. Look, I also want \u2013 I want to say something else. I listened to Donna Brazile on a different network on this morning. And I very much appreciated the fact she seems to be pushing back against President Obama and this idea that after President Obama, as he clearly stated in his final press conference on Friday, John. \u00a0He said, \u2018I told Vladimir Putin to cut it out, and he did. The hacking stopped.\u2019 It seems like she was in disagreement with that. It seems like people in the Democratic Party wanted the president to go further and want him to go further now. And I guess that\u2019s his right. We\u2019ll see what he does in the next couple of weeks. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0All right. We are not going to get any insight into the president-elect\u2019s thinking here, but let me try this. Did anyone involved \u2013 \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: I gave you plenty. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: -- in the Trump campaign have any contact with Russians trying to meddle with the election? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0Absolutely not. And I discussed that with the president-elect just last night. Those conversations never happened. I hear people saying it like it\u2019s a fact on television. That is just not only inaccurate and false, but it\u2019s dangerous. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Does the president-elect-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0And\u2014and it does undermine our democracy. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Does the president-elect approve of President Obama\u2019s decision to retaliate against the -- Russians for hacking into the election? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0The president-elect respects the ability of President Obama to do what he sees necessary in any different \u2013 any number of different arenas. It does seem to be a political response at this point because it seems like the president is under pressure from Team Hillary, who can\u2019t accept the election results. And I would point out-- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0So -- sorry, Kellyanne. I just wanted-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0-- to you, since I know this is meant to -- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0-- make sure I didn\u2019t misunderstand that. You\u2019re saying the president is retaliating because he\u2019s doing it purely for political and not national security reasons? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0John, what I\u2019m saying is that the president-elect respects the ability of President -- the right of President Obama to do what he wants. He\u2019s the president for the next several weeks. We believe in sanctions that work, not just sanctions for sanctions\u2019 sake. But it\u2019s very clear that President Obama could have, quote, retaliated months ago if they were actually concerned about this and concerned about this, quote, affecting the election. Whatever his motives are, what his action is, we\u2019ll respect it as Americans. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0But you-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0That doesn\u2019t mean that new President Trump will agree with it and continue with it. But I also want your viewers to be\u2014to be reminded of one thing. When it comes to Russia and coziness, let\u2019s not forget it was Hillary Clinton through her craven foundation requests -- Bill Clinton got a million bucks to give a speech in Russia. And then she turned over 20% of US uranium rights. So let\u2019s be honest about who for money, and who for power, and who for access has cozied up to the Russians. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Just so I\u2019m not left with the wrong impression, I -- the impression you\u2019ve left me is that you\u2019re saying that President Obama\u2019s reacting here to the Russians because he\u2019s feeling political pressure. Do I have a misimpression? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: No, I didn\u2019t say that. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Okay. I just want to make sure -- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0No, no. What I\u2019m saying is, John, he is under political pressure. Definitely. Because you\u2019ve got people from Team Hillary saying something very different than what President Obama himself is saying -- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0They are disagreeing. And, look, it\u2019s his legacy that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s being questioned here. That\u2019s obvious. \u00a0They\u2019ve lost 1,000 state legislative seats -- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0All right, Kellyanne. We\u2019re going to have to leave it there-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0--they\u2019ve lost the Congress -- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0All right. \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: --many governorships and senators. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0We\u2019ve run out of\u2014we\u2019ve run out of time. \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0Thanks for having me. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0All right.  For analysis on the Russian hacking story, as well as the deteriorating situation in Syria, we\u2019re joined by former Obama National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, \u201cWashington Post\u201d columnist David Ignatius, and CBS News foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.  David, I want to start with you.  On the one hand, you have a president who is saying that he is going to retaliate against the Russians. You have this consensus in the intelligence community. The president-elect doesn\u2019t even believe the beginning premise, which is that the Russians were involved.  What do you make of that pretty big gulf?  DAVID IGNATIUS, COLUMNIST, \u201cTHE WASHINGTON POST\u201d: I was struck during Kellyanne\u2019s just now, as I have been by Donald Trump\u2019s comments for weeks and months, by his reluctance to do what typically happens in national security matters, which is seek some kind of bipartisan unified consensus.  The obvious thing for Kellyanne Conway to say and Donald Trump to say is, I want a full congressional investigation by a bipartisan panel so the American people will know the facts.  Instead, I did hear her say that this call for covert retaliation against Russia, which President Obama said we will take action, I heard her say that was a political response.  It\u2019s the opposite of saying we need to come together as a country and be unified.  I just would note one more thing. In this whole crazy story, the one thing that we really do need to know is whether there is any kind of leverage that Russia has over Donald Trump. That\u2019s the question we couldn\u2019t really uncover because we never got the tax returns.  It\u2019s crucial before he takes office, not to attack him, but to liberate him from any pressure. It\u2019s a really important thing. And I hope -- again, there should be bipartisan support for that.  DICKERSON: Tom, the president has said he is going to retaliate against Russia. What are his options?  TOM DONILON, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Well, he has a broad range of options.  But it\u2019s important to kind of lay down some of the predicates here. And I want to get to something that David. As you said, there\u2019s a uniform (INAUDIBLE). The president used that word -- that phrase yesterday with respect to this.  The DNI, the head of the National Security Agency and private sector firms -- I spend a lot of time in this area, right? We just delivered a report to the president on cyber-security. All agree with high confidence that in fact that Russia actually hacked and released this information for an effort to try in some way to effect the election, right?  So, it clearly should be investigated. And the investigation should put forward to the Congress as they prepare to investigate and to the American people what the facts are, get underneath these issues of intent, and to try to come up with ways in which we can facilitate efforts to prevent this from happening in the future.  I think this is, by the way, part of a broader effort by Vladimir Putin, since he came back into office in the spring of 2012, to undermine Western institutions and Western confidence and to split allies.  So, it\u2019s a broader strategic question, I think, that needs to be addressed here. And that includes, I think, shoring up some of these Western institutions. On the responses you asked me about is that he has a (AUDIO GAP) cyber area, but also (AUDIO GAP) cyber area, but (AUDIO GAP).  The United States has an awful lot of leverage in the financial world, for example, and in the monetary world, where it could act. So, I think that he will consider all these. And, again, I think that\u2019s a pretty broad range of responses.  MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: And I thought it was interesting, because while I heard all the same things you did from Kellyanne Conway, she also she, we want sanctions that work.  I\u2019m not sure if she means sanctions in this case or if that was a condemnation of the financial sanctions that the U.S. already has on Russia. But Republicans like Lindsey Graham are for calling in the new Congress for some kind of pressure. And the administration now is looking at tightening some of those sanctions -- or financial punishment, essentially, on senior leaders in the GRU, Russia\u2019s main intelligence arm.  The problem is, that\u2019s punitive. It\u2019s not prohibitive. And that doesn\u2019t in any way really counter the attack on the cyber-front. It\u2019s merely a punishment.  DONILON: There\u2019s support and I think it\u2019s part of this effort to get out with public attribution with as much information as possible.  I think that\u2019s what the president intends to do. The other thing, on David\u2019s point on -- in 2008, President Bush 43 and his chief of staff, Josh Bolten, initiated a process which we found very helpful. And that was this, to bring the outgoing Cabinet members in the national security area and the incoming Cabinet members in the national security area together several time in the Situation Room to go through key issues and establish facts and get a deep understanding of the actions and programs that were under way.  And, again, the incoming administration will agree and disagree in areas. But it was a really, I thought, very helpful exercise that we were a little kind of skeptical of at the beginning. But it turned out during the course of these things that in fact the world looks a lot different when you sit in the Situation Room, right, with your predecessors, right, and go through the facts and get detailed briefings.  I think it\u2019s an exercise that I would certainly recommend that we do in this case.  DICKERSON: Well, this is what I was trying to get at with, how does the new president-elect take in new information that might be inconvenient -- inconvenient in this case because it puts a little cloud over his election victory?  David, speaking of facts and the way politics play a role, the presidential essentially said in his press conference that Republicans are now thinking more warmly about Putin basically because it\u2019s in their rooting interests as Republicans.  What do you make of that assessment? And do you think Republicans are, because Donald Trump has a warmer view of Vladimir Putin, actually shift, or is there -- where do things stand?  IGNATIUS: I think Republicans so mistrust Barack Obama, that if Barack Obama says Putin is terrible, they will be some Republicans who just take the other side.  I thought the most powerful thing that the president said in his farewell news conference was Russian covert actions against us during our election season have been successful to the extent that we\u2019re a divided country.  We are a soft target. We\u2019re the ideal target for this kind of thing because it\u2019s just so easy to push us further apart. The president was pleading almost, as he has now for several years, to come together.  Again, this is the challenge for Donald Trump is to say to the country, we\u2019re too divided. On this issue, we need to come together as we assess Russia\u2019s intents, on every issue.  DICKERSON: Yes.  Margaret, I want to switch to Syria. What did you make of the president? Outgoing (AUDIO GAP) Aleppo now, the rebel stronghold, is a synonym for hell.  What did you make of Barack Obama\u2019s wrestling with that at his press conference?  BRENNAN: His language couldn\u2019t be more different to John Kerry comparing it to the 1995 Srebrenica genocide days before, Kerry using and coming very close to saying, this is out ethnic cleansing.  President Obama said, yes, I do feel some reasonability, as leader of the free world, when I see this kind of mass killing. Particularly, he called out the images of children that deeply trouble him.  But then he also stepped back and said I don\u2019t have blood on my hands. That\u2019s Iran. That\u2019s Russia. That\u2019s the Assad regime. So, he went back to that argument of what his critics call a straw man argument, that short of military invasion and American boots on the ground, there\u2019s simply nothing the United States can do.  The White House is very sensitive on this topic, because keep in mind President Obama\u2019s the very first American president to say prevention of mass atrocities is a national security priority. And he\u2019s seeing that happen.  And what he\u2019s authorized at this point are largely inconsequential diplomatic initiatives backed with no real leverage. Secretary Kerry has even characterized it as weak diplomacy, though it\u2019s continuing to go on.  DICKERSON: All right, Margaret, thanks so much. Thanks to both of you.  And we will be right back in a moment.  Thanks. Few people knows much as about foreign policy, especially as it pertains to Russia, as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. We sat down with him in his office in New York.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: You have President Obama saying that he is going to retaliate in some fashion for this hacking.  President-elect Trump says he\u2019s not even sure the Russians did the hacking. How do you explain that big gap between those two?  KISSINGER: Everybody has the hacking capability.  And probably every intelligence service is hacking in the territory of other countries. But who exactly does what, that would be a very sensitive piece of information. But it\u2019s a very difficult to communicate about it, because nobody wants to admit the scope of what they\u2019re doing.  And I don\u2019t doubt that the Russians are hacking us. And I hope we\u2019re doing some hacking there. Then what use you make, whether it\u2019s a hostile use, that then becomes an international problem.  DICKERSON: You have met with Vladimir Putin a number of times. What do you make of him?  KISSINGER: He\u2019s a character out of Dostoyevsky.  And he is a man with a great sense of connection, inward connection to Russian history as he sees it. And he is a cold calculator of the Russian national interests as he conceives it, and which he believes, probably correctly, has some very unique features.  So, for him, the question of Russian identity is very crucial, because, as a result of the collapse of communism, Russia has lost about 300 years of its history. And so the question of what is Russia looms very large in their mind. And that\u2019s a problem we have never had.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: When we come back, Dr. Kissinger gives us his thoughts on the president-elect. Back in a minute.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: We continue our conversation with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: What\u2019s your feeling now about president-elect Donald Trump?  KISSINGER: I had not thought of President Trump as a presidential candidate until he became a presidential candidate.  And the first appearances, I thought it was a transitory phenomenon. But I give him huge credit for having analyzed an aspect of the American situation, develop a strategy (AUDIO GAP) against his leadership of his own party and prevailing.  Now his challenge is to apply that same skill to the international situation.  DICKERSON: You told Jeffrey Goldberg of \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d that, with Donald Trump, it could create opportunity, but also serious dislocation.  What\u2019s your assessment now on that?  KISSINGER: Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven\u2019t seen.  So it is a shocking experience to them that he came into office, at the same time, extraordinary opportunity. And I believe he has the possibility of going down in history as a very considerable president, because every country now has two things to consider, one, their perception that the previous president or the outgoing president basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessment of their necessities, and, secondly, that here is a new president who is asking a lot of unfamiliar questions.  And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it. I\u2019m not saying it will. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s an extraordinary opportunity.  DICKERSON: Do you have a sense of what his emerging foreign policy vision is?  KISSINGER: I think he operates by a kind of instinct that is a different form of analysis as my more academic one, that he\u2019s raised a number of issues that I think are important, very important and, if they\u2019re addressed properly, could lead to -- could create results.  DICKERSON: You have advised presidents.  One of the things that voters have said about Donald Trump, since he has no government experience, is that he will be able to surround himself with good advisers. Is that really possible?  KISSINGER: A president has to have some core convictions. He couldn\u2019t get those from advisers.  But he also cannot possibly know everything. It\u2019s in the nature of the presidency that most of the people you meet want something. So, to get objective advice is hard, but that depends very much on the personality of the president.  DICKERSON: What advice would you give incoming President Trump about advisers, about being the president in these times?  KISSINGER: One of the hardest things for the president is to distinguish the routine issues that come through from the essential issues that affect the long term, and not to let himself get sucked into the battles of the bureaucracy for marginal issues, and to keep them focused and to keep his mind clear on what the fundamental things are that he has to accomplish.  DICKERSON: Dr. Kissinger, thank you so much.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Next week, many of you will be celebrating Christmas, instead of watching FACE THE NATION, but we encourage you to set your DVRs.  We will be talking with \u201cThe Late Show\u201d\u2019s Stephen Colbert for a discussion on the year in review. You won\u2019t want to miss it.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Some of our CBS stations are leaving us now, but, for most of you, we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including Graeme Wood\u2019s new book on ISIS, a discussion of President Obama\u2019s legacy with the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, and our political panel.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  President-elect Donald Trump says he\u2019s looking for a simple plan for defeating ISIS within his first 30 days of taking office. But even as ISIS has suffered setbacks in Iraq and Syria, its violent ideology continues to spread. Joining us now is Graeme Wood author of \u201cThe Way of the Strangers: Encounters with the Islamic State.\u201d  Graeme, welcome.  You\u2019ve spent a lot of time with recruiters, sympathizers and -- and supporters of the Islamic State. What -- what have you learned?  GRAEME WOOD, \u201cTHE ATLANTIC\u201d: Well, I\u2019ve discovered that they\u2019re a very diverse group, but they\u2019re unified by a few things. One thing is that they\u2019re idealist. I spent time going to their little club meetings, talking to them over coffee, even playing soccer with them. And I discovered that, first of all, they\u2019re true believers and they have kind of a warped rationality that feeds a belief in a utopian ideal. And that Utopian ideal happens to be a very evil one. They\u2019re -- they\u2019re still dangerous people. But to really understand them, we need to figure out what it means for them to have come to that conclusion.  DICKERSON: What is it like playing -- and you write about this -- but playing soccer, having coffee. By all exterior standards looks like a normal person, and then who has that ideology that you write about that\u2019s so vicious and evil.  WOOD: Yes, I would talk to them and they would say in no uncertain terms that they (INAUDIBLE) my throat to kill, you know, anyone who was -- was standing near us because we were in (INAUDIBLE) Australia, like Norway, like the U.K. And it\u2019s -- it is very (INAUDIBLE) to find that you\u2019re talking to someone who says it\u2019s OK to kill (INAUDIBLE). In the end it was fascinating because these are human beings. They\u2019re people who like to read. They\u2019re very serious about their religion. And they\u2019re very eager, in the case of -- of the people I spoke to, to explain where they got all of that and to tell me what the prophecies said and why I should believe them too.  DICKERSON: And just to make sure nobody gets confused, you\u2019re -- by saying they\u2019re true believers, your view is, when they say this about cutting your throat, they\u2019re not -- it\u2019s not an idle thing.  WOOD: No, the -- they were not kidding around. And one way I can tell that they\u2019re true believers is that in many cases they have acted on it, not necessarily by killing someone, by -- but by, in one case, trying to take a boat to Islamic State territory and now being in jail because of it.  DICKERSON: What\u2019s the biggest misconception people have about the Islamic State?  WOOD: I think people misunderstand about foreign fighters in particular the whole range of -- of motivations and backgrounds that these people come from. They, as I say, are -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re missing something in their live. There is a kind of meaning that they lack. And I think people often think that that meaning or that -- that -- that -- that feeling of lack is because they come from positions of poverty or they -- they feel rejected in their home societies. Often it\u2019s actually because they come from conditions of abundance. They\u2019re -- they\u2019re from rich families in some cases and they find that that is not enough to give them meaning. They\u2019re looking for something (INAUDIBLE) but wealth (INAUDIBLE) that (INAUDIBLE) search of that -- that terrible goal.  DICKERSON: How does a (INAUDIBLE) figure out how to combat that ideology? There\u2019s the battlefield, but then there\u2019s the ideology. So is there a lesson in how to combat it based on what you\u2019ve found?  WOOD: I think there\u2019s some important things that say the president-elect would have to know. I mean he\u2019s said that radical Islam is one of the targets of his foreign policy. And I guess the next step -- step is to find out, what are the differences within Islam, within radical Islam in particular, that motivate people to -- to do one thing or another, and then to understand that this is a pathology within the hearts and souls of individual people who are Americans, who are British, who are Australian, who are Egyptian, and it\u2019s not going to be a problem that is solvable by just going to Syria and stopping what\u2019s happening there. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a problem within people\u2019s souls and that makes it much more difficult to solve.  DICKERSON: Yes, Dr. Kissinger, in an interview he did with Jeffery Goldberg of \u201cThe Atlantic,\u201d said that he thought the (INAUDIBLE) might challenge the new president and hope for an overreaction. What do you think of that theory?  WOOD: I think the -- the idea that -- that overreaction is their goal is -- is absolutely (INAUDIBLE). (INAUDIBLE) operating at 100 percent right now. If they can act, they will. They -- they tell people, don\u2019t delay, just attack as it is, right now, wherever you are.  I also think that it\u2019s important to realize that -- that when they attack, it might not necessarily be a challenge within the borders of the United States. There are allies that -- that Donald Trump has said he\u2019s looking forward to working with, like Sisi of Egypt, for example, who have an ISIS insurgency within their own border -- borders. And overreaction can come also in -- in Egypt, not just through policies of Trump administration.  DICKERSON: And what\u2019s the benefit of overreaction for ISIS?  WOOD: ISIS has been saying about the Trump presidency in particular, that it demonstrates that Muslims cannot have a -- a home in the west. They must move to an Islamic country. So if they can see anything that they -- they can milk for propaganda purposes that shows that that\u2019s the case, then they will absolutely feature that front and center.  DICKERSON: Speaking of which, 30 seconds left. Michael Flynn, who\u2019s the incoming national security adviser, told Al Jazeera in 2015, \u201cwhen you drop a bomb from a drone, you are going to cause more damage than you are going to (INAUDIBLE) good.\u201d Is that in the same category of propaganda victory?  WOOD: I think it depends on where that bomb\u2019s being dropped and -- and who\u2019s the target of it. There are some people for whom there is no solution other than dropping a bomb on them, but it is an ideology that people share and that my book shows exists in countries around the world, in the hearts of people, and drones obviously aren\u2019t going to solve that.  DICKERSON: All right, Graeme Wood, thank you so much.  We\u2019ll be right back with a look at President Obama\u2019s legacy. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: On Friday, President Obama gave what could be his last full news conference. He reflected a bit on his time in office.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I always feel responsible. I felt responsible (INAUDIBLE) snipers. I felt responsible when millions of (INAUDIBLE) displaced. There are places ((INAUDIBLE) happening and because of my office.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: (INAUDIBLE) confidence is that we\u2019ve done what works. That I can prove I can show you (INAUDIBLE) show you were we are now and you can\u2019t argue that we\u2019re not better off.\u201d  I\u2019m here with Ta-Nehisi Coates, who has a piece in \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d for next month and it\u2019s called \u201cMy President was Black.\u201d  In that press conference, President Obama seemed to be saying here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. Does he face a different standard as an African-American president or, we\u2019re in politics, every president\u2019s going to try and defend their legacy.  TA-NEHISI COATES, \u201cTHE ATLANTIC\u201d: Yes. I mean, at this point, no, I don\u2019t think so, because we\u2019re into this, you know, lame duck period. I would say certainly through his eight years, yes, he did. You know, and I think he was very aware of that. I think the people around him were very much aware of that. I think if you look at the way in which, you know, he went about his campaign, he\u2019s very, very conscious of it. But I think he was also uniquely situated for that stand in a way that maybe someone else might -- might not (INAUDIBLE).  DICKERSON: You said he walked (INAUDIBLE).  COATES: (INAUDIBLE).  DICKERSON: (INAUDIBLE) Well, but you put it in this context, right?  COATES: I did. I did. I did.  DICKERSON: That\u2019s part of what writing is.  COATES: I did. I did. You know, what I -- you know, I thought like the whole challenge of governing a country, you know, with a -- a majority white population, and thus, you know, being, you know, the representative of that population. And at the same time having roots in a community which, you know, to put it mildly, you know, (INAUDIBLE) long periods of its history had not been a beneficiary the policy of the country, that\u2019s a very, very, very difficult spot to be in, to be with and to be without, you know, at -- at the same time. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve appreciated how difficult that actually was. I think, as historians go back over this period, they\u2019ll really, you know, begin to see it  DICKERSON: And you carefully trace his unique place within that community that you\u2019re talking about. You said that he said something to the country -- \u201csomething which no black person can but every president must, I believe you.\u201d What gave him the ability to say that?  COATES: Oh, the president is unique, right? And the president isn\u2019t just unique because he\u2019s biracial, because his mom was white and his dad was -- was black. It\u2019s the fact that you had that combination, but he grew up far from the fulcrum of Jim Crow in Hawaii. And on top of that, he had a deeply, deeply loving family of -- of what people, primarily. His mom and his grandparents, who saw no conflict between that love and affirming the fact that -- that he was black. You know, he told me when I was interviewing him that his mom thought black people, you know, were cool. You can sort of, you know, grimace at that or laugh at that, but it\u2019s much better than the alternatives, which many people, you know, who are the result of biracial unions during the time the president was born would have faced in this country. So what he had was a community of white people who were very, very close to him who loved him. As you know as I, you know, said in the piece, he saw the best of white American in the most intimate way possible and thus was able to communicate a kind of trust that, you know, honestly I think African-Americans who we raised, for instance, how I was. And as he said, even as his wife was. You know, have a much more difficultly demonstrating it (ph).  DICKERSON: You have covered him over eight years. He also wrote about this topic himself in his own book. What\u2019s your sense of his arc, of his evolution on this question, that, I mean, he wrote a whole book that was praised before he was ever a politician.  COATES: Right.  DICKERSON: What\u2019s your sense of how he\u2019s -- if he were to write that book about his eight years, what would the journey be that he sketched a similar journey in his own book?  COATES: You know, John, I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s changed. That\u2019s the -- (INAUDIBLE) this is the first time when you -- when you\u2019ve raised that, that I\u2019ve thought about it, but I think, you know, the book is optimistic. The book does have this kind of, you know, measured tone that the president, you know, always takes. You know (INAUDIBLE) in a divisive sort of way, but it\u2019s not a particularly strident, you know, book. And so I don\u2019t -- you know, I think he is who he is. You know, I don\u2019t know that -- that he\u2019s changed much since that time. He did say to me, you know, that he was shocked by the kind of political opposition that he immediately faced when he came, you know, into power, but did that alter any of his basic sense of American institutions or, you know, the American people? I don\u2019t think it did.  DICKERSON: Well, I was struck in his press conference that he ended on hope.  COATES: Yes.  DICKERSON: That he went back to saying, it was what I spoke about in that 2004 speech.  COATES: That\u2019s right.  DICKERSON: What -- and so you have the president saying that and then you have Michelle Obama saying we\u2019re now -- in an interview with Oprah, we\u2019re now feeling what it feels like -- what not having hope feels like.  Hope was at the center of his campaign. What do you -- how do you -- how do you -- what do you make of all of that and this -- and this question of hope that he\u2019s still (ph) hopeful. Is that a -- necessary for politics? Is it a --  COATES: Yes, I think it was necessary for him. And just to, you know, break this up a little bit. I think like the point you just made go back to the question you asked me before about what was different and unique. I don\u2019t know, for instance, the president would say, as the first lady said, that we\u2019re now feeling what it is to be like without -- notice the different, you know, spin, you know, on that.  But it also could be that, as president, like, as a believer of American institutions, (INAUDIBLE) role to speak in that -- in that sort of fashion. So I think part of it is, there\u2019s something within him that angles him in that, you know, deeply optimistic way. But at the same time, he also believes that\u2019s what the role requires, so it\u2019s not, you know, much of an act for him either.  DICKERSON: Does he -- why do you think he wanted to talk to you at such length? You have written about this --  COATES: (INAUDIBLE) --  DICKERSON: Well, to be fair, you\u2019ve written about --  COATES: No, I\u2019m serious. This is not false modesty, John.  DICKERSON: No, I know. I understand. But -- but did he -- does he feel like he\u2019s been misunderstood in the African-American community and was he trying to make a case or --  COATES: See that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the hard thing about (INAUDIBLE). No, I mean if you said like obviously I\u2019ve written some (INAUDIBLE) president, right? And if you took the president\u2019s position, and I\u2019ve never been in -- under illusion about it(ph). If you took the president\u2019s position and my positions, you know, and you polled the African-American community, I think it would come out about 80/20 in his favor. He\u2019s hugely popular among, you know, black folks. So why -- certainly in talking to me, he didn\u2019t need me to interpret him.  DICKERSON: Yes.  COATES: You know, for African-Americans (ph) rub off on me. So it wasn\u2019t that. To be honest with you, I mean the whole time I was going through it, I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know, because he could have picked somebody who\u2019s more in agreement with him. And to be honest with you, I think there were people on his team who felt that way, you know.  DICKERSON: But isn\u2019t that why he picked you, because you weren\u2019t in -- in agreement with him and you\u2019ve been reporting this issue, not just thinking about, but reporting it out. So tell me what your reporting -- where did you start when this -- these conversation start --  COATES: Yes.  DICKERSON: And was it the same place where you ended up? And, if not, what did you discover along the way?  COATES: Well, I was always amazed, you know what I mean? I was always deeply impressed with the president, even when -- even when I was critical of him. You know, as an intellect, as -- as a person. You know, as a piece I -- you know, a piece I wrote in 2012, you know, he was the first -- not just the first African-American president, but the first president who could credibly teach a course in an African- American studies department. I mean his knowledge of -- of race was just that, you know, thorough and that complete. And in addition to that, as I, you know, write in the piece, I saw in several off the record conversations, you know, he has just a deeply curious and active mind. It\u2019s something that, you know, see -- see it at work.  It was difficult to tell when you\u2019re writing from a distance, which (INAUDIBLE) myself until recently, is whether this is sincere or whether it\u2019s an act. (INAUDIBLE) you know, still maintaining, you know, the critiques I\u2019ve had and I\u2019ve (INAUDIBLE). It\u2019s deeply sincere. Its -- it is -- you know, he -- he is (INAUDIBLE). (INAUDIBLE) had to come to, I guess, appreciate that someone with my particular (INAUDIBLE), my particular critique of this country would probably not be president. And I don\u2019t even mean me. I mean like somebody with -- with that, you know, angle. So it left you with this deep question, do you want an African-American president or not? What does that actually mean because it\u2019s not going to be on your political terms. So what\u2019s the worth of it, you know?  DICKERSON: All right, Ta-Nehisi Coates, thanks so much for being here.  COATES: Thank you so much for having me, John.  DICKERSON: It\u2019s a really interesting piece. We appreciate it.  And we\u2019ll be right back with our panel.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Ron Brownstein.  Susan, I want to start with you.  Russia, election, Donald Trump. Kellyanne Conway seems to still be defending the position that Ronald -- that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t believe Russia was involved at all. Where do you -- what do you make of this story?  SUSAN PAGE, \u201cUSA TODAY\u201d: You know, I think that -- that the president-elect seems to be taking the attitude that this is an assault on his legitimacy (INAUDIBLE) election (ph) and is pushing back hard on that. Now, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question he\u2019s going to be -- win the Electoral College tomorrow and is going to be inaugurated as president on -- on January 20th, but that\u2019s the only reason I can think of for him to take such a stance that is at odds with the universal conclusions of our intelligence agencies that we\u2019re hearing that Russia did hack with the idea of affecting our election. Not every single agency or maybe not every single official, I think, endorses the idea this was Donald Trump (INAUDIBLE), although there is an emerging consensus among intelligence agencies that that was the case.  DICKERSON: Ron.  RON BROWNSTEIN, ATLANTIC MEDIA: There is another reason. I mean the other reason is that he wants to reset relations with Russia. And this -- acknowledging this, which -- which, you know, becomes more and more difficult not to acknowledge it, and Kelly Anne Conway was remarkable in -- at one point insinuated that the president was not acknowledging the Russia actually engineered the hack, which is not true. You know, it does make it tougher for him to move policy, I think, in the direction that he wants to move. And I think there\u2019s an enormous incentive -- you know, President Obama has taken the high road (INAUDIBLE), and as Donald Trump, avoided personally criticizing each other. But there\u2019s enormous incentive for President Obama to put out as much information as he can and also perhaps to act before Inauguration Day to kind of create facts on the ground that the next president will have to deal with.  DICKERSON: It was -- and I couldn\u2019t quite make sense of her answer, which at one point said Barack Obama was responding against Russia for political pressure, but then -- then seemed to suggest that she wasn\u2019t. Ron, do you think that after the electoral vote on Monday, Donald Trump -- either Monday night or Tuesday morning -- will send a tweet out saying, the Russians hacked?  BROWNSTEIN: I don\u2019t know. I mean I think -- look, I think, you know, there has been very -- there\u2019s been less difference between Donald Trump candidate and Donald Trump president-elect than you might have expected. I mean the -- the thank you tour. I mean watching that yesterday, the themes of that were so strikingly similar to him as candidate, still aimed at that 46 percent that elected him. If you look at the polling that we\u2019ve had, you know, a variety of polls, Pew, Gallop, NBC/\u201dWall Street Journal,\u201d essentially he is -- you know, he is in good stead with the people who voted for him. He is not getting the honeymoon beyond that that is often the case for -- for an incoming president. He\u2019s still talking to his electorate. You would think that, yes, he would do that because it is an unequivocal conclusion of the intelligence community and at some point it behooves you to acknowledge reality, but I wouldn\u2019t guarantee it.  DICKERSON: Susan, in our poll, six in ten said they weren\u2019t proud of the president, which is another way of talking about the other portion of the county that didn\u2019t vote for him and that is in the hard core camp. He really hasn\u2019t done anything (INAUDIBLE) he\u2019s done the victory tour. He took -- he\u2019s done a lot of (INAUDIBLE) really much to get at that unity that he says that he wants in the country.  PAGE: This is the other thing that I think for the Trump people they really bristle at, the fact that a majority of Americans did not vote for him for president. The fact that Hillary Clinton won a clear victory in the popular vote, although that\u2019s not what counts when it comes to being elected president and this failure to use this period -- this is the best period he could have that\u2019s under his own control to reach out to people who didn\u2019t support him. (INAUDIBLE) that very disputed election the first Gallup poll after George W. Bush was clearly going to be the new president, 65 percent approval, 26 percent disapproval for George W. Bush.  DICKERSON: Yes.  PAGE: You look at it now, it\u2019s 48 percent -- 48 percent. He hasn\u2019t expanded his support among Americans who are inclined, I think as a people to say, he\u2019s won the election, we need to give him a chance. He\u2019s not benefitting from that. And part of it is because he\u2019s doing things like this victory tour that is designed really to rally his own troops.  BROWNSTEIN: Susan, do you remember the first speech after the Supreme Court ended the vote count in 2000. George Bush -- George W. Bush spoke from the well of the Texas state legislature talking about how he had worked with Democrats and Pete Laney (ph), the House speaker. It\u2019s a very different message. And, you know, if you look at the -- look at the cabinet appointees of Donald Trump. They are about unifying the Republican coalition. And while our focus has entirely been on these foreign conflicts with Russia and China during the transition, you look at the nature of these appointees, whether it\u2019s the OMB or EPA or education or energy, we\u2019re going to have plenty of domestic conflict immediately after January -- you know, after he takes office because they point toward a very aggressive move to not only undo much of President Obama\u2019s agenda, but to make fundamental, structural changes in many of the domestic programs that were not, I think, at the foreground of the presidential election.  DICKERSON: Let\u2019s turn for a moment to the president -- President Obama\u2019s press conference, Susan. What did you make of it? He\u2019s still trying to create space and room and give the guy a chance almost to President-elect Trump.  PAGE: Here\u2019s a critical question, what role is President Obama going to take after January 20th?  DICKERSON: Right.  PAGE: Is he going to lead the opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to dismantle parts of his legacy, or is he going to step back, which is what modern presidents have generally done? And I think that\u2019s a hard question to -- to answer at this point.  One thing that struck me about his news conference was how defensive he was. Defensive on whether he should have done more to publicize and push back on Russia hacks before the election too place, defensive, as you discussed in an earlier panel, on whether he should have done more on Syria and very much in his opening statement making the case, I\u2019m leaving the country in better shape than when I found it when I was inaugurated, trying to make the case, I think implicitly against Donald Trump\u2019s argument that everything is terrible and needs to be shaken up.  DICKERSON: That\u2019s right. So will he be Hoover with FDR or George W. Bush with Barack Obama, being silent, basically, about Barack Obama?  Ron, what did you make of the -- of the press conference? He also talked about the Democratic Party and what it needed to do.  BROWNSTEIN: Yes. First of all, I feel that consistently during the transition he is both taking the high road and giving Donald Trump a chance, but also laying the predicate to be more critical and active after -- by being able to say, look, I gave him every chance. And he has said over and over again that, you know, maybe it will look different when you\u2019re president, and I think that gives him a little more leeway to say, you know, maybe -- if it doesn\u2019t look different, that there\u2019s a reason. And, don\u2019t forget, when he was in Lima, Peru, he did not rule out the possibility of being more -- at the APAC, of being more visible.  Look, his -- look, the Democratic Party faces, you know, an enormous challenge. I mean they have won the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential elections. No party in American history has ever done (INAUDIBLE). (INAUDIBLE) a coalition that in some ways is a majority of the national level, but it is not distributed in a way that allows them to easily control Congress, first of all, and now also to win the Electoral College. Donald Trump won the Electoral College fair and square. Democrats have to figure out whether they can find a way to talk to more non-college, non-urban voters, which is where they lost this election, or is their future more in moving further in kind of turning out this new coalition they have, which is diverse, younger, more white-collar and more urban. In politics the answer is usually some of both, but I\u2019ve got to think there\u2019s going to be a lot of Democrats looking at figures, if not literally, like Joe Biden, who can talk to voters beyond the circle where they are doing so well.  DICKERSON: Joe Biden from Scranton, P.A.  Susan, I want to ask you about Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate. Politico had a story this week saying, on some things like infrastructure spending, Schumer\u2019s closer to Donald Trump than Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, is. What\u2019s Schumer\u2019s role in life going forward?  PAGE: You know, I think Schumer\u2019s role is to align with Donald Trump on stuff like infrastructure that he might agree with and which, by the way, has the subsidiary effect of diving Republicans. I think he likes that. But he is also clearly the leader of the opposition. Democrats are divided. They need to decide who they are. They need to develop a new generation of leaders. But their -- their clear leader at this point is Chuck Schumer, who has the only piece of real leverage they have against the president and the Republican Congress, and that is the Senate filibuster.  DICKERSON: All right, Susan Page, Ron Brownstein, thanks to both of you so much.  BROWNSTEIN: Thank you.  DICKERSON: And we\u2019ll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: That\u2019s it for us today. Thanks for watching. Next week we\u2019ll be here with Stephen Colbert and our annual CBS News correspondent\u2019s roundtable. Set your DVR if you\u2019re going to be at church or ripping open those presents when we\u2019re on the air.  For FACE THE NATION, I\u2019m John Dickerson.      (o\ufffdx\ufffd\u0694",

            "article_content": "by Stanley Feldman and Melissa Herrmann Many observers thought this presidential election would be decided by Donald Trump\u2019s polarizing rhetoric, his history of behavior toward women and his questionable qualifications for the office. Instead, CBS News exit polls suggest Trump\u2019s win was in large part a repudiation of Hillary Clinton by a substantial number of white voters. While Clinton did win big majorities of minority voters, she did not get the level of support from those groups that she needed to overcome her deficit among white voters.  There are also indications that Clinton\u2019s gender was a factor in the outcome. The gender gap was substantial. Trump beat Clinton by 53 percent to 41 percent among men while Clinton won among women by 54 percent to 42 percent. Four years ago, President Obama won 45 percent of men\u2019s votes and Mitt Romney won 44 percent of women\u2019s votes. More telling is the gender breakdown among white voters: Trump beat Clinton among white women 53 percent to 43 percent. This was close to Romney\u2019s margin in 2012. While Mr. Obama won 35 percent of white, male voters in 2012, Clinton lost to Trump among this group by 63 percent to 31 percent. \u00a0 As expected, Trump did best among white voters without a college degree, beating Clinton by the enormous margin of 72 percent to 23 percent. Trump also won among white, non-college women 62 to 34 percent and white college-educated men, 54 to 39 percent. Among white voters, Clinton only won among women with a college degree by a 51 to 45 percent margin. Interestingly, among white voters, there is no evidence in the exit poll that income affected the likelihood that they supported Trump.  Clinton needed extremely strong support from African-American voters to try to offset Trump\u2019s margin among whites. She did win 88 percent of the black vote to just 8 percent for Trump. However, this was significantly lower than the 93 percent of black voters Mr. Obama won four years ago. The falloff in her share of the black vote was entirely due to black men. Clinton won among black women by a 93 percent to 4 percent margin. Among black men she won by 80 percent to 13 percent.  Many political observers thought a significant number of Republicans would either vote for Clinton, one of the third party candidates, or stay home rather than casting their votes for Trump. According to the exit polls, Republicans stayed loyal to their presidential candidate. Some 89 percent of self-described Republicans voted for Trump; 91 percent of white Republicans did. In contrast, only 84 percent of white Democrats voted for Clinton. She did win 86 percent of white Democratic women, but only 81 percent of white, Democratic men voted for her. Surprisingly, given all of the attention to Trump\u2019s attitudes and behavior toward women, he did virtually as well among white, Republican women (91 percent support) as he did among white, Republican men (92 percent). Clinton was more competitive among white independent women than men, losing to Trump by a 49 to 41 percent margin among independent women and by 57 to 31 percent among independent men. These were not likable candidates who instilled a great deal of confidence in their supporters. Many voters supported one of these candidates despite significant misgivings. The majority of voters had unfavorable impressions of both. Twelve percent of Clinton voters and 20 percent of Trump voters had an unfavorable opinion of the candidate for whom they opted. So despite their misgivings about the candidates, something still compelled them to support one of them. Both candidates were seen as not being honest or trustworthy by more than 6 out of 10 voters. However, among white voters, 57 percent said Trump was not honest and trustworthy while fully 70 percent said the same of Clinton. Almost 3 in 10 white voters said neither candidate was honest and trustworthy. Among this group, Trump won 52 percent to Clinton\u2019s 32 percent. 13 percent of these voters supported one of the third party candidates.  Voters in the exit polls were asked if each of the candidates was qualified to serve as president. Almost half thought Clinton was not qualified but only 5 percent of her voters thought that. Even more voters, 6 out of 10, thought Trump was not qualified to be president. Almost a quarter of Trump voters gave him their support despite saying he was not qualified.\u00a0  Voters were also asked whether each candidate has the temperament to serve effectively as president. By a slim margin, 55 percent to 43 percent, voters said Clinton did have the right temperament. Sixty-three percent said Trump did not have the temperament to be president. Just over half of all white voters said both candidates did not have the right temperament. While very few of Clinton\u2019s voters questioned her temperament, 1 in 4 Trump voters backed him while saying he did not have the temperament to be president.  Voters were asked how they would feel if Clinton were elected president and 53 percent said they would be concerned or scared. Similarly, if Trump were elected president, 58 percent said they would be concerned or scared. Among Clinton voters, 10 percent would be concerned or scared if Clinton were elected and 95 percent would be concerned scared about a Trump presidency. Interestingly, while 94 percent of Trump voters would be concerned or scared about Clinton being elected, 17 percent said they would be concerned about a President Trump.  If many people had serious doubts about both candidates, is there a way to determine how they distinguished between Clinton and Trump? In the exit polls, voters were asked whether they strongly favored their candidate, liked their candidate but with reservations, or if they voted because they disliked the other candidate. While 21 percent of Clinton voters said they disliked the other candidates, more \u2013 28 percent \u2013 of Trump voters reported that. There appears to have been more people voting against Clinton than against Trump.  Can we say Trump did better than expected in the election because a majority of voters supported his most powerfully articulated policy positions? Exit poll voters were asked whether most illegal immigrants working in the U.S. should be offered a chance to apply for legal status or deported to the country they came from. Fully 7 of 10 voters said they should be allowed to apply for legal status. Similarly, more people opposed building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico than supported it. And virtually as many voters (38 percent) said trade with other countries creates more U.S. jobs as said it takes away jobs (42 percent).  How did Trump win when many of his core positions were so unpopular? Some people voted for him regardless of that. Among those who favored giving illegal immigrants a chance to apply for legal status, one in three voted for Trump. Thirty-five percent of people who said international trade creates jobs voted for Trump. And even 27 percent of white voters who said they want the next president to change to more liberal policies voted for Trump.  One issue that may have motivated some white voters is the ongoing national debate over the way police treat African-Americans. The exit poll asked voters whether they think the country\u2019s criminal justice system treats all people fairly or treats blacks unfairly. Half of white voters said blacks are treated fairly while 41 percent say they are treated unfairly. Among the first group, 8 in 10 voted for Trump. Sixty-five percent who said blacks are treated unfairly voted for Clinton.  With so many tightly contested races, the votes cast for candidates such as Gary Johnson and Jill Stein may have impacted the overall results. The exit polling asked voters they would have cast ballots for if there were only two candidates (Clinton and Trump). A quarter of Johnson voters said Clinton, 15 percent said Trump, and 55 percent said they would not have voted. Numbers were similar for Stein voters, with about a quarter saying they would have chosen Clinton, 14 percent saying Trump, and 61 percent saying they would not have voted. It is difficult to say with any certainty, but with razor thin margins in some states, a small number of voters who might have supported Clinton could have altered outcomes in some states.  -------------\u00a0 Stanley Feldman is professor of political science at Stony Brook University; Melissa Herrmann is president of SSRS",

            "article_content": "In their harrowing new Netflix documentary, \u201cThe Ivory Game,\u201d Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani make the case for staving off the extinction of African elephants.\u00a0 The film -- executive produced by Leonardo DiCaprio -- follows the government officials, journalists and activists looking to stop the poaching and halt the illegal ivory trade that perpetuates it. But it\u2019s an uphill battle. CBS News sat down with the filmmakers at the Toronto International Film Festival to learn more.\u00a0 With a film like this, how do you achieve the sense of urgency necessary in getting your point across? Davidson: Numbers float depending on who you talk to, but we happened to be partnered with Vulcan Productions, and Paul Allen has the great elephant census, so we\u2019ve been going with numbers that have been talked about a lot, but we feel like now that new numbers have been released -- they\u2019re actually a bit worse than we thought. Ladkani: Oh yeah, they were much worse. And what we also realized was that just during the three years we were making our film, 100,000 elephants were killed, so time was of the essence for us to get this out as fast as possible.\u00a0 Davidson: I think most filmmakers generally want a slow roll-out. They want their film to have a long life from the time you get the festival [premiere] to the time you wind up on, say, a platform like Netflix. But for us it was the complete opposite. So we sold the film to Netflix five months prior to Toronto, which has sped up the release of this. Because it really is crucial. We\u2019re at a point right now where if you wait a year, that\u2019s 30,000 to 40,000 more elephants. They can\u2019t wait for our release schedule. One of the points made in the film is that taking guns away from poachers is more important than arresting them. Davidson: It\u2019s more about prevention. It\u2019s great when you catch the guy after the fact, but the elephant\u2019s still been killed. The whole strategy is follow the gun trail, and that\u2019s what they do -- follow the guns and get to the criminals before they get to the elephants, take the guns off the market and save the elephant before it happens. How much has this look at the ivory industry changed your perceptions of signifiers of wealth? Davidson: Probably the most shocking thing that I didn\u2019t know was really just how much this stuff was going for -- $300,000 for a [carved] tusk. Then you really look at it and you think about what this actually is that you\u2019re looking at and it\u2019s horrifying. To know this is going for this much money and it\u2019s going to a very small, elite sector of people of wealth in China is sobering.\u00a0 You\u2019ve both covered other important issues in your work. When you\u2019re doing a film about a certain subject how do you deal with the initial resistance of, \u201cWhy this cause instead of something else?\u201d Ladkani: This one was kind of an obvious one because as soon as I read that elephants are going extinct because of greed and money and that there are giant syndicates involved that are also trafficking drugs and weapons, I was like, \u201cThat is a huge story and completely unheard of and it was something that needs to get out there.\u201d Of course, there are so many other animals at risk -- the tiger, the lion, the rhino for sure -- but you do have to try to make a point with one of them and it has an effect on all the others.\u00a0 Davidson: On the same note, neither of us are pure activist filmmakers. There\u2019s a strong activism component to this, but we\u2019re also filmmakers -- meaning that we have to tell a story that\u2019s compelling and watchable. I\u2019m not going to use the word \u201cenjoyable\u201d because it\u2019s hard to put that word together with this, but it has to have a strong narrative flow. And this is a very, very complex movie. This is an international movie, there are a lot of characters. So it\u2019s a pretty epic, global film when you look at it. We\u2019re all over the world on this thing.  With the release coming up, what\u2019s your hope as far as a response? Ladkani: We have a website, which is not just about the content of the film but the whole behind-the-scenes and the people behind it and their organizations and what they do. We explain options for solutions, so we want people to get behind it, become active and then we want this to multiply so it reaches politicians so they start talking about it. Hopefully, post-presidential election we have the right president that will care. Hillary Clinton would care, we know that. She has been supporting the global fund.  Davidson: You have less to worry about, you live in Munich. Ladkani: No, no, but Europe is a disaster. Only France is banning the trade. All of the others still allow the trade -- like within the country, not cross-border trade. International trade is banned worldwide, but they still keep it alive and they don\u2019t want to ban it, and that\u2019s wrong and that\u2019s sending the wrong message.  Davidson: I think if at the end of the day people watch the film and all people say is, \u201cOh that\u2019s terrible, I feel so hopeless, there\u2019s nothing I can do\u201d then ... Ladkani: We failed. Davidson: We failed miserably. But I\u2019m confident they will say, \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d \u201cThe Ivory Game\u201d is available to stream worldwide on Netflix.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump was effusive in praising United Technologies (UTX) on Thursday for agreeing to keep jobs at its Carrier subsidiary from leaving Indiana for Mexico, saying that the company had \u201cstepped up.\u201d But another factor may have been at work: an implicit threat to yank lucrative federal contracts from the defense conglomerate if it ignored the president-elect\u2019s pleas. Certainly, the math involved in the deal suggests the considerable pressure on United technologies to comply. After all, by agreeing to Trump\u2019s demand that it curb plans to abandon Indianapolis, Carrier is losing more money than it would gain by going south of the border. \u00a0 Carrier has contended that a $7 million tax break from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-public organization, was what made it change its mind about moving all its Indianapolis jobs to Mexico. The deal was brokered by President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is Indiana\u2019s governor and chairs the economic development group.\u00a0 But the company also has said that it would save $65 million per year by shuttering the plant, which makes furnaces, and axing all its 1,400 jobs. Instead, Carrier will now keep the facility open and 1,000 positions in place, with the rest going to Mexico.\u00a0 Notably, however, the $7 million tax break is spread over 10 years. That amounts to $700,000 annually, a fraction of the savings Carrier would glean from transferring all Indianapolis operations to Mexico. In addition, as part of the deal, the company committed to spending an additional $16 million to maintain its operations in Indiana. To former Indiana Lt. Gov. John Mutz, a Republican who serves on the economic development body\u2019s board, a significant factor in Carrier\u2019s reversal was the parent company\u2019s fear of seeing its federal contracts put at risk.\u00a0 \u201cThe dynamics are considerably different than they were even before the election,\u201d Mutz told the Indianapolis Business Journal. \u201cYou\u2019re talking here about a company that is trying to be competitive and also wants to keep their business with the government.\u201d\u00a0 Appearing at the Carrier plant Thursday, Trump told workers that companies would not be able to \u201cleave the United States anymore without consequences.\u201d He added that they would be \u201ctaxed heavily at the border\u201d if they tried, although it wasn\u2019t clear what he meant exactly. Trump said he had called United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes personally to get him to change his mind about shuttering the Indianapolis plant.\u00a0 United Technologies, Carrier\u2019s parent, is the nation\u2019s eighth-largest federal contractor, garnering $6.7 billion from Washington in 2015, which is about 10 percent of its total revenue. Much of that government money is in defense work, such as making engines for F-35 fighter jets.\u00a0 Carrier didn\u2019t say much about its decision-making process to stay put in Indiana, other than that the tax break was a significant influence. \u201cThe incentives offered by the state were an important consideration\u201d in the company\u2019s doing its about-face, the company said in a\u00a0statement. Requests for further comment were not answered.\u00a0 When a journalist asked if the company\u2019s shift was related to maintaining good relations with the new administration, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said the deal \u201cis about keeping American jobs within America.\u201d \u201cThis is about the president-elect and vice-president-elect making good on their promise to go to bat for American workers, which they\u2019re doing, even before they\u2019re actually sworn in,\u201d Miller told reporters in a call. The jobs saved in Indiana, though, are a pittance compared with the estimated 300,000 jobs that on average are shipped yearly from the U.S. to other nations, where the wages usually are far lower. And some wonder whether Trump\u2019s ad-hoc interventions will be enough to stem the tide.\u00a0 \u201cJust lurching from deal to deal will not be enough,\u201d the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. a pro-business think tank, said in a statement, calling for a more thorough strategy to retain high-value jobs on American shores.\u00a0 The reason for the continued allure of shipping American jobs to foreign countries is the stark difference in costs. The average pay in Monterrey, the Mexican city where Carrier planned to relocate, is $11 versus $30 for the jobs that will now stay in Indianapolis, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal found. Carrier has several factories in\u00a0China, employing 2,500 workers.\u00a0 The liberal Citizens for Tax Justice lambasted the deal as a government giveaway to a large corporation already awash in federal favors. Over 15 years, it said, Carrier\u2019s parent paid a 10 percent effective federal tax rate, less than a third of the standard corporate rate.\u00a0 The organization also calculated that United Technologies has $29 billion in cash stashed offshore. Trump wants to allow U.S. multinationals to bring back the money at a low tax rate -- which means, the group said, \u201cthe incoming Trump Administration has decided more tax breaks are a fair ransom for the company\u2019s paper-thin promise to keep 1,000 jobs in the United States.\u201d To be sure, despite the agreement with Carrier, hundreds of jobs from the Indianapolis plant are being sent to Mexico. And another 700 will go there from another Carrier facility nearby that\u2019s slated to close. The company gave no sign it will stop offshoring jobs in the future. Carrier said in its statement: \u201cThis agreement in no way diminishes our belief in the benefits of free trade and that the forces of globalization will continue to require solutions for the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. and of American workers moving forward.\u201d Trump\u2019s clout appears to have tipped the balance in the Indianapolis case, because before he weighed in the company had been deaf to Indiana\u2019s entreaties. In other cases, Indiana government\u2019s efforts to fight the offshoring trend have had mixed results.\u00a0 Since Pence took over as governor in 2013, the state gave  millions in economic development money to companies that nevertheless moved production to places like Mexico and China. Those production shifts have cost thousands of Hoosiers their jobs during Pence\u2019s term in office. The Pence-led Indiana Economic Development Corporation approved $24 million in incentives, with about a third of it paid out to date, to 10 companies that transferred jobs elsewhere, according to a report last summer in the\u00a0Indianapolis Star. During that time, those companies shed more than 3,800 jobs in the state while moving operations to other countries, where labor tends to be far less expensive. Four of the companies returned $746,000 in taxpayer subsidies. But the six others have not, with no consequences, the Star found. Overall, Indiana employers have enjoyed a bounteous harvest of government subsidies, some $483 million, most of it since 2010, figures from watchdog group Good Jobs First showed. Over 80 percent of that came from Washington.\u00a0 Larry Light is a veteran financial editor and reporter who has worked for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Business Week, Money, AdviceIQ and Newsday.",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK - Donald Trump\u2019s election as president has made many small-business owners more upbeat about 2017. Dean Bingham said he\u2019s cautiously optimistic because business picked up at his auto repair shop after the election -- people who had put off fixing their cars have decided it\u2019s time to get them serviced. \u201cOver the last month, customers have been coming in with optimism that they didn\u2019t have the last few years,\u201d said Bingham, owner of a Mr. Transmission/Milex franchise in Greenville, South Carolina. The shop has been so busy that Bingham is looking to hire a seventh employee to help out in the front while he works on cars. While many business owners are more confident because their revenue looks to increase in 2017 due to the overall improving economy, they\u2019re also optimistic because they expect Mr. Trump to deliver on promises to lower taxes and roll back regulations, including parts of the health care law. But owners may not be expecting overnight relief. Many recognize it will take time to see what the Trump administration\u2019s plans are, and what it will accomplish. Business owners were considerably more optimistic about 2017 in a survey taken shortly after the election. Forty-six percent of the 600 questioned in the Wells Fargo (WFC) survey said the operating environment for their companies would improve next year. That compares to 30 percent two years ago, after the last congressional elections.  Just over half the owners said actions that Mr. Trump and Congress will take next year will make their companies better off. Twenty-six percent said the government\u2019s actions would have no effect, and 17 percent said their businesses would be worse off. Nick Braun expects his pet insurance business to benefit because he thinks consumers will feel more comfortable about buying nonessentials like health coverage for their pets. \u201cI truly believe that 2017 will not only be a great year for our business, but the U.S. economy in general,\u201d said Braun, whose company, PetInsuranceQuotes.com, is based in Columbus, Ohio. Braun thinks promised changes to the health care law will be one factor encouraging consumers to spend on things that aren\u2019t their top priorities. He\u2019s also hoping that changes to the law will make it easier for him to buy insurance for his six staffers, which he provides even though the law doesn\u2019t require him to. He says he\u2019s had to change carriers several times because many insurance companies haven\u2019t wanted to write policies for small businesses. Some companies that cater to other small businesses see the hopefulness in their customers, and it\u2019s infectious. \u201cThe election does give me more optimism than I would have had otherwise,\u201d said Kurt Steckel, CEO of Bison Analytics, which does software consulting. Bison\u2019s inquiries from prospective clients, small companies that are looking to expand, have nearly doubled since the election. Steckel is also upbeat about an overhaul of the health care law. He said the cost of his small group insurance rose sharply when the law went into effect, and he had to stop offering coverage to his 10 staffers. He said if insurance were to become more affordable, he\u2019d restore coverage. Among the other laws and regulations that small-business advocacy groups want to see eliminated or changed are the Department of Labor\u2019s overtime rules that were scheduled to go into effect Dec. 1, but were put on hold by a federal court in Texas. Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, fast-food company CEO Andy Puzder, opposes the regulations. \u201cThe decision to appoint Puzder as labor secretary is a big indication that there\u2019s going to be a significant rollback of Obama administration initiatives,\u201d said James Hammerschmidt, a labor and business lawyer with the firm Paley Rothman in Bethesda, Maryland. Federal laws and regulations are only part of the requirements that small businesses must comply with -- state and local governments in some parts of the country have more stringent laws and rules. For example, while the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, many states and some cities have a higher minimum, and some have plans to raise it to as much as $15. \u201cSmall-business owners whose companies are located in more progressive jurisdictions or operate across local or state borders will have to deal with a patchwork of local and state employment laws that may be difficult, time-consuming and likely aggravating to navigate,\u201d Hammerschmidt said. Many owners may be cautious in the first half of 2017 while they wait to see what the government does, particularly with health care, said Walt Jones, owner of a management consulting business, SEQ Advisory Group, whose clients include small companies. He also expects owners who do business with the government to wait to see if federal agencies increase the number of contracts they award to small companies. Jones is optimistic that Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to improve the country\u2019s roads and other parts of its infrastructure will mean more government contracts, and in turn, more business for his company. \u201cAs long as the administration sticks to the promises he made during the campaign,\u201d said Jones, \u201cI definitely see opportunities for small businesses.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump, in a major upset, was elected the 45th president of the United States over Hillary Clinton. He took the stage early Wednesday morning before a raucous crowd of supporters in midtown Manhattan. \u201cI just received a call from Secretary Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cShe congratulated us on our victory. And I congratulated her on a hard-fought campaign.\u201d\u00a0 He praised Clinton for the hard work she\u2019s done for the country, and told the crowd that \u201cwe owe her a major debt of gratitude\u201d for her service to our country. Polls going into Election Day had largely shown Clinton ahead by a few points, though the expectation was that the race would be tight. By early Wednesday, Trump had won 289 electoral votes and the popular vote, compared to Clinton\u2019s 218. Minnesota, Michigan and New Hampshire had not been counted yet, and Trump lost his home state of New York. After a bitterly fought election, Trump delivered a unifying message -- he called on all Republicans and Democrats to \u201ccome together as one united people\u201d and he pledged \u201cto every citizen that I will be president for all our citizens.\u201d It was a remarkably conciliatory speech from a candidate who had employed more fiery rhetoric his campaign and endured few slights silently.\u00a0 \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,\u201d he promised. Trump pledged to fix our inner cities, rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure, and \u201cfinally take care of our great veterans.\u201d\u00a0 America \u201cwill no longer settle for anything less than the best,\u201d he pledged. The U.S. will double its growth and have the \u201cstrongest economy anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump said. And he promised to seek common ground and \u201cnot hostility.\u201d Clinton\u2019s concession call came as a surprise to some of her staffers, who first heard of her call from reporters. Indeed, not long before Trump spoke, the Democratic nominee had dispatched her campaign manager, John Podesta to her election watching party at the Javits Center to send her supporters home and wait for more conclusive results.\u00a0 The crowd, which had appeared worried and despondent on TV screens as the returns for Clinton showed an ever narrower path to victory listened as Podesta told them it had been a long campaign, \u201cBut I can say, we can wait a little longer, can\u2019t we,\u201d he asked. \u201cThey\u2019re still counting votes, and every vote should count.\u201d Clinton and her campaign had been confident of victory going into election night, CBS News\u2019 Nancy Cordes reported. All of the data they were looking at told them she would win. And in the early hours Wednesday, Cordes said her campaign was going over the data again, while also looking for any voting irregularities that might have occurred. Trump\u2019s victory was a stunning upset -- the political neophyte, who thought little of data gathering, the ground game or TV ads, ended up carrying several key battleground states, including states Democrats had little to no expectation of losing. The fears of Trump\u2019s down-ballot effect also turned out to be unfounded. The Senate remains in Republican hands, as does the House. Trump\u2019s dominance was also seen during the primary season, when he knocked out 16 other Republican rivals in his party\u2019s primaries earlier this year, with a candidacy built on the slogan of \u201cmaking America great again\u201d -- a promise predicated on increased isolationism. He has proposed a ban on Muslims from entering the U.S., the building of a wall on the southern border, the tearing up of international trade deals, and the reworking of defense treaties. While garnering only lackluster support for his legislative agenda among top Republican lawmakers, Trump also alienated many for his controversial rhetoric both on the campaign trail.  Early in his primary bid, the New York businessman targeted Arizona Sen. John McCain, his party\u2019s former presidential nominee and a Vietnam War veteran, and said he wasn\u2019t a war hero \u201che was captured\u201d as a prisoner of war. His attacks on his own party elders didn\u2019t end there: Later, Trump lashed out at vocal critic South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham by giving away his personal cell phone number at a campaign rally. Trump mocked the disability of a New York Times reporter at a campaign rally after he contested the candidate\u2019s account of New Jersey Muslims celebrating 9/11.After he became the Republican nominee, Trump called House Speaker Paul Ryan a weak and ineffective leader. During the general election, after Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim soldier who lost his life fighting in the Iraq War, gave a speech at the Democratic convention criticizing Trump, the real estate magnate leveled criticisms at the Gold Star family. \u00a0And of the women who came forward and accused him of sexually predatory behavior spanning decades, he suggested they were lying -- and also unattractive enough for him to even consider assaulting.  Clinton, the strong media and polling favorite to win the election, targeted all those controversies in her campaign against Trump -- to little avail. The Democratic nominee has not yet given a concession speech. CBS News\u2019 Hannah Fraser-Chanpong contributed to this report",

But this week on 60 Minutes, Speaker Ryan tells correspondent Scott Pelley he\u2019s put it all in the past. \u201cWe basically decided to let bygones be bygones,\u201d he tells Pelley, \u201cand let\u2019s move forward and fix this country\u2019s problems.\u201d But Speaker Ryan admitted that he really didn\u2019t expect President-elect Trump to win the election. \u201cI  didn\u2019t see this one coming,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve put last year into a movie script and taken it to Hollywood two years ago, they would\u2019ve laughed you out of the room because it wouldn\u2019t have been believable.\u201d  Now, he sounds determined to look ahead and \u201cstart passing bills.\u201d In his interview with Pelley, Speaker Ryan spelled out his agenda (in the video at the top of this page), listing his top six priorities for the first year of the Trump administration. First on the speaker\u2019s list? Repealing the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to repeal and replace Obamacare because that is really hurting families,\u201d Speaker Ryan tells Pelley. A post-election survey released this week by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation shows that just one in four Americans want to see the health care law, commonly referred to as Obamacare, repealed. What, then do Republicans plan to put in its place? \u201cPatient-centered healthcare that gets everybody access to affordable healthcare coverage, so that they can buy whatever they want to buy,\u201d Speaker Ryan tells Pelley. Beginning in January, the Speaker says Congress will put in place a budget mechanism to repeal the healthcare act while working on a policy to replace it. When Pelley pressed him further, he did say he is hopeful the Republicans\u2019 replacement plan will involve bipartisan support. Speaker Ryan\u2019s top priorities for next year also include rebuilding the military, securing the border, and reforming the tax code \u2014 and that, he says, includes lowering the corporate tax rate. \u201cIt is costing us jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons all these American companies are moving overseas.\u201d Congressional Republicans\u2019 plan is to reduce the rate from 35% to 20%, while President-elect Trump\u2019s plan is to reduce it to 15%. Speaker Ryan says he hopes to end up somewhere between 15-20%. Finding compromise within the Republican party is a problem that dogged Speaker Ryan\u2019s predecessor, John Boehner, but Ryan says he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be hampered by it. \u201cWe are now entering an era of unified government,\u201d he tells Pelley. \u201cWhat John Boehner had to heal with were the tactical disagreements among Republicans in divided government.\u201d Speaker Ryan may not have to deal with the party in-fighting, but one aspect of Congress that\u2019s unchanged is the bell system to alert House members of a quorum call. The only problem is\u2014no one knows exactly how it works, says Ryan. \u201cWhen I first got elected in 1998, they gave us a little card that explained what the bells meant and all the lights meant,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cNo one has that card anymore. Nobody knows what the bells do.\u201d The interview with 60 Minutes took place last Thursday in the Speaker\u2019s office, which offers a beautiful balcony view of the National Mall. Speaker Ryan showed Pelley the sights from his office view, including the platform, now under construction, for the upcoming presidential inauguration. \u201cThe two most prominent things on the skyline from this vantage point are the Washington Monument and the new Trump Hotel,\u201d Pelley remarks in the clip above.  \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ryan responds. \u201cHe actually noted that when I took him up here.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK -- Two state politicians sued on Monday to try to stop New York City from destroying personal records related to its immigrant-friendly municipal ID cards, a move the city is considering to prevent the data from becoming a deportation tool for a new Republican federal administration.  The lawsuit comes ahead of a Dec. 31 date for the city to decide whether to delete copies of the passports, birth certificates, educational records and other documents submitted by more than 900,000 IDNYC cardholders. The date was built into the program from its 2014 start, partly out of concern about the possible election of a Republican president such as President-elect Donald Trump, whose campaign promises included deporting millions of people in the U.S. illegally.  Republican state Assembly members Ron Castorina and Nicole Malliotakis, citing state public-records laws, say in their lawsuit that destroying government records \u201cdue to the results of a federal election is against the ideals of the United States and has no basis in law.\u201d  The lawmakers, both from Staten Island, argue that the information could help to trace cardholders if they commit crimes or obtain municipal IDs under fraudulent identities, perhaps for nefarious purposes.  \u201cAs elected officials, we have a duty to protect our constituents from unlawful government action that compromises their safety,\u201d Malliotakis said in a statement.  Castorina said he was appalled that the program\u2019s authors would \u201cplay politics\u201d with the data.  Asked about the lawsuit on Monday, Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio said city officials wouldn\u2019t \u201callow ourselves to be in a situation where those records would be turned over to the federal government.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe reason people were willing to trust us is: We made very clear that there would never be a situation where it would lead to their deportation, and we\u2019re going to keep that pledge,\u201d he said.  Officials said no decision had been made on retaining the records, however.  Municipal ID programs began in 2007 in New Haven, Connecticut, and have expanded to about 10 cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. New York\u2019s program is the most ambitious.  Officials encouraged all New Yorkers to sign up, but the program was aimed at those without other forms of ID, including homeless people and, especially, the estimated 500,000 immigrants living illegally in the city. The ID would help them do such everyday things as cash checks or attend parent-teacher conferences at public schools, supporters said.  But with civil liberties advocates worried about authorities requesting the data, city law provided for destroying applicants\u2019 identity and residency information at the end of this year if administrators don\u2019t move to keep it.  \u201cProtecting it from a possible Republican president\u201d was among reasons for the provision, according to City Councilman Carlos Menchaca, a Democrat.  City officials say applicants\u2019 documents are carefully verified to guard against ID fraud, and the city notes IDNYC cards can\u2019t be used to get driver\u2019s licenses, board planes or cross borders.  \u201cClaims that IDNYC is being used by those intending serious harm is reckless fearmongering,\u201d mayoral spokeswoman Rosemary Boeglin said.  Some immigrants have said they remain hopeful the city IDs won\u2019t backfire.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "DETROIT -- President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. wouldn\u2019t be moving the production of a Lincoln line from Kentucky to Mexico. Bill Ford, the company\u2019s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! Ford doesn\u2019t have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there.  A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford had been considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. Company spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn\u2019t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It\u2019s possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \u201cWe are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\u201d Baker said in an e-mail. The development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn\u2019t change the company\u2019s plan. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. Ford plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it\u2019s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. Bill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.",

            "article_content": "As the race in Florida tightens, some voters have resolved to support Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race and Republican Marco Rubio in his Senate re-election bid. And while these voters could help Clinton now, they have the potential to haunt her later.\u00a0 Sunshine State voters siding simultaneously with Clinton and Rubio  largely fall into two categories: Republicans who feel they can\u2019t support Trump, and Hispanic voters who value Rubio\u2019s roots. Warren Chase is one of the lifelong Florida Republicans who will vote for Clinton. After having volunteered in seven Republican presidential campaigns, he calls his decision to leave the Republican Party -- and register as an independent -- an emotional one. But also says it had to be done.  \u201cI view Trump as a threat to our national security  from within our own borders. It is that basic,\u201d explains Chase. \u201cThere are times when we all have to take a stand. For me that time is now to  say country first, party second. And to say no to Donald Trump,\u201d Chase says in a radio ad that he made for the  Clinton campaign.  Still, even though Chase has left the Republican  party, he is voting for Rubio, who is narrowly leading his Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy, in the polls. And Chase is not alone. Linda Fogg, a lifelong Republican living in Florida,  has started a group called \u201cRepublicans for Hillary.\u201d The group has taken root, with about 40 members, in The Villages, FL. The location is significant as it is the largest retirement community in the country and a reliably Republican stronghold. Though in Fogg\u2019s  eyes, Trump has been the catalyst for the Republican party\u2019s implosion. \u201cWhen we have a candidate at the top of the ticket  that insults women, minorities, immigrants, our war heroes like John McCain, and mocks the disabled, this individual is not a candidate for president of the United States. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s qualified to lead anything, including my local homeowners association,\u201d  Fogg says with a laugh.  Fogg speaks in lukewarm terms about Clinton and  has absolute plans to return to the Republican Party in 2020. What if there is a Clinton-Rubio matchup? \u201cWithout a doubt\u201d Fogg says she will cast her vote for Rubio. According to Fogg, just about everyone in her \u201cRepublicans for Hillary\u201d group is casting  a split ballot this go-round and could return to the GOP in earnest in 2020. Clinton has a thicker foundation of party  support than Trump does. In a CBS News poll released Sunday, 91 percent of registered Floridian Democratic voters back Clinton while 86 percent of registered Republican voters back Trump. Additionally, 7 percent of Republicans said that they would support Clinton, while 5 percent of Democrats say they would vote for Trump.\u00a0 More than 6 million ballots have been cast in  Florida via early voting, and Democrats have an advantage of about .5 percent in the current totals. Yet voters like Linda and Warren prove that those numbers cannot be interpreted so simply.  \u201cThe numbers now say they are pretty much even  but that does not necessarily mean they are even in terms of votes,\u201d says Steve Schale, Obama\u2019s Florida State Director in 2008. \u201cIf just 2 percent Republicans vote for Clinton than Democrats who vote for Trump that is almost an entire point in somebody\u2019s column.\u201d There is also a group of Hispanics -- Republican, Democrat and no-party affiliation voters alike -- who are going to split their ticket. Sarah Guerrero, a 19-year old Columbian-American living  in Tampa, has given up on the GOP because of the Trump factor.  \u201cI am a female Hispanic immigrant I could not imagine  having a president saying the things Donald Trump has expressed,\u201d she says, in explaining why she is voting for Clinton. \u201cI am heartbroken for the Republican Party. I registered as a Republican when I turned 18...Then Donald Trump.  He just kind of alienated us, at least for Hispanic Republicans.\u201d Guerrero has not given up forever, she hopes that  leaders like Rubio can re-create the party she once identified with. If he gets into the race in 2020, she says she will vote for him. Even though Rubio has said he will serve his full six-year Senate term, Florida Republicans tend to think he\u2019ll run for president again in 2020. \u201cIf Hillary wins, that is the matchup Marco has  been waiting for,\u201d explains David Johnson, formerly the state\u2019s Republican Party interim executive director.  Other establishment Republicans in Florida, like  the former party Chair Al Cardenas, are not worried about these split-ticket voters Clinton supporting her four years from now.  \u201cIf Republicans are voting for Clinton and Rubio  it means they are not leaving the party altogether. If they did not split vote and went all the way with Democrats and left republican party in droves that would be a real problem,\u201d explains Cardenas, an anti-Trump republican.  Some split ticket voters are willing to put it  bluntly, saying Clinton should be weary of losing their support four years from now \u201cYes, she should be afraid,\u201d asserts Karen Diaz Suarez, a 57-year-old old Puerto Rican who is voting for Clinton and Rubio. What about 2020? \u201cIf he runs, we will see.\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "On the campaign trail, Donald Trump vowed to build a wall at the Southern border, ban Muslims from entering the U.S., eliminate gun-free zones, repeal Obamacare, and bring back manufacturing jobs. Now that he\u2019s won the presidency, he may be able to follow through on some of those promises -- but not all of them -- even with the support of a Republican House and Senate, experts say. Trump has vowed to launch his presidency by cracking down on trade deals, immigrants and Barack Obama\u2019s environmental policies, and there are things the new chief executive will be able to accomplish with the stroke of a pen. Here\u2019s a look at some of them. The friction between Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and Trump has been well-documented. But according to a New York Times review of Kelly\u2019s memoir, she writes that Trump was upset prior to the first Republican primary debate in 2015, phoning Fox executives to say he\u2019d heard the first question \u201cwas a very pointed question directed at him.\u201d President Obama and his successor smiled and shook hands for reporters after they met for the first time, but there were a few things noticeably missing -- and they could be telling. Defense Secretary Ash Carter will be with Mr. Obama today when he spends his last Veterans Day at Arlington National Cemetery as commander in chief. Carter has already taken steps to ensure a smooth transition at the Defense Department to the next administration. Only on \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d in his first interview since the election, the Pentagon chief offers advice to the Trump team. Voters in eight U.S. states chose to legalize recreational use of marijuana, potentially \u00a0providing a big lift for the budding cannabis industry. But skepticism about the legalization push on the part of key members of the incoming Trump team, including Vice President-elect Mike Pence, could snuff out efforts to decriminalize pot at the federal level. The leader of the company behind the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline believes Trump will help the project get finished. Trump is a stockholder in Energy Transfer Partners, and CEO Kelcy Warren donated to Trump\u2019s campaign. Protesters from more than 200 Native American tribes have been camped out near the site since August, seeking to have work on the pipeline stopped. Unmarried gay couples who get domestic partner health care benefits through an employer may want to consider tying the knot. A growing number of U.S. companies are eliminating their health coverage for unmarried partners, reasoning that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s move to effectively legalize same-sex marriage makes such benefits moot. The owner of Sears and Kmart, Sears Holdings, could be heading for a holiday disaster. Suppliers may be cutting back on product shipments, fearing that the struggling chain may file for bankruptcy.

Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign\u2019s CEO and former head of Breitbart news, will also be on the White House leadership team as the chief strategist. \u201cI am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cSteve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.\u201d Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager and now a senior adviser to the presidential transition team, hinted at Priebus\u2019 appointment on Saturday. \u201cI think chairman Priebus has expressed an interest in the position,\u201d she told reporters Saturday at Trump Tower, adding that there were \u201cseveral people being considered.\u201d One of the other possible candidates, CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett reported last week, included Bannon.\u00a0 Bannon thanked Trump in a statement for his role with the new White House, going on to comment on his future relationship with Priebus as chief of staff. \u00a0 \u201cWe had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWe will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda.\u201d Bannon, who holds anti-establishment views, has drawn repeated heat over the course of the election for his connections to Breitbart News, the conservative website that heralded the rise of alt-right ideologies this campaign cycle.\u00a0 But Trump picking  Priebus, whose tenure as party chair puts him squarely within Washington insider circles, as chief of staff also signals the president-elect\u2019s willingness to make nice with the Republican establishment. Priebus called it \u201can honor\u201d to join Trump at the White House.\u00a0 \u201cI am very grateful to the President-elect for this opportunity to serve him and this nation as we work to create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHe will be a great President for all Americans.\u201d Trump has heaped praise on the RNC chair for his leadership within the Republican party throughout the contentious primary and general election fight.\u00a0 Back in July, Trump took to Twitter to call Priebus \u201cthe tough one and the smart one,\u201d especially compared to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s then-chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.\u00a0 Even dating back to 2012, Trump complimented Priebus for \u201cdoing a fantastic job,\u201d saying he hoped \u201che gets the credit he deserves.\u201d\u00a0 .@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves. Despite several prominent Republican party members calling for the GOP to denounce Trump throughout the past year and a half, Priebus has remained fiercely loyal to the nominee throughout the businessman\u2019s presidential campaign. In an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d earlier this year, Priebus even urged any holdouts among Trump\u2019s former primary challengers to fall in line behind him -- or face the consequences.\u00a0 \u201cThose people need to get on board,\u201d Priebus said in September. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re thinking they\u2019re going to run again someday, I think that we\u2019re going to evaluate the process \u2013 of the nomination process and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that easy for them.\u201d Priebus has weathered some rocky moments in his relationship with the president-elect. Before Trump became the party\u2019s nominee, he leveled continuous attacks against the RNC and the party\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d primary system.\u00a0 But even after getting battered by Trump\u2019s criticisms, the RNC chair remained resilient, telling \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in April that he didn\u2019t take the attacks to heart.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t take it personally, because I kind of just rest in the truth,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt matters when something is right and something is wrong to me.\u201d CBS News\u2019 Arden Farhi contributed to this report.",

The Loyal White Knights chapter was behind a 2015 South Carolina rally protesting the removal of the Confederate flag from that state\u2019s Capitol.  Trump, the Republican Party\u2019s nominee, was endorsed by the KKK during his campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. The Klan\u2019s official newspaper, The Crusader (one of two newspaper endorsements Trump received) called for his election to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d The Trump campaign rejected the Crusader\u2019s support. \u201cMr. Trump and the campaign denounces hate in any form,\u201d a spokesperson said.

            "article_content": "BEIJING -- China said Saturday its military seized a U.S. Navy unmanned underwater glider in the South China Sea but it would give the drone back. But President-elect Donald Trump tweeted later that the Chinese government should be told \u201cwe don\u2019t want the drone they stole back\u201d and \u201clet them keep it!\u201d\u00a0 We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it! This comes after United States officials had confirmed that they \u201csecured an understanding\u201d for the return of the device. Trump\u2019s evening tweet may extend one of the most serious incidents between the American and the Chinese militaries in years.  The Chinese navy on Thursday seized the drone, which the Pentagon said was being operated by civilian contractors to conduct oceanic research. The U.S. lodged a formal diplomatic complaint and demanded the drone back.  Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun issued a statement late Saturday saying that a Chinese navy lifeboat discovered an unknown device in the South China Sea on Thursday.  \u201cIn order to prevent this device from posing a danger to the safe navigation of passing ships and personnel, the Chinese lifeboat adopted a professional and responsible attitude in investigating and verifying the device,\u201d Yang said.  The statement said that after verifying that the device was an American unmanned submerged device, \u201cChina decided to transfer it to the U.S. through appropriate means.\u201d  The U.S. said that \u201cthrough direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese will return\u201d the unmanned underwater vehicle, according to a statement from Peter Cook, spokesman for U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter.  But Trump, after holding a rally to thank supporters for his election, took to Twitter to criticize the deal. \u201cWe should tell China that we don\u2019t want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it!\u201d the president-elect tweeted Saturday evening.  He earlier in the day had blasted the seizure.  Misspelling \u201cunprecedented,\u201d he tweeted: \u201cChina steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented act.\u201d He later reissued the tweet, correcting the spelling.  China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act. The U.S. said China\u2019s \u201cunlawful seizure\u201d came in international waters. Yet China pointedly accused the U.S. of long sending ships \u201cin China\u2019s presence\u201d to conduct \u201cmilitary surveying.\u201d  \u201cChina is resolutely opposed to this and requests the U.S. stop such activities,\u201d it said. \u201cChina will continue to maintain vigilance against the relevant U.S. activities and will take necessary measures to deal with them.\u201d  Earlier Saturday, China\u2019s foreign ministry said the country\u2019s military was in contact with its American counterparts on \u201cappropriately handling\u201d the incident, though it offered no details on what discussions were underway.  The drone was seized while collecting unclassified scientific data about 92 kilometers (57 miles) northwest of Subic Bay near the Philippines in the South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said Friday.  \u201cIt is ours. It\u2019s clearly marked as ours. We would like it back, and we would like this not to happen again,\u201d Davis told reporters. He said the drone costs about $150,000 and is largely commercial, off-the-shelf technology.  The USNS Bowditch, which is not a combat ship, was stopped in international waters Thursday afternoon and recovering two of the gliders when the Chinese ship approached, Davis said. The two vessels were within about 450 meters (500 yards) of each other. He said the USNS Bowditch carries some small arms, but that no shots were fired.  According to the Pentagon, as the Chinese ship left with the drone, which is about 3 meters (10 feet) long, its only radio response to the U.S. vessel was, \u201cWe are returning to normal operations.\u201d  Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the seizure of the glider occurred inside the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, not China, and appeared to be a violation of international law.  China delineates its South China Sea claims with a roughly drawn sea border known as the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d that runs along the west coast of the Philippines. However, it hasn\u2019t explicitly said whether it considers those waters as sovereign territory, and says it doesn\u2019t disrupt the passage of other nations\u2019 shipping through the area. The U.S. doesn\u2019t take a position on sovereignty claims, but insists on freedom of navigation, including the right of its naval vessels to conduct training and other operations in the sea.  Davis said that the incident could be the first time in recent history that China has taken a U.S. naval vessel. Some observers have called it the most significant dispute between the sides\u2019 militaries since the April 2001 midair collision between a U.S. Navy surveillance aircraft and a Chinese fighter jet about 110 kilometers (70 miles) from China\u2019s Hainan island that led to the death of a Chinese pilot.  The drone seizure seemed likely to fray the already tense relations between U.S. and China. Beijing was angered by Trump\u2019s decision to talk by phone with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Dec. 2, and by his later comments that he did not feel \u201cbound by a one-China policy\u201d regarding the status of Taiwan, unless the U.S. could gain trade or other benefits from China. China considers the self-governing island its own territory to be recovered by force if it deems necessary.  There also have been increased tensions over Beijing\u2019s ongoing military buildup in the South China Sea, mainly the development and militarization of man-made shoals and islands aimed at extending China\u2019s reach in the strategically vital area, through which about $5 trillion in global trade passes annually.

            "article_content": "The following is a script from \u201cPrime Minister Netanyahu,\u201d which aired on Dec. 11, 2016. Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Shachar Bar-On and Alexandra Poolos, producers. On our recent trip to Jerusalem, we found a surprisingly optimistic Benjamin Netanyahu, who has served the longest stretch as prime minister in Israel\u2019s history. He told us his country has never felt as secure or less isolated.\u00a0 But it\u2019s been a tumultuous eight years between Israel and the U.S. over the Iran nuclear deal and the expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. So part of his optimism relates to the election in the U.S. Netanyahu and his followers on the Israeli right, are greeting the idea of President Donald Trump with a resounding l\u2019chaim.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: I know Donald Trump.\u00a0 I know him very well.\u00a0 And I think his attitude, his support for Israel is clear.\u00a0 He feels very warmly about the Jewish state, about the Jewish people and about Jewish people. There\u2019s no question about that. Lesley Stahl: With Trump, do you think that Israel will not be as at odds with the United States as you have been under the Obama administration? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, we had differences of opinion with-- I had differences of opinion with President Obama and most well-known, of course, is Iran. Lesley Stahl: Was it personal between the two of you? Benjamin Netanyahu: No. No. I don\u2019t think so. I think that suppose we had the greatest of personal chemistry, OK? So, what? You think I wouldn\u2019t stand up against the Iran deal if I thought, as I did, that it endangers the existence of Israel? Of course I would.  He says it wasn\u2019t personal but there were times when it sure seemed that way. The relationship, often rocky, hit bottom when Mr. Netanyahu took the provocative step last year of lobbying against the Iran nuclear deal and by extension President Obama in a speech before Congress. Netanyahu in Congress: It doesn\u2019t block Iran\u2019s path to the bomb, it paves Iran\u2019s path to the bomb. So why would anyone make this deal?  Lesley Stahl: When you campaigned against him and you spoke to the Congress, it was read as a lack of respect and something that had never been done before. Benjamin Netanyahu: No, it was not borne of any disrespect, because I have the greatest respect for him.\u00a0 I had then and I have now. Lesley Stahl: But do you regret that you did that? Benjamin Netanyahu: No, on the contrary.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s my responsibility, to speak up when something threatens our very future. He\u2019s says he\u2019s going to see Mr. Trump soon to lobby him to scuttle the deal. The president-elect has called the agreement \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201ca disgrace.\u201d\u00a0 But Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary, General James Mattis, has advised against pulling out. \u00a0 Lesley Stahl: If it were to be abrogated wouldn\u2019t that put you in a more precarious position than you are now? Because they would obviously then rush to the bomb. Benjamin Netanyahu: I think Iran didn\u2019t rush to the bomb before there was a deal. Lesley Stahl: Really? Benjamin Netanyahu: No, because they were afraid of retribution. Lesley Stahl: But if-- OK, you get rid of the deal. Then what? Benjamin Netanyahu: I think what options we have are much more than you think.\u00a0 Many more.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll talk about it \u2013 Lesley Stahl: Like what? Benjamin Netanyahu: --with President Trump.\u00a0 Well, I think quite a few, actually. Lesley Stahl: Because if you, you know, put sanctions back on, the other signatories to the deal won\u2019t. Benjamin Netanyahu: There are ways, various ways of undoing it.\u00a0  Lesley Stahl: You have something in your mind. Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, I have about five things in my mind. Lesley Stahl: Well, give me one. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, I\u2019d like to talk to the president before I talk to the 60 Minutes. Lesley Stahl: What about the intelligence that the West is getting from on-site inspections?\u00a0 Apparently, most of the intelligence community thinks it\u2019s worth keeping the deal for that intelligence. Benjamin Netanyahu: I think we have-- the deal is not the critical thing of intelligence. Intelligence is a critical thing. Lesley Stahl: Which Israel is really good at. Benjamin Netanyahu: Which is-- we\u2019re very good at. And you know, with a little help\u2014 Lesley Stahl: So you don\u2019t think we\u2019re\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: --from our friends. Lesley Stahl: --gaining that much by these on-site inspections? Benjamin Netanyahu: For intelligence? Lesley Stahl: Yeah. Benjamin Netanyahu: No. Lesley Stahl: What about the silver lining? That because of this deal, you now have all this-- these better relationships with your neighbors. Benjamin Netanyahu: Oh, well, that\u2019s true. I would say- I will say this. The only good thing I can say about the deal with Iran is that it brought the Arab states and Israel closer together.  It\u2019s the old proverb: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. On a trip to the desert town of Be\u2019er Sheva, he told us there\u2019s been a tectonic shift: it\u2019s been reported that Israel and the Arab world are sharing intelligence. \u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: All I can tell you is that Israel\u2019s position in the Arab world has changed because they no longer see Israel as their enemy, but as their ally, in their indispensable battle against the forces of militant Islam, either those led by Iran, the Shiites, or-- and those led by Daesh \u2013 by ISIS, the militant Sunnis.  Lesley Stahl: We hear that you have dramatically improved your relationship with Egypt. Is that correct? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Jordan? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Saudi Arabia? Benjamin Netanyahu: No comment. Lesley Stahl: I have to ask you, because it\u2019s the most fascinating of all: Israel and Saudi Arabia. Are you actually developing an anti-Iran alliance in the Middle East? Benjamin Netanyahu: Doesn\u2019t have to be developed. It\u2019s there anyway. Israel is developing a whole skein of new alliances, in some cases with countries that have been challenging the U.S. around the world like Russia which has placed its troops in Syria, Israel\u2019s next door neighbor. Lesley Stahl: How would you describe your relationship with Russia right now? Benjamin Netanyahu: It\u2019s amicable. But the minute Mr. Putin decided to put his military forces in Syria, I went to see him.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cLook, here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. \u00a0I\u2019m not intervening in Syria. But at the same time, if Syria tries to intervene with us, if Iran tries to use Syria to attack us, we\u2019ll stop it.  Lesley Stahl: You\u2019re telling Mr. Putin that you will attack? Benjamin Netanyahu: I said, \u201cWe should avoid this.\u201d\u00a0 And he said \u201cI agree.\u201d\u00a0 So we coordinated between our militaries because no one wants an inadvertent Israeli-Russian clash. Lesley Stahl: You have a friendship with Mr. Putin, and a friendship with China. You seem to be inching toward an anti-American bloc. Benjamin Netanyahu: God, no.\u00a0 Let me tell you something\u2014 Lesley Stahl: Well, talk about that \u2018cause I think there\u2019s an impression of that. Benjamin Netanyahu: That\u2019s a false impression.\u00a0 First of all, there is, there is an irreplaceable ally.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the United States of America. Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but here you are making friends with our adversaries\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: So no. You have relations with Russia and you have relations with China. We can have relations, economic relations, trade relations with other countries as you do.\u00a0 Why not? He has used economic and trade relations to improve Israel\u2019s standing in the world by selling and in some cases giving away its high-tech inventions. Israel boasts of more start-ups per capita than anywhere in the world, many based in Be\u2019er Sheva, and nations have lined up to buy drones, as India has, and cutting-edge agricultural technology, as China has. There\u2019s excitement about a new innovation that extracts drinking water out of air.\u00a0  Lesley Stahl: So this is Israeli diplomacy through technology? Benjamin Netanyahu: Exactly right. Lesley Stahl: Countries that used to vote against you regularly at the U.N., are now your clients. I mean African nations - . Benjamin Netanyahu: It\u2019s a revolution there.\u00a0 We can\u2019t keep up.  What\u2019s surprising is that he\u2019s making progress with all these countries without making any progress with the Palestinians, who\u2019ve lived under Israeli occupation in the West Bank for half a century.  Lesley Stahl: What about the quality of Palestinians\u2019 lives. You know, it\u2019s 50 years since what people call \u201cthe occupation.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s 50 years. You still have checkpoints.\u00a0 People have to be cleared. Soldiers everywhere in their lives.\u00a0  Benjamin Netanyahu: Actually, I\u2019ve lifted checkpoints quite a bit and we\u2019re trying to create bridges and thoroughfares and so on so we can have freer movement. Palestinians know-- they look at Aleppo in Syria, and they look at Yemen, and they look at Libya, and they look at other places, and they know that our intention is coexistence. Lesley Stahl: You told us that Israel is less isolated today than it has been in many years in the past. And yet, at the same time, you\u2019re losing support in-- in Western Europe. Benjamin Netanyahu: Isolated?? All these countries are coming to Israel and it\u2019s a fantastic change. Lesley Stahl: But not Western Europe.\u00a0 Not you, your natural allies, or your older allies yet. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, they\u2019re coming\u2014 Lesley Stahl: They call you colonials. Benjamin Netanyahu: They\u2019re coming around too.  Lesley Stahl: But they call you occupiers. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well they call us a lot of things but I think they\u2019re coming around too, I have to tell you. But criticism has spread, on U.S. campuses too.  Lesley Stahl: There\u2019s a movement called BDS, to boycott, divest, and sanction Israel and its products, because of the Palestinian issue, the unresolved Palestinian issue. And this is the playbook that they used, you know, against Apartheid in South Africa\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, well, I don\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s not about this or that issue. It\u2019s against the very existence of the State of Israel. Lesley Stahl: You know what they want? I know what they want.\u00a0 They want you to stop expanding and building settlements. Benjamin Netanyahu: Yea, well, we did. We stopped. We stopped in Gaza. We tore out the settlements and gave the Palestinians Gaza.\u00a0 And what happened?\u00a0 Did we get peace?\u00a0 We got 20,000 rockets on our heads and terror tunnels.  Still, his critics argue that\u2019s not a justification. For the steady expansion of the settlements in the West Bank. Those settlements are smothering Palestinians\u2019 hope for their own separate state.  Benjamin Netanyahu: I think the obsession, the focus on settlements as though this were the issue and this is the obstacle to peace, I disagree with that. Lesley Stahl: But it is an obstacle. I mean\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: No, it\u2019s not an obstacle. Lesley Stahl:\u00a0 Well, you say that, but they don\u2019t say that. \u00a0\u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, but I\u2019ll say something else. The real reason we haven\u2019t had peace is because of a persistent refusal of the Palestinians to recognize a Jewish state in any border. \u201cYou ask us to recognize you, I\u2019m willing to do that. I ask you to recognize us. Recognize the Jewish state, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d And if they do, this thing will begin to correct itself very quickly.\u00a0  It\u2019s a condition he doesn\u2019t put on his new friends.\u00a0  Lesley Stahl: Have any of the Arab states said they accept Israel as a Jewish state? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah they say a lot of things in various forms. \u00a0  Lesley Stahl: And never actually said they accept you. Benjamin Netanyahu: Do they say it publicly at this point?\u00a0 Not yet.\u00a0  He acknowledges that the Arab states want to see movement on the Palestinian issue. \u00a0 But despite Washington\u2019s call for a halt, settlement expansion has continued, even after the U.S. gave Israel a $38 billion military aid package. Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas recently greeted each other at the funeral of former Israeli President Shimon Peres. But the two have not held open, direct negotiations in over six years, for which they blame each other.\u00a0  Lesley Stahl: What kind of a state is it going to be if you just, you know, don\u2019t do anything? Benjamin Netanyahu: I\u2019m not going to just not do anything. I\u2019m going to do something. Lesley Stahl: Well, if you don\u2019t negotiate with the Palestinians\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, I\u2019m willing to negotiate with them at any moment.  Lesley Stahl: And if it doesn\u2019t happen? Benjamin Netanyahu: I haven\u2019t reversed my position.\u00a0 I\u2019ve said, \u201cLook, we will solve this because we want two nation states at peace and with the proper security arrangements. Lesley Stahl: You would be pushing for a two-state solution if that\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Two states for two peoples. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m focused.\u00a0 Yeah, I\u2019d like to have President Trump, when he gets into the White House, help me work on that.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to see if the Arab states can help me achieve that.\u00a0 It\u2019s a new reality.\u00a0 A new possibility.\u00a0 One of America's most recognized and experienced broadcast journalists, Lesley Stahl has been a 60 Minutes correspondent since 1991.",

            "article_content": "Following a deal struck with the Carrier air-conditioning company to keep jobs in the U.S. in exchange for enormous tax subsidies, President-elect Donald Trump is now taking aim at other companies thinking of offshoring their operations.  Mr. Trump fired off a series of tweets Sunday, cautioning manufacturers that a move outside of the U.S. would be a very \u201cexpensive mistake.\u201d He doubled down on previous claims he will instate a 35 percent tax for those companies wanting to sell their products in the U.S., and also offered another incentive to keep them in the country: The companies, he tweeted, will be \u201cable to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged.\u201d  The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S.  ...... without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ...... wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but..... these companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very ... expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS Last week, the president-elect began the first leg of his post-election victory tour in two Midwest cities, Cincinnati and Indianapolis. In the Indiana manufacturing hub, Mr. Trump celebrated the deal with Carrier, which kept about 1,000 jobs in the state, without mentioning that several hundred will still be moving to Mexico. The air-conditioning and furnace plant, in return, would receive about $7 million in state tax breaks over ten years. The arrangement was brokered largely with the help of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, also Indiana\u2019s governor. Carrier could still face the taxes Mr. Trump threatened against other companies, however.  In an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming White House chief of staff, said \u201cit\u2019s possible,\u201d penalties could still be leveled against the company, considering they\u2019ve continued to shift some jobs south of the border. \u201cIt\u2019s not specific to Carrier,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt\u2019s a position across the board.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s Carrier transaction, however, has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle in recent days. The Wall Street Journal published an editorial on the business \u201cshakedown,\u201d while prominent voices on the left and right also denounced it. Conservative commentator Sarah Palin, a one-time Republican vice presidential nominee, said the administration was unfairly \u201cfavoring one business over another.\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in a Washington Post op-ed, said it \u201csignaled to every corporation in America that they can threaten to offshore jobs in exchange for business-friendly tax benefits and incentives.\u201d Vice president-elect Mike Pence also defended the deal he had a heavy hand in, telling ABC News on Sunday that the administration was not \u201cpicking winners and losers at all.\u201d  \u201cWhat the president-elect did with Carrier was simply reach out one American to another and ask them to reconsider,\u201d Pence said. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement at the Carrier plant Thursday, the president-elect has also trained his Twitter account on Rexnord, a bearings manufacturing plant in Indianapolis which will see a few hundred jobs shifted to Mexico by next year.\u00a0 Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!",

            "article_content": "KAMPALA, Uganda - Scores of people have been killed in fighting between Ugandan forces and a tribal militia in a remote district near the border with Congo, Ugandan officials said Sunday as security forces battled armed men protecting a tribal king who is accused of leading the rebels.\u00a0 At least 54 people, including 41 rebels and 13 police officers, have been killed in clashes in Uganda\u2019s Rwenzori region, police spokesman Felix Kaweesi told reporters. Four police officials and four soldiers have been wounded, he said. The killings are an escalation of a long-running conflict between Ugandan security forces and rebels who are believed to be loyal to a tribal king, Charles Wesley Mumbere, a critic of the country\u2019s long-time president. Mumbere was arrested after the killings, accused of inciting violence, reports the BBC. Mumbere worked as a nurse\u2019s aide in Maryland and Pennsylvania for years, caring for the elderly and sick, before being crowned king in 2009. President Yoweri Museveni has officially recognized Mumbere\u2019s 300,000-strong Rwenzururu Kingdom. Government recognition does not grant any executive power but allows the monarchs to determine cultural and social issues affecting their people. The King of Uganda\u2019s Mountains of the Moon has undergone many transformations in his life - from teenage leader of a rebel force to impoverished student to a nursing home assistant working two jobs in the U.S., where he lived for nearly 25 years. He inherited the title when his father, Isaya Mukirania Kibanzanga, died while leading a secessionist group in the Rwenzori Mountains, otherwise known as the Mountains of the Moon. The rebels were protesting the oppression of their Bakonzo ethnic group by their then-rulers, the Toro Kingdom. The Bakonzo demanded to be recognized as a separate entity and named Kibanzanga, a former primary school teacher, as their king in 1963. Shortly after Kibanzanga died, his son led the fighters down from the mountains to hand in their weapons. Mumbere went to the United States in 1984 on a Uganda government scholarship, attending a business school until Uganda\u2019s leadership changed and the stipend was stopped.\u00a0 Now it appears the peace between the Mountains of the Moon and the Ugandan government has ended. Gunfire rang out outside the king\u2019s palace Sunday as Ugandan troops tried to break into the premises and disarm his guards. After the rebels had killed four police officers, security forces launched an operation to disarm the royal guards and other armed supporters of Mumbere in the region, government spokesman Col. Shaban Bantariza told The Associated Press. Mumbere and some of his supporters are now calling for secession from Uganda, according to Bantariza, who said he had seen copies of money printed by the secessionist group, which is hoping to create a republic known as Yiira. Mumbere has denied any role in the attacks on police posts. The western district of Kasese, where Mumbere is based, is a hotbed of opposition to President Yoweri Museveni, who lost there in the last presidential polls. Some of the rebels had climbed high up the Rwenzori mountains and set up military camps from which they were said to run a small government, even collecting taxes from the people they control. The rebels are armed with modern weapons and improvised explosive devices, according to Bantariza. \u201cThey had shut down life in the areas they occupied,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shall beat those who want to cause trouble on our land.\u201d Museveni, in power since 1986, has struggled to win over the support of the Bakonzo people in presidential elections. There are frequent land disputes in the area, with many accusing the government of sponsoring land grabs. A new plan to divide up Kasese into two parts has also been fiercely opposed. In the 1990s, the area was the scene of a violent insurgency by the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel group that now is based in Congo after being forced out of Uganda.",

            "article_content": "A majority of people in the U.S. said they believe that President-elect Donald Trump will do a very or fairly good job as president, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday.  The poll found 53 percent said he\u2019ll do a very or fairly good job while 44 percent said he will do a fairly or very poor job. His favorable rating has increased to 47 percent, the poll found, while 50 percent view Mr. Trump unfavorably.  Forty percent said they have deep confidence in Mr. Trump to handle the U.S. economy, but 34 percent said they have no real confidence in him on that issue. Half of Americans said it\u2019s likely that Mr. Trump will defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington to get rid of corruption. Close to half, 48 percent, said it\u2019s likely that he\u2019ll build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.  Almost half, 49 percent, said they have no real confidence in him handling foreign policy while 27 percent said they have a lot of faith in him. Twenty-three percent said they have some confidence.  Nearly two-thirds said they expect the economy to be in good shape a year from now and about half of Americans believe the country will be better off by 2020. Forty-six percent said they think it will be worse off four years from now and 3 percent predicted it would be about the same.  The poll comes after a separate survey released Monday found Hillary Clinton received higher post-election grades than Mr. Trump.  The poll surveyed 1,003 adults between Nov. 17 and 20 with a 3 percentage point margin of error.\u00a0 Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "The post-election stock market surge has been getting all the attention. Donald Trump\u2019s surprise victory surprisingly pushed the Dow Jones industrials index to a new record high on hopes of an aggressive fiscal stimulus push from his proposed tax cuts and infrastructure spending. But other markets have been decidedly less enthusiastic about the flaxen-haired billionaire who has shaken the political establishment. Emerging market currencies have been hammered. Tech stocks have wilted.  And, arguably most important, bond prices have plummeted, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.2 percent (yields and prices move in opposite directions). That\u2019s the highest level since January. The iShares 20+ Treasury Bond\u00a0(TLT) exchange-traded fund has dropped more than 14 percent from its July high, with half of the decline coming this week alone.\u00a0 Here are three warnings to be taken from the harrowing decline in bond prices: Inflation is coming The primary fuel for the surge in interest rates (chart above), and thus the weakness of bond prices, has been a jump in inflation expectations. A market-based measure, looking at the relationship between inflation-protected Treasury bonds vs. the regular variety, has increased to levels not seen since the summer of 2015.  The short version of it all is that Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus plans -- coming so late in the business cycle with the unemployment rate already below 5 percent -- are likely to be highly inflationary, according to Capital Economics because inflation and wage growth \u201care already showing signs of accelerating.\u201d The firm estimates his proposed tax cuts would be worth up to $5 trillion over the next decade, while his infrastructure spending plans could come in around $1 trillion over five years. Add in a pledge to increase military spending, build the southern border wall and other proposals, and the economy is set to get a big push at a time when the labor market is near full capacity.  The result could be a more aggressive path of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, further bond losses and higher borrowing costs for consumers.  Trump could blow up the national debt As structured now, Trump\u2019s plans are set to\u00a0double the national debt, per the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, at a cost of nearly $12 trillion over the next 10 years. To stabilize the debt, according to the committee\u2019s estimates, U.S. economic growth would need to clock in at 5.4 percent vs. the 2.1 percent growth projected. And to balance the budget under Trump, growth would need to come in at a whopping 10.3 percent.  Another option would be spending cuts, with a 27 percent drop in spending needed to stabilize the debt. Or some combination of higher growth and spending cuts. The trouble with this, however, is that if we only look at nonentitlement outlays beyond areas including Social Security and Medicare, federal spending would need to drop by half to merely stabilize the debt.  Add it all together, and unless growth more than doubles and nonentitlement spending drops by about a quarter, the national debt will continue to grow. With the debt ceiling needing to be raised by March, bond prices are weakening as traders realize the flood of borrowing will continue.  China and other nations are getting nervous  Another tenet of Trump\u2019s economic plans is his call to renegotiate trade deals, label China a currency manipulator and potentially buy back or otherwise restructure the national debt at a discount. This has resulted in selling pressure in emerging market currencies and equities as investors worry about the economic impact to export-oriented nations.  Many of these nations have been aggressively selling their Treasury bond reserves, contributing to the falling prices and rising yields. Part of their motivation is a need to raise cash to defend their currencies in the open market. And part is the fear of sustaining losses from a Trump debt restructuring and/or higher inflation.  To be fair, the selling dynamic was in high gear before Trump won: Foreign central banks sold a record $346 billion worth of U.S. Treasury bonds in the 12 months through August. But the turnover in Washington will now only accelerate the trend.  Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

            "article_content": "As President-elect Donald Trump considers who should fill the country\u2019s key economic roles, Wilbur Ross is said to be a top contender to lead the Commerce Department. An ally during Trump\u2019s election campaign, the 78-year-old mild-spoken Ross is known for rescuing the types of old-fashioned industrial businesses that Trump has vowed to revive: steel, mining and textiles.\u00a0 Ross is chairman of WL Ross & Co., an investment firm that specializes in corporate restructurings. As Commerce Department secretary, Ross would serve as the country\u2019s chief business promoter and overseer of trade and investment issues, in addition to running such major agencies as the Census Bureau and Patent and Trademark Office. During the campaign, Ross often appeared on business news shows to explain Trump\u2019s positions, sometimes softening or downplaying the candidate\u2019s protectionist trade policies.\u00a0 While Ross doesn\u2019t have the type of lobbying or banking ties that have raised eyebrows with some of Trump\u2019s other potential administration picks, he doesn\u2019t lack for his own entanglements and controversial history. He built his estimated $2.9 billion fortune by snapping up distressed industrial businesses, such as steelmaker LTV.\u00a0 While that helped save jobs in hard-hit Rust Belt states, workers often bore the cost in the form of pared-back retirement and health care benefits. That has led some to label him a \u201cvulture investor\u201d more interested in stripping corporate assets for profit than reviving ailing companies.\u00a0 But Ross rejects the label, saying the companies he invests in would be liquidated without the financial backing. More recently, his rhetoric has also echoed that of President-elect Trump\u2019s campaign speeches. \u201cWe need a more radical, new approach to government -- at least in the U.S. -- from what we\u2019ve had before,\u201d Ross said earlier this year, explaining his support for Trump. \u201cThe middle class and lower middle class in America has not really benefited by the last 10 to 15 years of economic activity, and they\u2019re sick and tired of it and they want something different.\u201d Ross might be best known to voters as the owner of Sago Mine, a West Virginia coal mine where a dozen miners lost their lives in a 2006 explosion. He called that tragedy \u201cthe worst week of my life.\u201d (As Commerce secretary, he wouldn\u2019t oversee mining regulations, which fall under the Department of Labor.) Ross\u2019 own track record suggests that while he has helped some Americans -- including his investors -- he often casts his eyes beyond U.S. borders to make lucrative deals.\u00a0 One of his most successful business ventures was creating International Steel Group in 2002, which was formed from bankrupt producers including Bethlehem Steel and LTV. After taking the conglomerate public, he sold it to India\u2019s Mittal Steel in 2005 for $4.5 billion. At the time, The Wall Street Journal reported that International Steel\u2019s investors earned a 12-fold profit.\u00a0 Ross also has business ties in China, a country that has served as a focal point for Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies. In an interview with Bloomberg News in October, Ross said his company has a joint venture with a large electric utility in China, which he said is an industry \u201cthat\u2019s been getting good support\u201d from the Chinese government. He also said he had recently visited China to scout out more investment deals.\u00a0 Those ties might suggest conflicts between Ross\u2019 investments and Trump\u2019s protectionist policies, which include a 45 percent tariff on imports from China. The president-elect\u2019s rhetoric on trade has included allegations that China is manipulating its currency to make its exports more affordable for U.S. consumers.\u00a0 \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump said earlier this year at a campaign rally.\u00a0 Ross, though, has downplayed Trump\u2019s pledge to tack such a hefty tax onto Apple (AAPL) iPhones and other products made in China, saying the president-elect had been misunderstood and the tariff idea amounts to a negotiating tactic.\u00a0 On other topics, Ross appears more in line with with Trump\u2019s campaign positions, such sharing a critical eye about NAFTA, which Ross wrote in an opinion piece had \u201cwound up costing America over 700,000 jobs.\u201d (The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has said some workers lost their jobs as a result of the trade deal, but the \u201cnet employment effects were relatively small.\u201d) Ross wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment, according to his office.\u00a0 Will Ross actually get the Commerce spot? Trump is keeping his administration picks close to the vest. \u201cVery organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, refuting reports that his transition team has grown chaotic. \u201cI am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\u201d\u00a0 Fellow billionaire Carl Icahn said he approved of Ross as a choice for Commerce.\u00a0 \u201cSteve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are being considered for Treasury and Commerce. Both would be great choices,\u201d Icahn wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, noting that he had spoken with Trump about the appointments. Mnuchin is thought to be a leading contender for the role of Treasury secretary.\u00a0 Icahn added, \u201cBoth are good friends of mine, but, more importantly, they are two of the smartest people I know.\u201d",

            "article_content": "BOSTON -- Athletic-gear company New Balance is distancing itself from a white supremacist website\u2019s call to support it for statements a company executive made backing Republican President-elect Donald Trump.  The alt-right website The Daily Stormer proclaimed Boston-based New Balance the \u201cOfficial Shoes of White People\u201d this weekend after company vice president of public affairs Matt LeBretton praised Trump.  LeBretton told the Wall Street Journal that the election of Trump was a move in the \u201cright direction,\u201d a comment that caused some people who don\u2019t like Trump to burn their New Balance sneakers.  New Balance told The Associated Press late Monday it \u201cdoes not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form.\u201d  \u201cAs a 110-year-old company with five factories in the U.S. and thousands of employees worldwide from all races, genders, cultures and sexual orientations, New Balance is a values-driven organization and culture that believes in humanity, integrity, community and mutual respect for people around the world,\u201d it said in a statement.\u00a0 pic.twitter.com/lXtWlCFkIV New Balance has said LeBretton\u2019s comments were taken out of context. It said he was simply referencing Trump\u2019s opposition to a proposed international trade agreement it also has opposed.  \u201cNew Balance has a unique perspective on trade in that we want to make more shoes in the US, not less,\u201d it said in a statement last week.\u00a0 The anger was sparked by a tweet.\u00a0 \u201cThe Obama admin turned a deaf ear to us & frankly w/ Pres-Elect Trump we feel things are going to move in the right direction,\u201d the company had said, according to a tweet by WSJ reporter Sara Germano. Shortly after Germano\u2019s tweet spread, some New Balance sneaker owners who disagreed with the political sentiment tweeted out photos and videos of trashing or even burning their shoes. The sneaker company later clarified to CBS News that the quote in Germano\u2019s tweet was only in reference to one specific issue: President-elect Trump\u2019s stance against the\u00a0Trans-Pacific Partnership\u00a0trade deal. Still, LeBretton\u2019s comment sparked protests: People opposed to Trump, who has promised to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and has appeared on tape boasting about grabbing and kissing women without their consent, posted social media videos of themselves throwing their New Balance shoes in the trash or setting them on fire.\u00a0 @SoleCollector @newbalance pic.twitter.com/6dROPnmYdm @SoleCollector @newbalance good to know. I made a little bonfire tonight :) pic.twitter.com/yOdCTbQgac Many on social media also called for a boycott of the company.\u00a0 Boycott @newbalance shoes. Buy @TOMS or another righteous brand. The CEO of New Balance openly endorsed Donald Trump. .@newbalance Been loyal customer for many years, but never buying your shoes again. Spreading word! #GrabYourWallet https://t.co/HVj9dqnZdw The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin said he believes New Balance\u2019s support of Trump could be a marketing scheme. But he said the website is campaigning to buy the company\u2019s products and is encouraging others to do the same.  He didn\u2019t immediately comment on New Balance\u2019s statement opposing bigotry and hate.",

The object may seem confusing to many in the U.S., but to those who lived in the United Kingdom during Brexit, it\u2019s a sight they\u2019re very much used to. In June, millions voted for the U.K. to leave the European union, and to their surprise, they won -- with 52 percent of the vote. But while some celebrated, others were left shocked and afraid the break would cause a divide. And they had a reason to be concerned.\u00a0 In the aftermath of the\u00a0June 23 vote to leave the European Union, Britain saw a surge in xenophobia expressed in taunts, threats and worse. The hashtag #PostBrexitRacism started trending, as social media users reported verbal harassment on buses, city streets and in cafes. That\u2019s when the safety pin movement began. Today... and until people I know and love can feel safe again #safetypin pic.twitter.com/c7jphNYhQf A Twitter user who helped start the social media campaign said the object would help inspire solidarity and increase safety. The idea being that anyone against the sort of nationalistic, racist violence we've been seeing could identify themselves as a \"safe\" ally. I quite like the idea of just putting a safety pin, empty of anything else, on your coat. A literal SAFETY pin! Months later, Americans are following suit. Some Muslim women in hijabs have reported harassment and intimidation following the presidential election. Police are also investigating the beating of a man in a Chicago neighborhood by a group who yelled that the victim voted for\u00a0Donald Trump,\u00a0CBS Chicago reports. On Friday, the hashtag #safetypin trended on Twitter, as dozens of people shared selfies with safety pins attached to their clothing. \u201cStanding together we will be safe,\u201d one user tweeted. \u201cMy #SafetyPin shows I will protect those who feel in danger bc of gender, sexuality, race, disability, religion, etc.,\u201d another said. \u201cYou are safe with me.\u201d #Safetypin pic.twitter.com/MGFcjx68BP I've got safety pins on all my sweaters and jackets, on my husband, by the front door.

            "article_content": "BRATISLAVA, Slovakia -- The wave of far-right parties across Europe has been gathering steam from Greece to France, Austria and Germany. While most of the continent\u2019s extreme forces have taken pains to steer clear of Nazi imagery, Slovakia\u2019s answer to the trend celebrates it. Kotleba - The People\u2019s Party Our Slovakia - won almost 10 percent of the seats in Parliament in March. It openly admires the Nazi puppet state which the country was during the World War II. Party members use Nazi salutes, blame Roma for crime in deprived areas, consider NATO a terror group and want the country out of the alliance and the European Union. The party takes its name from its leader, Marian Kotleba, previously chairman of the banned neo-Nazi Slovak Togetherness-National Party, which organized anti-Roma rallies and admired Nazi rule in Slovakia. Thousands have signed a petition demanding that the party be banned. Analysts say the party\u2019s popularity could grow even further. Its simple slogan - \u201cWith courage against the system!\u201d - attracts young people fed up with corruption and the inability of mainstream parties to deal effectively with the post-communist country\u2019s problems. In contrast to most of Europe\u2019s far-right groups, \u201cit\u2019s truly neo-Nazi, it advocates the legacy of the Nazi war state,\u201d says Eduard Chmelar, a Slovak political analyst. Miroslav Mares, an expert on extremism from the Masaryk University in the Czech city of Brno, said the party belongs to the \u201chard core of right-wing extremism\u201d in Europe. He said it has only some features similar to Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn party and to Hungary\u2019s Jobbik at its beginning. What they have in common is targeting the mainstream politics. \u201cThe parties like that are not looking for solutions, it\u2019s all about protests,\u201d Chmelar said. \u201cYou can see it globally. It\u2019s the same with Donald Trump, it\u2019s the same with (Marine) Le Pen in France. What\u2019s important is to be against the system. They\u2019re all riding on a wave of public dissatisfaction that has been growing.\u201d These parties \u201ccommunicate and cooperate with each other, and that dramatically changes the situation in Europe, and that\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Chmelar said. \u201cSo far, there\u2019s no recipe to stop them.\u201d Kotleba\u2019s new party made news by launching patrols on trains in April in a reaction to a robbery blamed on a member of the Roma minority. Parliament banned such activities in October. The party has proposed legislation to label non-governmental organizations that receive funding from abroad as foreign agents, and is trying to get the 350,000 signatures needed to force nationwide referendums on the country\u2019s membership in NATO and the European Union. \u201cAmong our major goals is above all a creation of an independent and self-sufficient Slovakia, that is Slovakia which has an autonomous foreign policy that is not dictated by any foreign structure, such as the European Union,\u201d Milan Uhrik, a deputy chairman of the party, told The Associated Press in a rare interview. Kotleba refuses to talk to foreign media, The AP was told. Speaking in the Parliament building, Uhrik said the EU has been turning into a super state with Brussels in power. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst is that EU legislation is above Slovak law,\u201d he said. NATO is another target. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Slovakia to leave NATO because we consider NATO a terrorist organization. It doesn\u2019t bring peace to the world, quite the contrary,\u201d Uhrik said. \u201cNATO is in fact a military organization of the United States and we are militarily subordinated to the United States.\u201d A celebration of wartime Slovakia remains particularly controversial, but Uhrik says it is not about fascism. \u201cAs nationalists, we cannot reject the first independent Slovak state,\u201d he argued. \u201cWe recognize the Slovak (war) state because it was the first Slovak state, not because it was a fascist state.\u201d On Oct. 13, party members celebrated the 129th anniversary of the birth of Jozef Tiso, a Catholic priest and politician who was Slovakia\u2019s war president. During his rule, some 60,000 Slovak Jews were transported to Nazi death camps. He was sentenced to death and hanged in 1947. Rights activists have submitted a petition with 20,000 signatures calling for the party to be banned.\u00a0 Prosecutors are reviewing that request. \u201cRacism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, Holocaust denials and other such things have no place in democracy,\u201d said Peter Weisenbacher from Bratislava\u2019s Human Rights Institute. Kotleba is not a newcomer on Slovakia\u2019s political scene. In 2013, he was elected the head of a regional government, campaigning on a strong anti-Roma ticket. He promised to have a recipe to solve problems with the embattled minority, calling its members \u201cGypsy parasites.\u201d He defeated a candidate of the ruling leftist Smer-Social Democracy party in a runoff vote despite that party\u2019s chairman, Prime Minister Robert Fico, claiming that \u201ca bag of potatoes\u201d would beat Kotleba. \u201cIt was a shock for me when (Kotleba) won the regional election,\u201d said Ingrid Kosova, a Roma activist. \u201cI remember people were calling me every day saying that they were ridiculed on the streets, they were not allowed to board buses, they were really afraid. Later on the situation calmed down but until now they live with worries and fears.\u201d In a region hit by unemployment around 15 percent, and over 25 percent in one county, Kosova said Kotleba succeeded in poor areas where the problems with the Roma minority are felt, and \u201cwhich he misused to get to power.\u201d When the party won seats in Parliament, \u201cI was abroad in the Czech Republic and I was considering staying there for good,\u201d Kosova said. During the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising against the Nazi rule in 2014, with foreign presidents and other dignitaries in the central city of Banska Bystrica, the seat of Kotleba\u2019s region, Kotleba was flying a black flag from his office and unveiled banners saying \u201cYankees go home!\u201d and \u201cStop NATO!\u201d The Uprising is considered a defining moment of the Slovak history, and for most Slovaks a source of national pride because they stood against the Nazi rule. Peter Gogola was mayor there at the time. \u201cI can\u2019t forgive him that,\u201d Gogola said. \u201cMy grandpa was forced to fight in the Hungarian fascist army and died at Stalingrad. I can\u2019t stand fascism.\u201d Martin Slosiarik, the head of Bratislava-based pollster Focus, said 70 percent of those who voted for Kotleba are under 40. He said most of them voted for him not because they would share his extremist views but because he promised \u201cto deal with the Roma and get rid of corruption.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve learned how to work with the public opinion to create a picture that they\u2019re the only force ready to challenge the current corrupt system,\u201d Chmelar said. He predicted the party could reach more than 10 percent of the popular vote at the next election.",

            "article_content": "SALT LAKE CITY - Utah Gov. Gary Herbert joined officials across the nation speaking out against reported post-election harassment and bullying in schools. A joint statement issued Friday by Herbert and state Superintendent of Public Instruction Sydnee Dickson says such behavior goes strongly against American principles, and the two state officials urge Utah residents to unite and students to \u201creach out in friendship.\u201d The statement advises parents and school employees to take reports of harassment seriously and to be vigilant in reporting instances of harassment. Utah officials join others nationwide in responding to reports of harassment and bullying in schools, especially of minorities and LGBT students, in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election win following a divisive campaign. What began as a series of concerns around reports of harassment in colleges has now spread all the way down America\u2019s educational systems.\u00a0 There have also been reports of the bullying and harassment of minorities after Trump\u2019s victory in society at large, especially of Muslims. In a New York Times Op-Ed on Sunday, Bernie Sanders, the loser of the Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton, said he too has heard of similar reports. \u201cI am deeply distressed to hear stories of Americans being intimidated  and harassed in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, and I hear the cries of  families who are living in fear of being torn apart,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cWe have come too  far as a country in combating discrimination. We are not going back.  Rest assured, there is no compromise on racism, bigotry, xenophobia and  sexism. We will fight it in all its forms, whenever and wherever it  re-emerges.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said Sunday the people generating racist graffiti in the wake of Trump\u2019s election are \u201cnot Republicans\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t want them in our party.\u201d The Wisconsin congressman told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday that, \u201cPeople should really just put their minds at ease. We are pluralistic, we are inclusive... that\u2019s the kind of country we are still going to have.\u201d He said he\u2019s \u201cconfident Donald Trump feels the same way.\u201d Ryan was asked about reports or racist graffiti and hate crimes after Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. Utah Board of Education spokeswoman Emilie Wheeler said it is unclear how many incidents have occurred, but she says it\u2019s enough for administrators to respond on social media and school websites. CBS Salt Lake City affiliate KUTV reports the harassment has been reported on college campuses as well. At Utah Valley University, three copies of a profanity laced flyer attacked what it termed \u201cliberals.\u201d It said those fighting for racial equality should \u201cshut the f*** up\u201d about Muslim rights and gay rights. The Nashville, Tenn., school district said it is providing its counselors with \u201cspecial post-election protocols\u201d to help students in the aftermath of the presidential election. The Tennessean reports that one third-grader sought counseling after a fellow student told him he wouldn\u2019t be able to see one of his two mothers now that Republican Donald Trump has been elected. Metro Nashville Public School announced in a Facebook post and phone message to parents that emotions are running high among students following what many see as \u201cone of the most divisive election seasons in recent history.\u201d The school district said that the \u201csocial and emotional wellbeing of our students impacts their ability to learn and thrive at school,\u201d and reminded families that they can seek counselling \u201cIf you have a child exhibiting anxiety or stress as a result of the election.\u201d Julie Norrell said she found out her son had been bullied at Ruby Major Elementary School through a message from his teacher. \u201cThere has been a lot of ugliness and bullying to come out of this election and I think children pick up on that from TV or their parents,\u201d Norrell said. \u201cThe man that won the election has been modeling that it\u2019s OK to bully people, it\u2019s OK to call people names, it\u2019s OK to be mean. And now, children think it\u2019s OK to be mean too because the president is doing it.\u201d In Pennsylvania, parents received reports of students in one high school celebrating Trump\u2019s victory by yelling \u201cwhite power!\u201d PBS reports middle school students in Michigan were heard shouting \u201cbuild that wall!\u201d during their lunch period. Civility in politics has been declining for years, both a cause and symptom of a changing culture where anonymous verbal assaults are fired freely across the internet, and cable TV routinely broadcasts words once banned from the airwaves. But Donald Trump\u2019s presidential run took name-calling and mockery - things that voters long said they detested in their candidates - and normalized them into a winning political strategy. Now Trump, the president-elect, is calling for unity in words that draw attention precisely because they sound so unlike Trump, the candidate. But many question whether it is possible to reverse the campaign\u2019s damage to political discourse and its ripples out to the way Americans speak to and about each other. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of blame to go around on this subject, but I think in this particular election that an embrace of Donald Trump was an embrace of incivility and vulgarity and insults and bullying, and unfortunately we saw very little public repudiation of that from any Trump supporters,\u201d said Mark DeMoss, an Atlanta public relations executive and conservative Republican whose clients are mostly Christian religious organizations. DeMoss, who abandoned a campaign called the Civility Project in early 2011 after only three members of Congress would sign a pledge to act respectfully, watched the degradation of political speech for years. Then Trump\u2019s campaign, he and other longtime observers say, stomped well past what was thought to be acceptable. \u201cWe can all point to incidents in campaigns across history, but I think this one probably does represent a new place in terms of incivility,\u201d said James Mullen, president of Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, which awards a prize each year for civility in public life. \u201cWhat worries me the most is we\u2019re becoming almost numb,\u201d Mullen said. When Allegheny - which first polled Americans about political civility in 2010 - did so again in October, researchers noted a \u201cdisturbing\u201d decline in those rejecting insults in politics. The number who disapprove of political comments about someone\u2019s race or ethnicity declined from 89 percent to 69 percent. The number who said it was unacceptable to shout over a debate opponent fell from 86 percent to 65 percent. Many observers blame Trump, who called Mexican immigrants \u201crapists,\u201d tarred his adversaries as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d and \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and complained that a TV journalist\u2019s dogged questioning was just a sign she had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever.\u201d He said all of those things, not on long-forgotten tapes, but in front of millions of voters. At Trump\u2019s rallies, supporters followed suit, chanting \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d about Clinton and wearing T-shirts with the slogan, \u201cTrump That Bitch!\u201d Nearly 2,000 teachers surveyed by the Southern Poverty Law Center this spring reported that the campaign\u2019s scorching words were having a \u201cprofoundly negative impact\u201d on their students. More than half said they had seen an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose race, religion or nationality had been targeted by political rhetoric. The survey did not identify any candidates. But teachers singled out Trump in more than 1,000 comments, while fewer than 200 combined named Clinton, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. In recent years, teachers mindful of bullying and taunts on social media have worked to make schools places of mutual respect, said Maureen Costello, director of the SPLC\u2019s Teaching Tolerance project. \u201cWhat made this year really different is that it broke through that protective moat,\u201d Costello said. The political rhetoric was \u201cso ubiquitous and so saturated the culture that you couldn\u2019t keep it out of schools. Kids are sponges.\u201d When Beth Ferris, a middle school teacher in Yucca Valley, California, told students on Election Day that history would be made one way or the other, one of her students said, \u201cYeah, she (Clinton) should be in jail!\u201d At a nearby high school, vandals painted \u201cTrump 2016,\u201d on a wall and covered the word \u201cGirls\u201d on a bathroom door with a vulgarity. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d Ferris said. On the day after the election, teacher Dee Burek said fifth and sixth graders in her Allentown, New Jersey, middle school asked how Trump had become the Republican nominee. She recalled his insults of opponents in debates and how they stuck. \u201cThe kids just kind of looked at me and said, \u2018But that doesn\u2019t make any sense. That\u2019s bullying,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf these middle schoolers can see that, I think there\u2019s hope.\u201d",

The \u201cGirls\u201d star recalls saying, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to go this way\u201d when Donald Trump clinched the presidency, she wrote in an essay for her Lenny website published Friday. The essay marked her first public statement -- aside from a tweet honoring the late Leonard Cohen -- Dunham made since Election Day. \u201cAs horrifying as I found Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric, as hideous as I found his racism and xenophobia, as threatening to basic decency as I found his demagogue persona, I never truly believed he could win,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0 But win he did, something that became clearer and clearer on Tuesday night. \u201cThe three hours I spent at the Javits Center Tuesday night, surrounded by campaign staffers and fellow surrogates for Hillary Clinton, are blurred and spotty,\u201d Dunham recalled. \u201cAt a certain point it became clear something had gone horribly wrong.\u201d Dunham also looked back on the vitriol and abuse she and other Clinton supporters withstood over the course of her time working for the campaign. \u201cI received threats and abuse at a level I could not have imagined,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy Twitter mentions went from rude to downright violent. My phone was hacked, and I was sent images of aborted fetuses, weapons. I was called a fat whore, a retard, told I should be killed in front of everyone who knew me.\u201d \u201cMy experience mimics that of so many women who organized for Hillary Clinton and against Donald Trump, most of them not celebrities. We wanted a female president. We wanted guaranteed control over our own bodies. We wanted equal pay. That made us nasty. That made us targets.\u201d Dunham ended her essay calling for action, for those who opposed Trump to fight back.\u00a0 \u201cIn this new reality, we have all been radicalized. It\u2019s no longer a word for those living on the fringes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a word for everyone who walks in pain with the results of this election, who feels their identity being crushed under the weight of the half of the country who voted for a man who denounces and denies the basic rights of women, the queer community, immigrants, Muslims, people of color and the differently abled.\u201d She also offered a message of hope: \u201cWe will not be governed by fear. We will show our children a different way. We will go home like shooting stars.\u201d Ned Ehrbar is an entertainment producer for CBS News.",

Bernie Sanders said Sunday that President-elect Donald Trump won the election fair and square\u2014and that Democrats must now focus on holding him \u201caccountable.\u201d \u201cHe won the election,\u201d Sanders told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cI did everything I could to see that he not become elected, but he won. Our job now is to hold him accountable.\u201d The Vermont senator and former 2016 hopeful said there\u2019s some common ground to be had with Trump, who tapped into the anger and frustration among the white working class in the United States. Sanders, too, struck a chord with many voters this year with his criticism of the country\u2019s elite. \u201cIf Mr. Trump in fact has the courage to take on Wall Street, to take on the drug companies, to try to go forward to create a better life for working people we will work with him on issue by issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if his presidency is going to be about discrimination, if it\u2019s going to be about scapegoating immigrants or scapegoating African Americans or Muslims, we will oppose him vigorously.\u201d The next question for Democrats, Sanders said, is to try to understand why their message is losing at the ballot box not just for the White House, but for state and local offices around the country -- and said the \u201cliberal elite\u201d and their focus on high-dollar fundraising plays a role. \u201cHow does it happen that they win elections and Democrats lose?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd I think what the conclusion is Democrats have focused too much with a liberal elite which is raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people in the upper middle class but has ignored to a very significant degree the working class and the middle class and low-income people in this country.\u201d Trump himself, Sanders added, is part of the reason Democrats lost: he has \u201cvery, very good political instincts.\u201d \u201cWhat he understood, which many Democrats did not, which is if you are an average American out there making $30, 40, 50 thousand dollars a year \u2026 \u00a0you know what, John, you\u2019re pissed off, you\u2019re not happy about it, you\u2019re seeing your jobs to go to China,\u201d Sanders said. Asked who was now the de facto head of the Democratic Party, Sanders replied: \u201cI\u2019m not into leaders.\u201d He has backed Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minnesota) as the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee -- a position that will ultimately say a lot about the future direction of the party. \u201cI am into building a movement which transforms this country and brings people together around an agenda that works for the middle class and working families,\u201d he said. Sanders\u2019 question for Trump now, he said, is whether he will actually do something to make good on his promises to help the country\u2019s frustrated working class.  \u201cYou talked about being the champion of the working families -- all right now produce. Your rhetoric was great, now do something,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will not accept racism, we will not accept sexism or xenophobia.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "PORTLAND, Ore. -- As protests of President-elect Donald Trump entered another day, police in Portland, Oregon, say one person was shot and injured by a man who had gotten into a confrontation with a protester and then opened fire. Portland police said the victim was taken to a hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries and they were looking for a male suspect, who got out of a vehicle and fired multiple shots early Saturday morning on a Willamette River bridge before fleeing in the vehicle. The shooting followed rowdy Friday night protests, when police used tear gas in response to \u201cburning projectiles\u201d thrown at officers, police said on Twitter. Hundreds of people marched through the city, disrupting traffic and spray-painting graffiti. Authorities reported instances of vandalism and assault during a rally that organizers had billed as peaceful earlier in the day. Anger over the election has had some violent and ugly results, CBS News correspondent Marlie Hall reports. A video posted to social media shows David Wilcox, a white Trump supporter, being beaten by a group of African-Americans following a traffic dispute in Chicago. \u201cSomebody yelled, \u2018That\u2019s one of them white boy Trump supporters,\u2019 and then I said, \u2018What does that have to do with this? We\u2019re talking about insurance here,\u2019\u201d Wilcox told CBS station WBBM-TV. \u201cAnd I asked the lady, \u2018Ma\u2019am, do you have insurance?\u2019 and immediately punches were thrown. They didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d But the coarseness goes both ways. Chants of \u201cwhite power\u201d were heard from students holding a Trump-Pence campaign sign at a school in York, Pennsylvania. And middle schoolers in Michigan chanted \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d leaving Latino students in tears. Reaction from the school district was swift. \u201cThis is not who we are,\u201d said Principal Todd Noonan. \u201cEveryone is welcome in our community of learners. We build bridges. We work together.\u201d In other parts of the country, spirited demonstrations on college campuses and peaceful marches along downtown streets have taken place since Wednesday. Hundreds joined a Friday afternoon \u201clove rally\u201d in Washington Square Park in Manhattan. Leslie Holmes, 65, a website developer from Wilton, Connecticut, took an hour-long train ride to the demonstration - her first protest since the 1970s, when she hit the streets of San Francisco to oppose the Vietnam War. She described herself as an armchair liberal but declared, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be armchair anymore.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a country where my friends aren\u2019t included, and my friends are fearful, and my children are going to grow up in a world that\u2019s frightening, and my granddaughters can look forward to being excluded from jobs and politics and fulfilling their potential, so I\u2019m here for them,\u201d she said. Evening marches disrupted traffic in Miami and Atlanta. Trump supporter Nicolas Quirico was traveling from South Beach to Miami. His car was among hundreds stopped when protesters blocked Interstate 395. \u201cTrump will be our president. There is no way around that, and the sooner people grasp that, the better off we will be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a difference between a peaceful protest and standing in a major highway backing up traffic for 5 miles. This is wrong.\u201d More than a thousand protesters took to the streets across California after night fell including downtown Los Angeles, where over 200 were arrested a night earlier. In Bakersfield, where Trump is far more popular than in most of the state, some held signs reading \u201cAnti-Trump, Pro-USA.\u201d Small protests also were held in Detroit; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Olympia, Washington and Iowa City. More than 200 people carrying signs gathered on the steps of the Washington state Capitol. The group chanted \u201cnot my president\u201d and \u201cno Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\u201d In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic. A protest also occurred in Minneapolis. In Chicago, multiple groups planned protests through Saturday. Nadia Gavino, 25, learned about the rallies on Twitter and protested Thursday evening. Gavino, whose father is from Peru and whose mother is of Mexican and Lithuanian heritage, said she took Trump\u2019s harshest statements about immigrants and Latinos personally. \u201cI obviously agree that he\u2019s racist, he\u2019s sexist, he\u2019s phobic, he\u2019s misogynistic. He\u2019s all these things you don\u2019t want in a leader,\u201d she said. Ashley Lynne Nagel, 27, said she joined a Thursday night demonstration in Denver. \u201cI have a leader I fear for the first time in my life,\u201d said Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re sore losers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation.\u201d Demonstrations also were planned Saturday in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other areas. Previous demonstrations drew thousands of people in New York and other large urban centers. The largely peaceful demonstrations were overshadowed by sporadic episodes of vandalism, violence and street-blocking.",

Video: learn more about our Word of the Year and shortlist from dictionaries editor Jonathan Dent: https://t.co/yl588Txkrg In Britain, the campaign to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, was marked by numerous factual evasions and missteps. Yet the side that appeared to use truth more loosely won, much like Mr. Trump. The Oxford Dictionaries says the word is used an adjective, and is mostly associated with \u201cpost-truth politics.\u201d \u201cPost-truth has gone from being a peripheral term to being a mainstay in political commentary, now often being used by major publications without the need for clarification or definition in their headlines,\u201d the company said in a statement. The term post-truth calls to mind 2006\u2019s word of the year for some dictionaries: \u201ctruthiness.\u201d Stephen Colbert is popularly credited with coining that term, deploying it repeatedly when talking about the Bush administration\u2019s military operation in Iraq.\u00a0 However, Katherine Connor Martin, the head of United States dictionaries at Oxford University Press, told the New York Times: \u201cTruthiness is a humorous way of discussing a quality of specific  claims. Post-truth is an adjective that is describing a much  bigger thing. It\u2019s saying that the truth is being regarded as mostly  irrelevant.\u201d Both \u201ctruthiness\u201d and \u201cpost-truth\u201d weren\u2019t invented to describe the political climate in which they were frequently invoked. Linguists have found older uses of both words, and instead attribute their recent rise in popularity to people looking for accurate descriptions of their apparent political consternation. The election of Donald Trump has also given rise to other curiosities and discoveries in the English language. Merriam-Webster reports that the most searched-for words following Mr. Trump\u2019s victory were, in order: fascism, bigot, xenophobe, racism, socialism, resurgence, xenophobia, and misogyny. All of those ideas were central talking points in the rhetoric of both presidential campaigns, whether as accusations or denials. Runners-up for the 2016 word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries include \u201cBrexiteer,\u201d which is an advocate of the U.K. leaving the EU; \u201calt-right,\u201d which is an extreme, conservative, mostly online political movement; \u201cadulting,\u201d which is the practice of behaving in a way characteristic of a responsible adult; and \u201cwoke,\u201d an adjective in America used informally to describe a person\u2019s awareness towards injustice in society, especially racism. The seriousness of the words defining 2016 stand a far cry from 2015, when Oxford Dictionaries chose a smiling, crying emoji as its word of the year.

            "article_content": "There were protests in both major and smaller cities throughout the U.S. on Friday, for the third consecutive night after President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory.\u00a0 As the fourth night of protests over the election of Donald Trump roiled the city of Portland, marchers and anarchists blocked streets, forced freeways to close and interrupted bridge traffic. Around 8:40 p.m., ODOT closed the northbound I-5 at the Marquam Bridge, the southbound I-5 at the Fremont Bridge and I-84 at the I-5 junction. Later, police tweeted they were working with ODOT and officials at the Moda Center to help with traffic leaving the Blazers game. Thousands of protesters were seen in various spots throughout the city, as the protest grew from a small but peaceful gathering at City Hall that began around 5 p.m. Police repeatedly used a bullhorn to tell the protesters they were \u201cparticipating in an unlawful protest,\u201d and had been seen committing \u201cvandalism and assault.\u201d If they didn\u2019t move, the police said, the protesters were \u201csubject to use of force\u201d and \u201carrest and prosecution. Move now!\u201d Instead, the protesters stayed and took cell-phone videos. Despite the police orders, the protesters moved onto SW 3rd and walked against traffic, creating chaos, traffic delays and confusion. Police blocked them from getting on the Burnside Bridge as they headed toward Old Town. Hundreds of people took to the streets in Atlanta Friday night to protest President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory, CBS affiliate WGCL reports.\u00a0 Police officers have allowed the protesters to march, simply following behind to make sure they remain peaceful. Protesters tried to get on the interstate, but authorities have prevented that from happening. Protesters could be heard shouting a lot of anti-Donald Trump messages, including, \u201cNot My President.\u201d Evening marches disrupted traffic in Miami while organizers said people gathered on Boston Common in what was billed as a rally for peace and love.\u00a0 Earlier, hundreds of people attended another \u201clove rally\u201d in Washington Square Park in Manhattan.  Leslie Holmes, 65, a website developer from Wilton, Connecticut, took an hour-long train ride to the demonstration - her first protest since the 1970s, when she hit the streets of San Francisco to oppose the Vietnam War.  She described herself as an armchair liberal but declared, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be armchair anymore.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a country where my friends aren\u2019t included, and my friends are fearful, and my children are going to grow up in a world that\u2019s frightening, and my granddaughters can look forward to being excluded from jobs and politics and fulfilling their potential, so I\u2019m here for them,\u201d she said.  More than 200 people, carrying signs gathered on the steps of the Washington state Capitol. The group chanted \u201cnot my president\u201d and \u201cno Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\u201d  In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic. A protest also occurred in Minneapolis.\u00a0 More than 100 protesters in Kansas City, Missouri, are decrying president-elect Donald Trump.  As temperatures dipped into the 40s, the demonstrators gathered Friday night outside Kansas City\u2019s landmark Union Station and planned to march to City Hall in the latest protest over Republican mogul\u2019s victory.  Clutching a placard reading \u201cNot My President,\u201d 67-year-old Kansas high school teacher David Young says he objects to what he perceived to be Trump\u2019s intolerance toward Hispanics and other demographic groups during his campaign.  Young, a French and Spanish instructor from Shawnee, Kansas, says \u201cTrump\u2019s message of hate has to be stopped,\u201d and \u201cit goes against everything we\u2019re trying to teach.\u201d  Previous demonstrations since Tuesday\u2019s election drew thousands in New York, Los Angeles and other large urban centers. Some involved sporadic vandalism, violence and street-blocking.\u00a0 In Chicago, multiple groups planned protests through Saturday.  Nadia Gavino, 25, learned about the rallies on Twitter and protested Thursday evening. Gavino, whose father is from Peru and whose mother is of Mexican and Lithuanian heritage, said she took Trump\u2019s harshest statements about immigrants and Latinos personally.  \u201cI obviously agree that he\u2019s racist, he\u2019s sexist, he\u2019s phobic, he\u2019s misogynistic. He\u2019s all these things you don\u2019t want in a leader,\u201d she said.  Ashley Lynne Nagel, 27, said she joined a Thursday night demonstration in Denver.  \u201cI have a leader I fear for the first time in my life,\u201d said Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Hillary Clinton.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re sore losers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation.\u201d  Demonstrations also were planned Saturday in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other areas.  Protesters gathered at Miami\u2019s Bayfront Park Friday night in a demonstration, CBS Miami reports.\u00a0 Several hundred people showed up with signs, voicing their disagreement over Trump\u2019s stunning victory. Police followed along, making sure to keep the peace and prevent drivers on the road from clashing with the crowd. The protest marked dozens of others across the country, including students at the University of Miami who also gathered to hold a demonstration earlier in the day. Video from Chopper 4 showed a largely peaceful protest. Students told CBS Miami they felt their message was more effectively delivered by being peaceful. \u201cI definitely think this is the approach to go,\u201d said Miguel Hernandez. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to fight fire with fire, hate with hate, so the approach we\u2019re taking is fighting hate with love and I think that\u2019s the best thing to do just to show that everyone is accepted and just to show that love can really go a long way, a very far way.\u201d Miami\u2019s protest is expected to last until 10 p.m., according to a post on social media. A group of about 250 students from Minneapolis\u2019 South High School peacefully made their way from South High School to downtown Friday afternoon. They ultimately gathered in a park near U.S. Bank Stadium at around 3:30 p.m., CBS Minnesota reports. About a half an hour later, the group started marching south on Portland Avenue. After heading west on 9th Street, protesters turned to Nicollet Mall where they entered the U.S. Bankcorp Center. The group continued marching downtown and headed into the U.S. Bank Plaza, across from the Hennepin County Government Center. Upset protesters were met with police in cities across the country. Officers in Portland, Oregon confronted thousands of protesters in what police called a \u201criot\u201d and arrested more than two dozen people. Police in riot gear fired rubber bullets to try and break up the crowd. They declared it a riot after people began vandalizing cars and businesses. Some protesters launched fireworks at the police. On Thursday, police in Portland officially declared the protests as \u201criots,\u201d citing \u201cextensive criminal and dangerous behavior.\u201d CBS affiliate KOIN estimated there were around 4,000 protesters Thursday.\u00a0 In New York on Wednesday, an estimated 7,000 people protested in front of Trump\u2019s home at Trump Tower.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s not often that the political and fashion worlds collide, but one designer brought the two industries into the same realm on Thursday afternoon. French designer Sophie Theallet, who has dressed First Lady Michelle Obama, tweeted an open letter explaining why she\u2019ll stay away from Melania Trump once she moves into the White House. \u201cAs an independent fashion brand, we consider our voice an expression of our artistic and philosophical ideas. The Sophie Theallet brand stands against all discrimination and prejudice,\u201d the letter says. Open letter | Sophie Theallet | November 17th, 2016 pic.twitter.com/g1hIAyBmdF Theallet, an immigrant, admits she is \u201cwell aware it is not wise to get involved in politics,\u201d but that the bottom line of her business is \u201cnot just about money\u201d and she must stand by her values. Those values, she writes, do not align with \u201cthe rhetoric of racism, sexism, and xenophobia unleashed by [Donald Trump\u2019s] presidential campaign.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI   will not participate in dressing or associating in any way with the next first lady,\u201d Theallet says. \u201cI encourage my fellow designers to do the same.\u201d Designing for the first lady is a high honor in the fashion world, making Theallet\u2019s appeal to her colleagues even more daring. But she is not the first designer to take a stand against the Trumps. Kaelen Haworth, known for her creations for Blake Lively and Elizabeth Banks, announced after the election that proceeds from items sold on her website would be donated to organizations opposed by Trump. The list includes Planned Parenthood, Black Lives Matter, and Everytown for Gun Safety. But not everyone is jumping off of the Trump Train, and those who have might buy another ticket soon, says fashion legend Carolina Herrera. \u201cI think that in two or three months they\u2019ll reach out, because it\u2019s fashion. You\u2019ll see everyone dressing Melania. She\u2019s representing the United States,\u201d Herrera told Business of Fashion. Cydney Adams is a senior manager of social media for CBS News.
