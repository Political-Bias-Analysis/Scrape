            "article_content": "Are Democrats about to hand the GOP another 1968? Viewed in the abstract, the year of the anti-Vietnam-War protests, the assassinations of leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and the \"Summer of Love\" should have been an electoral layup for the Left. Instead, in the 1968 presidential election Americans handed the White House to one of the Left's most hated enemies, Richard Nixon. Why? Not because the Vietnam War was popular, or Americans were experiencing a conservative revolution (that wouldn't happen until Reagan in 1980). And it certainly wasn't Nixon's charm and charisma. Liberals, who owned the issues of the day, lost at the ballot box because they pushed too far. To paraphrase Barry Goldwater, extremism in defense of liberalism is no way to win elections. Today is not 1968\u2014thankfully.\u00a0 Cities aren't on fire, leaders aren't being assassinated and political violence is largely limited to fiery social-media rhetoric. (Though with some disturbing exceptions). But Democrats are in danger of pushing themselves out of the political mainstream on the eve of a midterm election that, for all sorts of historic reasons, should be an easy win. In just the past week, Democrats have staked out progressive positions that would have been beyond the political pale just a few months ago.\u00a0 When 28-year-old unknown Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated longtime incumbent Joe Crowley, for example, she loudly embraced the #AbolishICE movement\u2014a political meme sprung from the pages of the far-Left Nation magazine.\u00a0 After Ocasio-Cortez's shocking upset, Nancy Pelosi dismissed the suggestion that her race was a sign of her party's leftward movement. \"Our party is a big tent,\" Pelosi said. \"Our districts are very different one from the other.\"\u00a0 But just days later, prominent Democrats like Massachusetts Senator (and potential presidential candidate) Elizabeth Warren, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had taken up the call\u2014a call for what sounds to most Americans like \"open borders\" or \"no enforcement at all,\" no matter how much Democrats talk about their plans for a commission to study enforcement issues. As former Democratic pollster Mark Penn told The Hill, most Americans don't agree. In fact, 84 percent of Americans favor handing undocumented immigrants over to federal agents, he reports. And a new Harvard/Harris poll also found that 69 percent of Americans\u2014and 59 percent of Democrats\u2014oppose disbanding America's immigration law enforcement agency. Republicans who shrug off the passionate opposition inspired by the scene of sobbing mothers at the southern border are no doubt making a mistake. President Trump realizes that, which is why he's backed so far away from the policy so quickly. But Trump, who has displayed an almost visceral understanding of how Middle America feels about issues of the day, also sees the assault on ICE as a self-inflicted wound for Democrats. \"Well I hope they keep thinking about [abolishing ICE]. Because they're going to get beaten so badly,\" Trump said on Fox News. \"I love that issue if they're going to actually do that,\" he added. This isn't good news for Democrats in Indiana or Missouri, who'll be forced to explain their party's support for abolishing ICE in a nation where Americans oppose increased legal immigration by a 2-1 margin. Although that percentage has been dropping, for now, the problem red-state senators have is that's exactly what their base wants to hear. There's something else the base wants to hear: Anger. On the Supreme Court nomination, liberal activists want a fight to the death. As the New York Times reports, \"They want their senators to do nothing less than lie down on the tracks to stop Mr. Trump's nomination.\" It's not extremism in policy but extremism in practice. Some liberal academics are urging Democrats to pack the Supreme Court\u2014add seats to give a future Democratic president a majority of total appointments.\u00a0 As Ian Samuel of Harvard Law put it:\u00a0 \"Pack the courts as soon as we get the chance. 'Pack the courts' should be a phrase on par with \"abolish ICE.\" Calls for court-packing are the \"nuclear option\" on steroids, and no Democrat in Congress has embraced Samuel's call for court-packing yet, but it's not hard to imagine it could be in the Democratic mainstream by the midterms. And then there's the issue of simple civility. Americans are fundamentally nice. They don't like boorish behavior from their president or their co-workers or anyone else. And they're unlikely to respond well to scenes of liberal activists showing up at the homes of office holders like Ajit Pai of the Federal Communications Commission or White House staffer Stephen Miller. Or, as infamously occurred at the Red Hen restaurant in Virginia, refusing to serve White House press secretary Sarah Sanders based on her\u00a0 politics. Most Americans don't want politics to protrude so deeply into our personal lives.\u00a0 Unfortunately for Democrats, nearly half of their voters do.\u00a0 A new poll finds that 49 percent of Democrats supported the restaurant owner who refused to serve Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\u00a0 More than 80 percent of Republicans and 53 percent of independents disagreed. When a sitting members of Congress, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, publicly\u00a0calls for her supporters to \"harass\" members of the government they see \"in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station,\" it gets cheers from the hardcore base. But for swing voters, shouting at people just trying to eat dinner or get gas is not the style of politics they support. In the end, how Democrats campaign may not matter. History is on their side in this midterm election, and if this November turns into a \"base vs. base\" election with low turnout from swing/moderate voters, having an angry, energized party could be an electoral winner. However, it is also possible that all the passion and confrontation could scare voters\u2014particularly older voters, who tend to turn out disproportionately for midterm elections\u2014into opposing what they see as a disturbing level of extremism. If Democrats underperform in November, the culprit could be their over-exuberance today.\u00a0 CBSN contributor Michael Graham is a conservative columnist for the Boston Herald.",

            "article_content": "President Trump focused on immigration Friday in Mesa, Ariz., in his second rally in three consecutive days. Mr. Trump was campaigning for Rep. Martha McSally, who is locked in a challenging race with Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema to fill retiring Sen. Jeff Flake's Senate seat.   Mr. Trump spent much of the rally talking about undocumented immigrants, resurrecting the phrase \"bad hombres\" to describe criminals entering the country illegally. He said hospitals and schools were \"overrun\" with immigrants. \"The casualties in the Democrats' open border crusades are American families,\" Mr. Trump said, incorrectly saying that the Democratic Party supports drugs and criminals pouring into the country. He said that a Democratic victory in November would be a \"bright flashing sign\" to allow drug dealers and criminals to come into the country. Arizonans have also faced a barrage of negative ads by both candidates throughout the election cycle. Sinema has also raised nearly $4 million more than McSally. Although Mr. Trump won Arizona in 2016 by nearly four points, Democrats are hopeful that they can capture Flake's seat, if younger, urban and Hispanic voters turn out in November. The CBS News Battleground Tracker rates the race as \"Edge Democrat.\" Mr. Trump continued his attacks on Democrats, whom he called an \"unhinged mob.\" \"Vote for the jobs, not for the mobs,\" he said, adding that the Republican majority was \"very fragile.\" He urged rally goers not to be \"complacent.\" He also targeted some Democrats by name, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who recently released a DNA test proving that she has a Native American ancestor in response to attacks from Mr. Trump. \"We can no longer call her Pocahontas! I don't know what I'm going to do,\" Mr. Trump said of Warren, claiming the test showed that she had no \"Indian blood.\" The race in Arizona has become increasingly contentious, with McSally accusing Sinema of \"treason\" at a debate earlier this week. Sinema has drawn fire for comments made during a radio interview in 2003, when she told the radio host to \"go ahead\" if he wanted to hypothetically join the Taliban. Mr. Trump also criticized Sinema for those comments. He brought McSally to the stage at one point, where she continued her attacks on Sinema. She promised to fulfill Trump campaign promises, notably building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. \"Martha's opponent is a far-left extremist,\" Mr. Trump said about Sinema, adding that she was being \"protected by the fake news media.\" \"A vote for Kysten Sinema is a wasted vote, but more importantly it's a dangerous vote,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that voting for McSally would be the \"second greatest vote you ever cast.\" \"The first greatest vote was for me,\" he said. Mr. Trump visited Montana Thursday evening to rally for Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale. Mr. Trump focused heavily on illegal immigration in his speech, and will likely do so at Friday's rally as well, given Arizona's proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border. \"This will be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to a\u00a0caravan of migrants\u00a0from Honduras on their way to the American border. \"As you know, I'm willing to send the military to protect our southern border if necessary.\" He also said at one point that \"Democrats produce mobs, Republicans produce jobs.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "MESA, Ariz. -- President Trump is using the migrant caravan as a weapon to bash the Democrats. \"We are about law and order and borders and jobs and they are about allowing crime to enter our country with open borders,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. He even blamed the Democrats for the caravan \u2014 while offering no evidence.\u00a0 \"People are saying there's a lot of money being passed around so that this would normally hit just before an election,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But I happen to think it's a great issue for the Republicans \u2014 this is a great Republican issue.\" Stoking fears about the caravan is the president's latest effort to rally his base just two and a half weeks before the congressional midterm elections.\u00a0 On Thursday night in Montana, Mr. Trump said it would \"be an election on Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense. That's what it's going to be.\" A recent CBS news poll found that\u00a0 Democrats are on track to win 226 seats in the House \u2014 more than the 218 needed for a majority.\u00a0 And while immigration was a key issue in the president's 2016 victory, a CBS News poll out Friday says his approval rating on immigration is just 39 percent\u2014 the lowest on any issue. \u00a0 In Mesa, Arizona Friday evening, hundreds of the president's fans, including Sue Black and her dog Lily, lined up in the hot sun to hear him speak. Black said she thought Mr. Trump was talking about the caravan to get people to the polls.\u00a0 \"We gotta stop them before they get here,\" she said about the caravan. \"We can't even take care of our own people.\" The president appears to agree, promising to deploy the military if the caravan makes it to the U.S. border. \"And we're gonna have the military stationed,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're not coming into this country. They might as well turn back.\" Chip Reid is CBS News' national correspondent.",

            "article_content": "President Trump is pushing the benefits of the GOP tax overhaul at a roundtable with business leaders in Cleveland Saturday, as Republicans attempt to use the law to catapult their way to victory in the midterms this fall. But staying on-message may prove a challenge for the White House. \"Remember, you have to win the great state of Ohio. And did we win the great state of Ohio,\" Trump said to open up the event, referencing his election win.\u00a0 Mr. Trump didn't start out talking about tax reform \u2014 he spoke of what he described as unfair trade policies, and unacceptable illegal immigration. The president said it may be necessary to \"close the country\" until a border wall is built.\u00a0 \"Our borders are and our laws are a mess,\" the president said. Our immigration laws are a disgrace. And Mexico has very some of the toughest immigration laws in the world. You can't just go into Mexico \u2014 but they allow these people to come up through Mexico and into our country.\" The president described his frustration with how Mexico handled a \"caravan\" of migrants from Central American. Mr. Trump said Democrats \"want open borders.\" \"If you don't have borders, you don't have a country,\" he said. But the president did touch on the tax law \u2014 the \"biggest\" in U.S. history, he said, a claim he has continued to make, despite it being proven incorrect. Mr. Trump described how he wanted to call the bill the tax \"cut, cut, cut, cut\" act, but other Republicans found it too \"hokey.\" He invited guests on stage with him to share how the tax bill has increased their paychecks. Sherry Sheely, the COO of her family's furniture retail and appliance store, said the tax bill enabled her business to give unexpected $500 bonuses to their staff. \"We had several employees who got so emotional, they cried,\" she said. Young father \u00a0Chris Jaramillo said he and his wife were able to start a college savings account for their 1-year-old son with the $500 he received from a bonus from his company, and place him in a better daycare with the $125 more he is seeing in his paychecks because of the tax law. Rep. Jim Renacci, the Republican running in an attempt to take Ohio Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown's seat in November, said at the event that the tax cuts are \"working.\"\u00a0 The president said Renacci is looking good ahead of the election \u2014 \"Go out and help Jim, we'll get it done,\" Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump's visit to Cleveland is a part of the broader GOP attempt to use December's tax reform to bolster their chances in what will be a tough midterm election cycle. But the bill's popularity isn't certain. A March 2018 Gallup poll found the bill had been gaining in popularity, but still had higher disapproval -- 48 percent -- than approval, at 39 percent. Staying on message, however, can sometimes be a challenge for the White House. On Friday, Mr. Trump was in a talkative mood en route to Dallas, where he addressed the National Rifle Association. He stopped to talk to reporters at the White House, Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and on Air Force One. As the White House looked to stay on message about pressing issues securing the nomination of Gina Haspel, nominated to run the CIA, and a positive jobs report, Mr. Trump offered his opinions on his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as well as Stormy Daniels\u00a0and the Russia investigation. Giuliani told Fox News' Sean Hannity Mr. Trump \"reimbursed\" his longtime attorney Michael Cohen for Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, ahead of the 2016 election. Mr. Trump seemed to confirm that repayment in tweets Thursday, before claiming on Friday Giuliani didn't know the full situation and will \"get his facts straight.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump's appearance in Cleveland also comes after the president announced Friday a date and location have been set for his meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, although Mr. Trump didn't share the details.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Georgia Republicans decide a bruising gubernatorial runoff Tuesday that is testing the loyalty of conservative voters to President Donald Trump and their frequent rejection of the establishment in favor of outside, bare-knuckled politics. The matchup between Secretary of State Brian Kemp and Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle pits the White House, which backs Kemp, against outgoing Republican Gov. Nathan Deal, who backs Cagle. Democrat Stacey Abrams awaits the winner in the fall, seeking to become the first black female governor of any American state. A well-known figure at the Georgia Capitol, Cagle entered the Republican race as the presumed front-runner, with financial backing from much of the state's lobbying class. Even as a statewide elected official, Kemp positioned himself as a \"politically incorrect conservative\" outsider perpetually battling liberal Democrats and Republican insiders. Both Republicans have tried to align themselves with Trump, while taking hard lines on immigration, guns and social issues. But Cagle is widely viewed as the more moderate choice and the candidate most likely to tack back to the center in a general election campaign. The question is whether that's a liability that prevents him from getting past Republican primary voters that Kemp courted with ads featuring guns, chainsaws and a pickup truck to \"round up criminal illegals.\" Cagle led the initial five-man primary in May, but fell well shy of the majority required to avoid a runoff. The two months since have been a cascade of problems for the veteran politician, and public polls suggest Kemp has closed the gap. The lieutenant governor unwittingly played into Kemp's framing when he was secretly recorded earlier this year by a former rival who captured Cagle explaining in detail that he steered legislation in the state Senate based on campaign contributions. Another clip among several released during the runoff campaign revealed Cagle describing the GOP contest as a race to be \"the craziest\" candidate with \"the biggest gun\" and \"the biggest truck.\" Trump's unexpected endorsement of Kemp last week, followed by a weekend visit from Vice President Mike Pence, threw the race into overdrive. \"Brian is tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration. He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment. I give him my full and total endorsement,\" Trump tweeted. It was an unexpected venture into a governor's race for a president whose midterm electoral efforts have been focused mostly on defending GOP majorities on Capitol Hill and on his own re-election campaign rallies. It's a matter of risk-and-reward for Georgia Republicans and Trump, who was burned last year when he twice backed losing Senate candidates in neighboring Alabama. Kemp offers Trump a chance to back another brash politician who can carry the president's brand in a state the president won in 2016. But that alliance also alarms some GOP players wary about Georgia's changing electorate and a national mood that favors Democrats \u2014 potentially giving Democrats an opening in a state the GOP has dominated at the polls for the last two decades. Those concerns became evident days before Trump waded into the race, when Deal, a broadly popular figure, weighed in with his own 11th hour endorsement for Cagle. Deal touted Cagle as an able business recruiting partner and his best potential successor, but the move stood out for a governor who'd previously been content to leave party faithful to their own choices. In Georgia, the governor and lieutenant governor are elected independently, meaning Cagle was never elected as part of a ticket with Deal, though the pair hail from the same north Georgia town of Gainesville. The National Rifle Association also threw its weight behind Cagle in April after he helped kill a tax break that would have saved Delta Air Lines, one of the state's largest employers, millions per year for ending a discount program for NRA members. Cagle was joined on the campaign trail by the president-elect of the gun-rights group, Oliver North, for stops in Savannah, Kennesaw and Gainesville. Polls are open Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. across the state. Early in-person voting began July 2.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 The sequel to President Donald Trump's first year in office is opening with the lead player hamstrung by a government shutdown and hunkering down amid investigations, crises and political unease. After 365 days in the Oval Office, Trump has found that his drive to deliver quickly on campaign promises has yielded to the sobering reality of governing \u2014 and the prospect of an electoral rebuke in November. Administration aides, outside allies and Republicans on Capitol Hill see the Trump White House continuing to face many of the same challenges it wrestled with last year, with fresh plot twists to boot. Special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election keeps moving ever closer to the Oval Office. The government shutdown highlights the legislative challenges that persist even with Republicans controlling the White House and both the House and Senate, and makes clear the administration's need to more carefully target its political capital on specific agenda items. And the fall elections are shaping up as a referendum on Trump's tenure. \"In the second year, you no longer are one-dimensional,\" said Ari Fleischer, press secretary when George W. Bush was president. \"There's an inevitable pivot that every administration makes, and that is to recognize that it's no longer about future events and promises, it's now about defending and promoting last year's accomplishments.\" No administration comes into office fully ready for the task of leading the government, and Trump's team has taken disruption to a new extreme. Republicans outside the White House are now hoping the Trump administration will be more politically savvy. But the 71-year old president has proved set in his ways, trusting his instincts over the advice of his aides, and there is no reason to expect that won't continue. Yet Trump has been changed by the experiences of the past year, according to aides and outside advisers, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal dynamics. The president has grown more fearful of leaks. His inner circle of friends is smaller, most recently with the banishment of former chief strategist Steve Bannon. This smaller group of informal advisers has seen Trump favor those who tell him what he likes to hear, according to several people who talk to him regularly. And that, combined with chief of staff John Kelly's determination not to manage the president, is furthering the Trump's impulsive streak. What comes next? Personnel changes are afoot to streamline the West Wing political and legislative affairs teams in preparation for the November elections, and Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are preparing aggressive campaign and fundraising schedules. Despite a booming economy, Trump's approval rating is at historic lows for a first-year president, weighed down by partisan controversy and his own divisive actions and statements. The fall contests represent a make-or-break moment for Trump and could influence his pursuit of a second term, an effort that will begin in earnest next year. GOP lawmakers frame the importance of keeping control of the House and Senate in self-serving terms for Trump: Democratic control would grant subpoena power to the president's fiercest critics. Wary of potentially losing the Senate, the White House plans to continue its aggressive push to appoint conservative judges before Congress breaks for campaign season. For all the legislative ambition of the first year, Trump's second stands to be a more muted affair. Immigration, the sticking point in the current shutdown, stands as the most promising option after the president provoked a crisis by setting up the March 5 expiration of protections for roughly 700,000 young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children. He's hoping to use it as leverage to pass his hard-line immigration priorities. Before the State of the Union address Jan. 30, the White House has been preparing much-delayed policy proposals on infrastructure and welfare, but little progress is anticipated as lawmakers have begun turning their focus to their own re-elections. White House officials said Trump is looking forward to spending much of the year promoting his achievements on judicial nominations, deregulation and passage of the tax overhaul. \"If year one is about tallying campaign promises,\" said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley, \"in year two, we can talk about results.\" Administration officials pointed to Trump's speech Thursday in Pennsylvania, where he highlighted the benefits of his tax plan, as an example of his efforts to sell his first year to the public. Overseas, many of the same challenges remain. The nuclear threat from North Korea occupies an ever-growing focus inside the West Wing. And while the Islamic State group's foothold in Iraq and Syria has been diminished, Trump is facing new questions about the role of U.S. troops in the region.",

            "article_content": "A growing list of corporate contributors to Rep. Steve King say they'll no longer donate money to the Iowa Republican, who is facing intensifying scrutiny for his controversial statements on race and his links with white nationalists. Purina Petcare, part of Swiss-based food conglomerate Nestl\u00e9 S.A., this week followed Land O'Lakes and Intel in vowing to end campaign contributions to King, an eight-term congressman up for reelection on Nov. 6. The pet-food giant, which donated $500 to King's campaign in September, responded to questions about its support by saying the lawmaker's \"recent statements\" conflicted with its values. Like privately owned dairy company Land O'Lakes, the decision came amid online calls for boycotts\u00a0of Purina's products. Our PAC contributions are typically made to elected officials from both parties who represent the local communities where we have operations and associates.  Representative King\u2019s recent statements are in conflict with our values and we are no longer contributing to his campaign. King, who has a long history of inflammatory rhetoric, has stirred controversy by refusing to delete a\u00a0retweet\u00a0of the British immigration activist and Nazi sympathizer Mark Collett and by displaying a\u00a0confederate flag\u00a0on his desk in Washington, D.C. The firebrand lawmaker in September also\u00a0endorsed\u00a0a candidate for mayor of Toronto who has espoused white supremacist views.\u00a0 \"The Land O'Lakes Inc.

On that basis, we have determined that our PAC will no longer support Rep. Steve King moving forward.\" A spokesperson for King referred CBS MoneyWatch to the congressman's Twitter account, in which the congressman blamed the news media for the negative publicity. Another company that has backed King, AT&T, now faces online\u00a0calls\u00a0to boycott the telecommunications giant and an appeal from two Jewish leaders from King's home state.\u00a0 \"We call on King's donors to cut off their financial support.

A spokesperson for AT&T, which contributed $5,000 to King's campaign at the\u00a0end\u00a0of September, said it doesn't intend to make any further donations given the culmination of the current political cycle with next week's midterm election. \"Our PAC contributions are managed and approved by a committee of employees who represent various levels and business units throughout the company,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"When the PAC committee meets next year to decide future contributions for 2019 and beyond, they will take all concerns very seriously.\" King Response pic.twitter.com/H8iXI3cM1x Steve King represents all that is worst in the GOP. Good for Land O'Lakes for finally withdrawing its support from his campaign for re-election. https://t.co/zovTJuAGmz Land O'Lakes is a Fortune 500 company that operates as a member-owned food and agricultural cooperative and reported revenue of $13.7 billion last year. Its corporate PAC gave $2,500 to King's campaign in June,\u00a0according\u00a0to Federal Election Commission records.That donation was condemned by liberals including former presidential candidate Howard Dean and TV host Soledad O'Brien, who called the the company's donation to King \"appalling.\" This is appalling: \u201cFor his 2018 campaign, King has received contributions from AT&T ($5,000), Berkshire Hathaway ($2,500), the American Bankers Association ($9,000), Land O\u2019Lakes ($2,500), Intel ($2,000), and many others.\u201d https://t.co/aB6JywWOSC \"Land O Lakes dairy company sent this guy money.

A political newsletter, Popular Information, reported on Sunday that Intel stated in an internal email to employees that it would no longer contribute to King's campaigns after reviewing his public statements and determining they conflicted with the company's values. The newsletter quoted an Oct. 25 email from Dawn Jones, Intel's director of policy and external partnerships: \"We had engaged with Rep. King because of his support for IP theft protections, which is important to Intel's business. However, an Intel employee raised concerns about the donations earlier this month. We looked into the congressman's public statements and determined that they conflict with Intel values. As a result, we are no longer donating to his campaigns.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "An attorney who has bedeviled President Donald Trump during the past year over his personal relationships and immigration policies made a presidential pitch of his own to Democratic voters in New Hampshire on Sunday. Michael Avenatti, who represents adult film actress Stormy Daniels in her case against Trump, told the Hillsborough County Democrats that he was considering matching Trump's confrontational style with his own pugilistic brand in a 2020 presidential run. \"When they go low, we hit harder,\" Avenatti said, modifying a former first lady Michelle Obama slogan. Avenatti acknowledged that some of the roughly 200 voters at the outdoor barbecue might be thinking, \"What is some porn lawyer doing here today?\" But, he added, \"As you all know, these are anything but usual times.\" Democrats today, he said, are fighting for \"nothing short of the survival of our republic.\" Tracing his background, Avenatti said he had grown up in Missouri without a \"golden toilet\" \u2014 an allusion to the Trump family's wealth \u2014 and was the first in his family to graduate from college. Attorney Michael Avenatti spoke to voters in New Hampshire on Sunday. Avenatti, who represents Stormy Daniels, says he is considering running for President and taking on Donald Trump in 2020. (Aug. 20) As a trial lawyer, he said, he represented \"Davids\" against \"Goliaths\" \u2014 and still does now, he said, with his advocacy for Daniels, who says she was coerced into staying silent about her alleged relationship with Trump, and for immigrant families separated by the White House's crackdown on asylum seekers at the border. Avenatti has put a toe in the 2020 race, posting a platform on Twitter and recently visiting Iowa, another key primary state that he will soon visit again. On Sunday, he said he was still seriously considering whether to run. But \"what I fear most . is that (Democrats) have a tendency to bring nail clippers to a gunfight,\" said. Avenatti, who has gained notoriety for assailing Trump using the president's favored medium, Twitter. Speaking to reporters later, Avenatti addressed some Democrats' concerns about adopting Trump's tactics, arguing that a successful challenger must be able to counter the president's provocations. He praised Hillary Clinton's resume and character, but noted that she lost the 2016 election despite being the most qualified candidate \"in U.S. history.\" Avenatti was not the only politician at Sunday's gathering to use Trump as a motivator for voters. Democratic candidates from county commissioner up to governor sought to tie local Republicans to the president. Steve Marchand, a former mayor of Portsmouth running for governor, said the Republican incumbent, Chris Sununu, was linked to Trump \"by complicity\" with his policies on immigration, voter rights and education. Molly Kelly, a former state senator also competing in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, tied Sununu to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos through their support for an educational voucher system, which Kelly said \"weakens public education and . will raise property taxes.\" Voters on hand appeared cautiously taken with Avenatti, who received a celebrity reception after arriving Sunday afternoon, stopping every few feet for a selfie photo as he slowly made his way through an energized crowd. Kathy Boyer, a former law firm clerk from Amherst, said she liked Avenatti's message and hoped he would prove a viable candidate, despite never having held political office. \"People said the same thing about Donald Trump,\" she said. \"Look what happened.\"",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, that aired Sunday, June 24, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Ohio Republican Congressman Jim Jordan. He is a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. He's just outside Columbus this morning. Congressman, thank you for joining us. REP. JIM JORDAN: You bet. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. How should Americans view those fleeing across the border? Should they view them as victims or as criminals? REP. JORDAN: I think we should- America is the most welcoming country on the planet. But you got to- you've got to follow the law. Secretary Nielsen has been real clear, you show up to open a port of entry. Your family will be kept together. You will go through the process and we'll see if you're actually a legitimate asylum seeker. What I do know is, when ICE was in our office just a week and a half ago they told me 80 percent of the folks seeking asylum wind up not getting it they're not actually eligible for it. So we want to sort that all out do it in a way that consistent with the law--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\u00a0REP. JORDAN: --but what we most want-\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration also has narrowed the definition for claiming asylum as while you can no longer claim you're a victim of violence.\u00a0REP. JORDAN: 80 percent 80- per-. This is straight from the folks at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. So they're telling me the number, 80 percent aren't actual legitimate asylum seekers. We need to sort that out. But yeah we want to welcome folks who come here for legitimate reasons who want to- who do it by the rule of law. Who follow the law. We want to welcome them here, but mostly what we want to do, Margaret, is the mandate from the 2016 election was real clear the American people made Donald Trump president made Republicans the majority in the House and the Senate to build a border security wall, stop chain migration, end the sanctuary city policy, reform our asylum laws, get rid of the visa lottery and then also deal with the DACA population. That legislation which was consistent with that mandate and the promise we made to the American people was on the floor just three days ago and fell a few votes short of passing. Got 193 votes. That's the focus that we should be-\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well it failed.\u00a0REP. JORDAN: That should be our focus and that should be the legislation should be--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It failed and the president now says this compromise bill is kind of a waste of time. What are you going to vote on that?\u00a0REP. JORDAN: Well the compromise bill was pulled because it was going to get a lot less votes. If our leadership had whipped, had put the same whip effort behind that immigration legislation, Chairman Goodatte's legislation, it would have passed.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you--\u00a0REP. JORDAN: It was that close to passing.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know something we don't? How that-\u00a0REP. JORDAN: Let's focus on that\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: vote on the compromise bill been canceled?\u00a0REP. JORDAN: It hasn't been canceled but the reason it was- it wasn't it was supposed to happen Thursday night.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REP. JORDAN: Then it was supposed to happen Friday and it still hasn't happened.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REP. JORDAN: And the reason it hasn't happened because it would have got a lot less votes than the conservative bill, the one that is consistent with the mandate of the election. Consistent with what we told the American people we would do if they put us in office that bill got 193 votes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REP. JORDAN: It was just 19 votes short of passing on last Thursday.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to that question of a narrow issue that Senator Corker was talking about, simply allowing families to be detained together\u00a0REP. JORDAN: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: and getting rid of this 20 day limit that's affected the separation policy. Would you support something like that in the House?\u00a0REP. JORDAN: We're all opposed-\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: like is being proposed in the Senate?\u00a0REP. JORDAN: Yeah but Chuck Schumer is the problem. My- my colleague Mark Meadows has a bill that would address the situation keep families together but do it in a way where we can actually find out and follow the rule of law. Senator Cruz has a bill. But Chuck Schumer says no, no, no, we're not going to bring it up because the Democrats really deep down what they care about is catch and release what they want is open borders and what they want is the political issue. They don't want to solve the problems they don't want to keep families together and adjudicate this and have a go through the hearing process and do it in a way that's consistent with the rule of law. They don't want to do that. Chuck Schumer was clearly held up the pin and said we're not going to we're not going to support Mr. Meadows legislation or Senator Cruz's legislation. So yeah I'm- I'm for fixing that. My good friend--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think the administration has handled this--\u00a0REP. JORDAN: --Mark Meadows introduced the bill.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think this- the administration's handled this family separation issue well? Should there be an investigation into how this was carried out?\u00a0REP. JORDAN: The president has issued his executive order. The problem is the 20 day--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a temporary fix, as you just said\u00a0REP. JORDAN: The- the problem is the 20 day rule.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REP. JORDAN: The Flores decision and now that is in conflict with keeping families together for a longer period of time because the rule says you have to. You can only detain children for 20 days. We want to do that in a way that keeps the families together. So we-we have legislation to address that. But again as I said Senator Schumer doesn't want to support any legislation to fix the problem.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well- I want to- There's so much more we can talk about on this topic but I want to ask you about one of the committees you're on and a deposition this week- or some testimony this week from\u00a0REP. JORDAN: Peter Strzok yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: FBI agent-. Exactly Peter Struck. Who, for our viewers, was removed from the special counsel investigation for some disparaging text messages he had sent about the president.\u00a0REP. JORDAN: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you want to know from him?\u00a0REP. JORDAN: Well we're going to have a lot of questions for him but I-I think some of the things are, Who did he talk to in the course of the Russian investigation? because remember a couple of key things Margaret. On July 31, 2016 Peter Strzok opens the Russian investigation. He was the lead agent on the investigation after being of course the lead agent on the Clinton investigation as well. He opens that investigation eight days later. There's the text message that says \"We'll stop Trump\" one week after that on August 15th, is the text message that says \"we have an insurance policy.\" So obviously we'll want to dig into that, we'll want to know who were you talking to at the time? how many times did you travel overseas? Did he talk to key people? For example do you think Peter Strzok may have talked to Glenn Simpson or Christopher Steele? Those are the kind of questions I think need to be asked and I'll look forward to this. Deposition is scheduled for Wednesday of this week.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be watching for that. Congressman thank you.\u00a0REP. JORDAN: You bet. Thank you. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Just one day after cancelling his planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, President Trump appeared on Friday to revive hopes for the historic meeting in Singapore. \"They very much want to do it. We'd like to do it,\" the president told reporters, \"we're going to see what happens.\" North Korean state media had called the pullout \"unexpected,\" coming just hours after, in a confidence-building gesture, American journalists watched the regime demolish tunnels to its nuclear testing site. President Trump blamed his pullout on \"tremendous anger and open hostility\" in a recent statement from North Korea, the latest in weeks of escalating barbs traded between the two countries. The Trump administration and others have also suggested Chinese President Xi Jinping has undermined the talks, encouraging Kim to take a harder line in the negotiations. On Thursday, senior intelligence and law enforcement officials briefed lawmakers on the FBI's use of an informant in investigating Russia's 2016 election meddling. For weeks, President Trump has alleged the FBI spied on his campaign, saying it \"could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!\"  Democrats have derided the allegations as an unfounded attempt to undermine the special counsel's probe. But some House Republicans have called for a second special counsel to investigate the so-called \"Spygate\" charges. The idea gained steam this week after House Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, endorsed the proposal.  Also this week, President Trump slammed Democrats for \"sticking up\" for MS-13 gang members and bemoaned lawmakers' failure to pass immigration reform. The remarks came as factions of House Republicans are fighting with Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, for a vote on a variety of immigration proposals. The warring factions have sparked chaos on Capitol Hill, dooming an unrelated farm bill last week. And the 2018 midterm elections heated up this week as voters headed to the polls in Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, and Texas. The results set the stage for possibly historic wins by female candidates this fall, including a choice in Georgia to elect the country's first female black governor. President Trump is also gearing up to play a key role in defending conservative majorities in Congress, though he seemed unsure of its importance this week. This Sunday, join Margaret Brennan (@margbrennan) for a discussion of the week that was, and the week ahead, on \"Face the Nation\" (@FaceTheNation). We'll hear from Sen. Marco Rubio (@marcorubio), R-Florida, a key vote on the Senate's Foreign Relations committee. We'll talk also to James Clapper, former director of national intelligence and author of \"Facts and Fears: Hard Truths from a Life in Intelligence.\" CBS News Foreign Correspondent Ben Tracy (@benstracy) will join us for a Reporter's Notebook looking back at his week reporting from inside North Korea. Former senior CIA analyst Sue Mi Terry (@SueMiTerry), now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Jean Lee (@newsjean) of the Wilson Center will join us to discuss the latest developments from North Korea.

            "article_content": "MATIAS ROMERO, Mexico -- President Donald Trump's angry comments about a caravan of migrants ricochet around like a soccer ball in the dusty athletic complex in southern Mexico where the 1,000 or so Central Americans have camped since the weekend. Mr. Trump's words have confused and befuddled families here, some of whom never intended on going all the way to the United States after the end of the \"Stations of the Cross\" caravan. It is a symbolic event held around Easter each year to raise awareness about the plight of migrants and has never left southern Mexico, though some participants then continue north on their own. Even coordinators of the caravan seemed to misunderstand the debate in the U.S. when Mr. Trump's endorsed a \"nuclear option\" for pushing funding for his border wall through Congress. They told worried families Tuesday that the U.S. president had floated the idea of using a nuclear weapon against the caravan of mostly women and children who have fled violence in Central America. Sitting on a thin foam pad and trying to corral her sons, 2-year old Jonathan and 6-year-old Omar, Gabriela Hernandez wondered aloud at what Trump must think of them. \"I see it as something really sad, because I don't understand how a child this age can make things difficult for him,\" said Hernandez, a 27-year-old who is two months pregnant. She would like to get into the U.S., where she has a cousin in Houston. Crime in Honduras was so bad that she decided to embark on the difficult a journey across several international borders with two young asthmatic sons, the younger of whom is now sick and on antibiotics. In the minds of Hernandez and many of her fellow travelers, the risks they have taken should be an indication of how unsustainable their circumstances are back home. Hondurans predominate in this year's caravan, but it includes families from Guatemala and El Salvador as well. \"The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our 'Weak Laws' Border, had better be stopped before it gets there,\" Trump tweeted. After hearing that Mr. Trump raised the possibility of sending troops to defend the U.S. border, Irineo Mujica, coordinator of the caravan, gathered the camp's women and children around him and asked which of them Mr. Trump was afraid of. \"All of the women, children come fleeing violence,\" Mujica said. \"These children are not soldiers.\" Late Tuesday, the first migrants began receiving documents from Mexican immigration authorities. Some give them 20 days to transit the country on their way to the U.S. border with the stated goal of applying for asylum. Others got papers in a first step toward a humanitarian Mexican residency visa for especially vulnerable people or a start to the application process for asylum in Mexico. Mayra Zepeda, 38, of Honduras, said that once she gets documents to cross Mexico, she and her husband will continue their journey toward the border city of Tijuana. She said they hope to find better paying jobs there and aren't planning to try to cross into the U.S. The couple left Honduras in December after incumbent President Juan Orlando Hernandez was declared the winner of a contested election. The factory where she made T-shirts for export closed due to the weeks of instability that followed the election, she said. She and her family stopped in the Mexican town of Tapachula at the Guatemala border for three months and she worked in a restaurant. When the caravan came together there they saw it as a good opportunity to make a move with safety in numbers. On Tuesday afternoon, she cooked a cauldron full of sliced squash and eggs over an open fire for the caravan's security team, volunteers who keep an eye on things. \"Honestly, I want to be Mexican,\" Zepeda said. \"We're not going to cross. We're just going to stay here.\" Others were not so fortunate on the first try. Jose Carlos Lanza, traveling with his pregnant wife from Honduras, rushed forward when his name was called Tuesday only to find that they had got one letter wrong in his name, making his permit to travel across Mexico worthless and potentially delaying him for another day. The problem was that someone was already en route to pick him up and take him to the U.S. border. \"I can't wait any longer,\" he said. Earlier Tuesday, Lanza said the U.S. government was ignorant about the migrants' situation. \"They don't see that the majority of the people here are children and women,\" he said. \"I think it's stupid because the only thing we are looking for is safety for our family and it's not fair that they treat us like terrorists.\"",

            "article_content": "With passage of an enormous budget bill, the GOP-controlled Congress all but wrapped up its legislating for the year. But will it be enough to convince voters to give Republicans another term at the helm? In two big ways, Republicans have done what they promised. They passed a long sought tax overhaul bill that slashed tax rates. They've rolled back regulations, in ways they claim are boosting the economy. In the Senate, they confirmed a justice to the Supreme Court. But there are signs Americans wanted more: immigration reforms, gun control legislation, even an infrastructure plan that President Trump promised voters. Tax cuts, for now, will have to do. \"It's very clear that tax reform was going to be the biggest legislative crown jewel of this Congress,\" said Matt Gorman, the spokesman for the House GOP's campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"That is a massive centerpiece of our campaign.\" But polls swing wildly these days, strategists said. Voters are rarely focused for too long on single issues that can make or break campaigns, as when Republicans seized control of the House in 2010 amid the economic downturn or Democrats pushed to the majority in 2006 over opposition to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and congressional ethics scandals. Mr. Trump's mixed messages on the GOP's accomplishments only make the campaigning more difficult. At the White House on Friday, he toyed with a veto of the $1.3 trillion budget package, complaining it lacked his immigration deal and smacked of overspending, before ultimately signing it. Such shifting views leave Republicans without a reliable partner as they try to push through political headwinds in what's expected to be a tough battle for majority control of the House and Senate. Lawmakers left town for a two-week recess that marks the unofficial end of the legislating season having shelved resolution of other issues. Congress failed to pass legislation to curb rising health insurance premiums or protect young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation, two issues that have stirred voters this year. And ahead of the nationwide \"March for Our Lives\" protests against gun violence, lawmakers took modest steps to boost school safety funds and improve compliance with the federal gun purchase background check system. Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said the measures are \"just not enough.\" \"The American people have been screaming from the rooftops for real, bold change to fight against\" tragedies such as the Florida and Las Vegas shootings, Brown said. \"We have seen the consequences of Congress's inaction.\" Congress' spring agenda is thin. It includes modest plans to finish a banking bill that rolls back some of the regulations put in place after the financial crisis and pass a big farm bill that sets agriculture and school nutrition policies. The Senate also has to begin confirmation hearings for Trump's nominees for secretary of state and CIA director. The one legislative lift will be another spending bill when the one Mr. Trump signed into law expires at the end of September. But it may bring more political risk than reward for Republicans, since conservatives largely sided with the president against this one, and could pose a more serious threat of voter revolt in the fall. Strategists say it will be up to candidates to make the case that GOP's signature legislative accomplishment is worth their re-election. Democrats have been hammering on the tax law as a giveaway to big business, in part because the steep reduction in corporate rates, from 35 percent to 21 percent, is permanent while the reduced rates for individuals and other provisions for families, including expanded child tax credits, expire in coming years. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has derided the lopsided benefits for households as \"crumbs\" \u2014 a quip Republicans eagerly throw back at Democrats. To prop up public opinion of the GOP's top accomplishment, millions are being spent by outside groups. American Action Network, which is aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, is unleashing more than $30 million in ads, and the network backed by the influential Koch brothers will spend more than $20 million, heaping praise on lawmakers who voted for the tax cuts and informing voters about those who didn't. And with passage of tax cuts so important to the GOP election effort, Republicans might take the unusual step of trying to pass them again. \"We think there's more we can do,\" Ryan said. House GOP leaders are seriously considering legislation this summer \u2014 \"Tax Cuts 2\" \u2014 that would try to build on the original bill that became law in December by making the individual tax cuts permanent. A do-over tax cuts bill is not expected to pass this Congress. But setting up another showdown accomplishes political goals for Republicans by turning attention back on the tax law, and pushing Democrats into the uncomfortable position of voting against it, again. Americans for Prosperity, one of the groups in the Koch network, launched an ad campaign urging Congress to fortify the law by making tax cuts permanent. \"More needs to be done,\" the group says on a website for its advocacy. \"Even if there are things that get passed between now and the fall, the bottom line is the single most important piece of legislation is going to be the tax bill,\" said veteran strategist David Winston, who advises House and Senate GOP leadership. \"That defines what this Congress is about.\"",

            "article_content": "The House on Thursday passed a GOP-backed short-term spending bill that would fund the government through Feb. 16. The Senate debated the bill, but ultimately voted to adjourn until Friday at 11 a.m., leaving the Senate only one day before the government shuts down.\u00a0 If lawmakers don't extend funding by Friday night, the government will shut down early Saturday. It would be the first government shutdown since 2013.\u00a0 On the Senate floor, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said Republicans and Democrats don't want a shutdown, blaming the situation on the president's shifting opinions and pitting Congress against the president. \"The only person who's ever rooted for a shutdown frankly is our president,\" Schumer said, referencing a presidential tweet from May 2017 in which Mr. Trump suggested the country \"needs a good shutdown.\"\u00a0 Following the 230-197 vote in the House, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan urged Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to not shut down the government. Mr. Trump has said Democrats would be to blame in a shutdown.\u00a0 \"The only people standing in the way of keeping the government open are Senate Democrats,\" Ryan said. This marks the fourth short-term spending bill Congress has had on its plate since September. Democrats, however, remain largely opposed to the measure, known as a continuing resolution (CR), because they want it tied to a larger immigration deal over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and border security.  The CR includes a six-year reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and delays on three Obamacare taxes. Shortly before the vote, the House Freedom Caucus said a majority of its members had voted to approve the measure, making passage more certain.\u00a0 Democrats would be to blame, Ryan said earlier Thursday, if the government winds up shutting down, blasting them for using the military as \"bargaining chips.\" The bill's fate in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to advance the legislation to a final vote, is much more uncertain. Republicans only have 51 members and Democrats now have 49, with the new addition of Sen. Doug Jones, D-Alabama. Schumer said Thursday morning that the House CR would not be acceptable to Senate Democrats. Thursday night, Schumer suggested a much shorter CR \u2014 perhaps four or five days \u2014 to make time to reach a long-term spending agreement. McConnell rejected that idea.\u00a0 The government last shut down in October 2013 for 16 days after Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, led an unsuccessful effort to defund Obamacare. Republicans went on to retake control of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections. It's unclear how a government shutdown would affect either party in this year's midterm elections in November.\u00a0 CBS News' Steven Portnoy and Kathryn Watson contributed to this report.\u00a0 Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended the use of tear gas at the southern border against members of the migrant caravan, saying the clashes were \"entirely predictable.\" She also pushed back against the viral photos of women and children running from the tear gas, and said that \"the caravan members are predominately male.\" \"I refuse to believe that anyone honestly maintains that attacking law enforcement with rocks and projectiles is acceptable,\" she said\u00a0in a statement posted to Facebook. \"It is shocking that I have to explain this, but officers can be seriously or fatally injured in such attacks. Self-defense isn't debatable for most law-abiding Americans.\" Nielsen's statement echoes comments made by President Trump on Monday, when he defended the use of what he called \"safe\" tear gas to stop migrants\u00a0trying to rush into the U.S.\u00a0The U.S. Customs and Border Control commissioner said more than 1,000 migrants tried to storm the border on Sunday; Mexico's government said the number was about 500.\u00a0 \"It appears in some cases that the limited number of women and children in the caravan are being used by the organizers as 'human shields' when they confront law enforcement,\" Nielsen said in her statement. \"They are being put at risk by the caravan organizers as we saw at the Mexico-Guatemala border. This is putting vulnerable people in harms way.\" Images of mothers with young children \u2014 some barefoot, some in diapers \u2014 running from the tear gas has dominated coverage of the clash. The Trump administration has emphasized that those people are the exception and that it the caravan is dominated by men, including, they say, many criminals. Nielsen's defense of the border action comes amid speculation that bubbled up after the midterm elections that\u00a0she is expected to leave by the end of the year. There have been reports that the president has been frustrated by what he views as her lackluster performance on immigration enforcement.\u00a0 In her Facebook statement, Nielsen thanked the president for his decision to move troops to the border to deal with the migrant caravan. \"Instead of 'a political stunt,' as suggested by some, this was in fact the act of a leader concerned about the rule of law,\" she wrote. \"This Administration warned about the danger of the caravan.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 At a ceremony celebrating the Hindu festival of lights Tuesday, President Trump had no comment on reports that he plans to remove Kirstjen Nielsen as secretary of homeland security. Sources familiar with the matter tell CBS News Nielsen will be leaving, but say the timing is uncertain. Just last month, Mr. Trump praised her response to devastating hurricanes, and she has been a vocal advocate for the president's policies, including immigration. But sources say she could fall victim to the president's frustration that his immigration agenda has stalled. Mr. Trump said last week that \"a lot of administrations make changes after midterms.\" If Nielsen is forced out, it could lead to yet another clash between the president and chief of staff John Kelly, who is Nielsen's strongest supporter in the White House. Sources say her firing could result in Kelly's departure. If Kelly were to leave, sources say the president has been advised to bring in someone with more political experience in preparation for the 2020 re-election campaign, like Nick Ayers, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence.  Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway attempted to cast doubt Tuesday on the anonymously sourced reports about a staff shake-up. \"Why do they remain anonymous? Could it be that it's not completely verified and true?\" she said. First lady Melania Trump made her own personnel recommendation, saying she was unhappy with the deputy national security advisor, Mira Ricardel, who traveled with her to Africa last month.  Mr. Trump said Ricardel \u2014 seen Tuesday afternoon standing behind the president \u2014 was involved in disagreements over seating on the plane and other logistics. In a rare public rebuke, the first lady's office said Ricardel \"no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\" \u00a0Mrs. Trump shared these views directly with her husband, but Ricardel is still in her job.

            "article_content": "President Trump took a very public dig at Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan Wednesday, saying the Wisconsin Republican should be \"focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about!\" Mr. Trump jabbed one of the top leaders of his own party after Ryan said Tuesday the president \"cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,\" the clearest objection to the president's proposal from GOP leadership. The latest CBS News polls show Democrats are likely to take control of the House away from Republicans in next week's midterms. The president's own campaign schedule generally veers away from competitive House districts.\u00a0 \"Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about!\" Mr. Trump tweeted Wednesday. \"Our new Republican Majority will work on this, Closing the Immigration Loopholes and Securing our Border!\" Days out from the midterms, however, it is Mr. Trump who has brought birthright citizenship to the forefront of the political conversation. In an interview with Axios that aired Tuesday morning, the president declared he will end the right in the 14th Amendment via executive order, and claims the Constitution does not cover birthright citizenship.\u00a0 Ryan made his remarks on Tuesday in a local radio interview with WVLK in Tennessee. \"Well you obviously cannot do that,\" Ryan said, asked for his position on the president's proposal. \"You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order. We didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws via executive action, and obviously as conservatives we believe in the Constitution. You know as a conservative, I'm a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution and I think in this case the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process.\" Ryan and Mr. Trump have clashed in the past, particularly during the 2016 presidential election. But the two have, at least publicly, generally made peace and Ryan has been supportive of the president's agenda.\u00a0 Ryan is retiring at the end of the current session of Congress.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Though President Trump has conceded that he lacks proof for his claim that people from the Middle East are \"coming up through the southern border,\" he still thinks \"there very well could be.\" But\u00a0data from the\u00a0U.S. Customs and Border Patrol show that the U.S caught more people crossing the southern border last year from Albania than it did from Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Saudi Arabia combined. The data show that the U.S. apprehended 49 people from Albania along the southwest border of the U.S., compared to 14 from Afghanistan in 2017. In a similar vein, the CBP caught 1,364 people from China, 51 people from Belize, and 433 people from Romania. For Middle East countries, the numbers are substantially lower -- here are some of those 2017 numbers: Figures are similar throughout the past 10 years worth of data from the CPB, across different presidencies. In fiscal year 2016, for instance, 18 people were caught from Afghanistan, compared to 107 from Albania. Six hundred thirty-two people were caught from Bangladesh, and 2,320 from China. The 2016 numbers for Middle Eastern countries show that only 2 people were caught from Iraq, 3 from Egypt, and 2 from Syria. And in fiscal year 2007, 1 person was caught from Afghanistan, 2 from Egypt, and 3 from Syria. By way of comparison, 730 entered the U.S. southern border from China. More broadly, the numbers show more people being caught from the United States' neighbors to the south. CPB caught 127,938 Mexicans crossing the southern border last year. On Tuesday, President Trump admitted he has no proof for the claim he had made Monday morning on Twitter that \"unknown Middle Easterners\" are mixed into the\u00a0caravan of migrants\u00a0heading through Mexico toward the United States. \"There's no proof of anything,\" the president told reporters Tuesday in the Oval Office. \"There's no proof of anything. But there could very well be.\" \"I think there's a very good chance, honestly, that you have people in there,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"I also think there's a very good chance that over the course of a period of time you have. Or they don't necessarily have to be in that group. But certainly you have people coming up through the southern border from the Middle East that are not appropriate for our country. And I'm not letting them in.\" The president's comments came after top administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, defended the president's claims. Mr. Trump has spent the last several days focused on the caravan of thousands migrants, railing against weak border security and faulting Democrats for immigration laws. The president\u00a0has threatened to cut off foreign aid\u00a0to several Central American nations over the episode. With less than two weeks until the midterm elections, Mr. Trump continued today to focus on his vow to tighten U.S. borders. \"We are a great Sovereign Nation. We have Strong Borders and will never accept people coming into our Country illegally!,\" he tweeted\u00a0Wednesday morning.",

            "article_content": "Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott met Tuesday in a spirited debate in their campaign for Florida's highly competitive U.S. Senate seat, with Scott labeling his opponent as a do-nothing senator and Nelson claiming the governor was distorting his record. The CBS News Battleground Tracker rates the race as a \"toss up.\" The event, recorded at the studios of Telemundo 51 in Miramar, will air at 7 p.m. in South Florida, Tampa, Orlando, Fort Myers and West Palm Beach. It can also be viewed on Telemundo's website. Scott, who must leave the governor's office because of term limits, repeatedly said in answer to questions that Nelson had accomplished little on issues ranging from the environment to immigration to Cuba relations, despite decades in the Senate. Nelson is seeking his fourth Senate term. In response to a question about immigration reform, Scott said Nelson \"has had 40 years to do something about immigration and he has done nothing.\" Nelson, however, pointed out that he voted for a comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate six years ago but died in the Republican-led House. He said nine of Scott's television ads on a variety of subjects have been declared false by fact-checking organizations and many of the state's newspapers. \"The governor keeps coming up with one whopper after another. Apparently you never got your mouth washed out with soap for telling a lie,\" Nelson said. The two also clashed sharply on gun violence issues, with Nelson stressing he favors a ban on military-style assault weapons and implementing a comprehensive system of background checks. He noted that Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was slain in the Parkland school shooting, was in the audience. Scott, Nelson said, \"has passed more (National Rifle Association) legislation that any other governor in the history of this state.\" Yet Scott noted that he and the Florida Legislature enacted a broad gun and school safety bill only weeks after the Feb. 14 Parkland shooting. It imposed new age limits on some gun purchases, created a \"red flag\" provision allowing guns to be seized from someone deemed a threat and sought to get more armed security personnel in Florida schools, among other things. \"We passed a comprehensive bill,\" Scott said. \"All these things we did, Senator Nelson has never done.\" Given Telemundo 51\u2032s large Hispanic audience, many questions from the moderators dealt with Cuba relations, the situation in Venezuela and repression in Nicaragua. Both Scott and Nelson sought to underscore their support for helping Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria, with Nelson noting that he was just endorsed Monday by the island's governor, Ricardo Rossello. Both campaigns have strongly courted Puerto Ricans, an important voting bloc in Florida. Scott noted that he has visited Puerto Rico eight times since the storm and has taken numerous steps to help, including dispatching National Guard troops, making it easier for Puerto Ricans in Florida to register for school and providing them an in-state tuition waiver for college. \"It was never about politics, it was about helping our fellow citizens,\" Scott said. Nelson, however, said the administration of President Trump \"has treated Puerto Rico and its people as second class citizens.\" The administration's response to the hurricane, he added \"has been terrible and everybody knows that.\" Mr. Trump endorsed Scott shortly before the Republican primary, and appeared at a rally for him and other Republican candidates in July. Rick Scott of Florida is doing a fantastic job as Governor. Jobs are pouring into the State and its economic health is better than ever before. He is strong on Crime, Borders, and loves our Military and Vets. Vote for Rick on Tuesday! The two also differed on the Affordable Care Act, which Nelson wants to keep and strengthen, but Scott calls deeply flawed and costly. They also sparred on environmental problems that Florida has faced for months, such as fish-killing red tides and algae blooms caused by release of polluted water to the coasts from Lake Okeechobee. Nelson said Scott has \"disassembled\" Florida's environmental regulations and agencies, heightening the problems that beset Florida beaches. \"You see the result. You put pollution in the water, it will grow the algae in the summer,\" the senator said. Scott contended that Nelson hasn't done much in Congress to tackle many of these same problems, including adequate federal funding to fix the aging dike around Lake Okeechobee. \"Senator Nelson has got no money to fix the dike at Lake Okeechobee. Zero dollars,\" Scott said. The pair also disagreed on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, with Scott in favor and Nelson saying he will vote no over the sexual assault allegations leveled by Christine Blasey Ford and other women. Their next debate is scheduled Oct. 16 on CNN.",

Political strategist and longtime McCain aide Rick Davis read McCain's last letter, addressed to Americans, during a press conference on Monday afternoon where he provided details of final arrangements for McCain's memorial services in Arizona and Washington. McCain died Saturday surrounded by family, ending his over year-long battle with brain cancer. In the touching letter, McCain thanked his family, the nation and his constituents he served at home, saying he owed it all \"to America.\" \"To be connected to America's causes -- liberty equal justice, respect for the dignity of all people -- brings happiness more sublime than life's fleeting pleasures,\" wrote McCain. He added, \"Our identities\u00a0 and sense of worth are not circumscribed by enlarged by serving good causes bigger than ourselves.\" McCain, a military war hero often described as a \"true patriot\", said he \"lived and died a proud American.\" \"We are citizens of the world's greatest republic, a nation of ideals not of blood and soil. We are blessed and are a blessing to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals at home and in the world,\" he wrote.\u00a0 In what may have been a veiled criticism of President Trump's desire for a border wall and his immigration policies, McCain wrote this: \"We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been.\" He added, \"We are three-hundred-and-twenty-five million opinionated, vociferous individuals. We argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement. If only we remember that and give each other the benefit of the presumption that we all love our country, we will get through these challenging times. We will come through them stronger than before. We always do.\" In closing, McCain quoted the end of his 2008 concession speech to Barack Obama, ending his missive an acknowledgment that he still had \"the heartfelt faith in Americans that I felt so powerfully that evening.\" \"Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history. Farewell, fellow Americans. God bless you, and God bless America,\" McCain wrote. More from John McCain: \"My fellow Americans, whom I have gratefully served for sixty years, and especially my fellow Arizonans, \"Thank you for the privilege of serving you and for the rewarding life that service in uniform and in public office has allowed me to lead. I have tried to serve our country honorably. I have made mistakes, but I hope my love for America will be weighed favorably against them. \"I have often observed that I am the luckiest person on earth. I feel that way even now as I prepare for the end of my life. I have loved my life, all of it. I have had experiences, adventures and friendships enough for ten satisfying lives, and I am so thankful. Like most people, I have regrets. But I would not trade a day of my life, in good or bad times, for the best day of anyone else's.\u00a0 \"I owe that satisfaction to the love of my family. No man ever had a more loving wife or children he was prouder of than I am of mine. And I owe it to America. To be connected to America's causes \u2013 liberty, equal justice, respect for the dignity of all people \u2013 brings happiness more sublime than life's fleeting pleasures. Our identities and sense of worth are not circumscribed but enlarged by serving good causes bigger than ourselves. \"'Fellow Americans' \u2013 that association has meant more to me than any other. I lived and died a proud American. We are citizens of the world's greatest republic, a nation of ideals, not blood and soil. We are blessed and are a blessing to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals at home and in the world. We have helped liberate more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have acquired great wealth and power in the process. \"We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is spending his summer vacation at his golf club in New Jersey. Wait, don't call it \"vacation.\" Mr. Trump, who is loath to admit to sleeping \u2014 let alone taking time off \u2014 has spent his week away mixing downtime and golf rounds with meetings and dinners, intent on projecting the image that he's been hard at work. Ensconced at his private club, he's surrounded by a clutch of unofficial Bedminster advisers, who have unusual levels of access to a president with the propensity for mixing business with leisure. Not that it was his idea to leave Washington anyway, he contends. \"We're renovating the White House, a long-term project and they approved it years ago. And I said, 'Well, I guess this would be a good place to be in the meantime,'\" Mr. Trump told reporters invited to the property to document a roundtable discussion on prison reform efforts Thursday. \"I miss it. I would like to be there,\" he said of the White House, \"but this is a good way of doing it.\" No staffers had publicly mentioned the need for any rehabilitation work before Mr. Trump's departure, and the explanation effort underscores the president's concern about public perceptions as he approaches having spent 150 days of his presidency at his golf properties. Mr. Trump repeatedly blistered Barack Obama during the 2016 campaign for golfing, telling cheering supporters that as president he'd be far too busy working for them. \"I'm not gonna have time to go play golf,\" he would shout. Does he actually play golf at Bedminster or at his better-known Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida? Yes, but it's hard to say how much. The White House won't say, and reporters are barred from getting close enough to see. All presidents take vacations. Obama and his family spent time on Martha's Vineyard and in Hawaii. But Mr. Trump seems more sensitive about admitting it. \"Had a very good phone call with @EmmanuelMacron, President of France,\" he tweeted Friday, describing it as just one of \"many other calls and conversations,\" including a dinner with Apple's Tim Cook. He has been photographed golfing by social-media-savvy members. But he's spent most of this past week out of outsiders' sight. He's hosted several donor events, including a dinner for \"Protect the House,\" a fundraising committee led by Vice President Mike Pence and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy that raises money for Republican House candidates. On Tuesday evening, he welcomed more than a dozen CEOs, their spouses and staffers for an animated dinner that included frank discussions of trade, immigration and other issues. White House aides have always been leery of\u00a0Mr. Trump's visits to Bedminster where, as at Mar-a-Lago, he can mingle with members without staff \"handlers\" surrounding him. Also, there are fewer staff to try to keep him upbeat and, with some luck, away from the television. The New Jersey golf club is where a brooding Mr. Trump unleashed several of his most inflammatory attacks and where, in spring 2017, he made the final decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, the move that triggered the special counsel's probe into Russian election meddling. During last summer's Bedminster break, he debuted his threat to unleash \"fire and fury\" against North Korea and then made his first tepid response to the racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. This year, Mr. Trump's tweets have included scientifically dubious theories about the raging California wildfires and an insult to NBA superstar LeBron James that to some read as a racial dog whistle. In another early morning blast, he acknowledged that the 2016 Trump Tower meeting at the center of the Russia investigation was indeed arranged \"to get information on an opponent.\" John Catsimatidis, a billionaire businessman and radio host who owns a New York City supermarket chain and attended the CEO dinner, described Mr. Trump as in a \"great mood\" as he promoted the economy and fielded questions, including several on immigration. The president told those in attendance that he was considering signing an executive order to make it easier for top-performing foreign students to stay in the U.S. as well as for companies to hire the foreign workers they need. \"Whatever's needed in America, whether it's truck drivers or programmers, whatever's needed for American companies,\" Catsimatidis said Trump told him. That's the kind of off-the-cuff promise-making that White House aides are on high alert for. The golf club remains open and active when Mr. Trump is on the scene, giving the president a chance to mix with members and, as he delights in doing, dropping in on weddings and parties. It's where his daughter Ivanka married Jared Kushner, and where Mr. Trump, pre-presidency, had planned to be buried. But the casual atmosphere also allows members to buttonhole the president to push him on pet issues. While the Mar-a-Lago crowd has a reputation among White House staffers for being dominated by aging socialites with few real-world concerns, Bedminster regulars tend to be lower-key members of the tristate-area elite whom Mr. Trump likes and respects and to whom he may be more amendable to listening. The atmosphere is also much more casual than Mar-a-Lago, where high-society Palm Beach members reserve tables and dress to the nines hoping to see or be seen. There, Mr. Trump is constantly approached for photos or to broach odd ideas about world peace or pet issues. In Bedminster, the members are more reserved, but when they do come up to Mr. Trump with ideas, they are usually more serious and Mr. Trump is more likely to direct staff to follow up, White House aides say. Members and White House aides say Mr. Trump appears to be more comfortable at Bedminster, which, according to one member who enjoys reciprocal privileges, has a \"totally different\" vibe. Mr. Trump does meet with staff and has been speaking by phone with Pence, his secretary of state, his national security adviser and congressional leaders. But he's rarely seen in a suit jacket and tie and has proved to be more unchecked at the property, which is dotted with trees, ponds and green lawns. \"It's beautiful,\" Catsimatidis said the day after his first visit. \"The beauty was far beyond what I imagined.\"",

            "article_content": "Kathy Kraninger, the president's nominee to head the main federal agency tasked with protecting consumers from financial abuse, failed to sway Democrats after a three-hour hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.\u00a0 Under questioning from lawmakers, Kraninger resisted being drawn out on how she planned to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (redubbed the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection by the Trump administration). Kraninger said in her opening statement that she would strive for transparency and fairness in leading the agency, which since its founding in 2010 has become a symbol of the partisan political divide on government regulation.\u00a0 But she mostly avoided direct answers when asked about the bureau's recent changes to its approach, such as pulling back on enforcement actions against financial companies. \"Credit bureaus seem most directly in Kraninger's spotlight, which suggests continued risk for Equifax, Transunion and Experian,\" wrote Jaret Seiberg, analyst for Cowen, in a research note. \"She also suggested a continued focus on Wells Fargo and student lending, though she appears more focused on government loans than private loans.\" Kraninger, 43, was a relatively unknown mid-level bureaucrat working at the Office of Management and Budget, overseeing roughly $250 billion in federal government programs, before being nominated by President Donald Trump in June to lead the financial watchdog.\u00a0 Reactions to Kraninger's nomination have fallen along partisan lines, reflecting the differing views of the agency. Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R.-Idaho, said in the hearing that he has \"utmost confidence\" that Kraninger's \"diversity of public service experience\" prepared her to run an agency charged with protecting consumers from financial fraud.\u00a0 But Sherrod Brown, D.-Ohio, predicted Kraninger would follow the approach of Mick Mulvaney, the acting head of the CFPB, who has made the agency much friendlier toward the financial industry. The hearing \"was much more about politics than policy,\" Seiberg wrote. Even Democratic senators representing red states up for re-election this year, such as Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, appeared skeptical of Kraninger's qualifications to run the agency.\u00a0 Pressed repeatedly by Tester, Kraninger said she believed that Mulvaney has done a good job leading the agency. (Mulvaney, who is also Kraninger's boss at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has previously called the CFPB a \"joke\" and said he wanted to eliminate the agency.) She sidestepped repeated questions on whether she would re-institute a rule limiting payday lenders, which Mulvaney has rolled back, and whether she would retain the political appointees Mulvaney hired. \"You got the votes to lead the agency,\" said Tester, visibly frustrated. \"It would be really helpful to know where you're at.\" The Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents who crossed the border illegally dominated the hearing. Kraninger previously worked at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is responsible for implementing the administration's immigration policies. In her current role at OMB, she oversees budget requests at DHS and other government agencies. In response to a question from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D.-Massachusetts, who asked for Kraninger's opinion on the Trump child separation policy, she said, \"It is not appropriate to give my opinion.\" Brown also asked Kraninger about her role at OMB regarding the immigration policy. Kraninger answered that \"it would be chilling to the deliberative process to give you extensive details on the substance of the discussion.\" Kraninger's nomination enjoys the support of the financial industry and of Republicans, who hold a majority in the Senate, making it more than likely that she will be confirmed to the post.\u00a0 In the meantime, Mulvaney can continue as the CFPB's acting director until Kraninger is confirmed. If her nomination fails, the clock on Mulvey's tenure resets while the White House chooses a new nominee, meaning he will likely be overseeing the agency he sought to kill for the\u00a0next year\u00a0or longer. -- The Associated Press contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Kirstjen Nielsen has one hard-earned presidential signing pen. President Donald Trump used the black marker Wednesday to sign an executive order halting family separations at the U.S. border \u2014 then handed it to Nielsen, his Homeland Security secretary. Such pens are typically framed and displayed in lobbies and office waiting areas all over Washington as trophies of presidential proximity and power. Nielsen's was tougher to come by than most. By the time Trump used it to reverse his policy, Nielsen had been both yelled at and praised by Trump and pilloried for repeating his falsehoods. She was forced to deny that the policy amounted to child abuse. On Tuesday night, she cut short a working dinner at a Mexican restaurant after protesters shouted, \"Shame!\" until, finally, she left. Yet there she stood Wednesday in the Oval Office, right at Trump's side, as he reversed the policy she had defended \u2014 and had vowed the administration would not apologize for. With Vice President Mike Pence at Trump's opposite shoulder, the president invited Nielsen to speak. She thanked him for his leadership. \"Great job,\" Trump said over his shoulder to her. He signed the order and handed Nielsen the pen. Bowing to pressure, President Trump signed an executive order ending the process of separating children from families when they are detained crossing the border. The move marks a dramatic departure and raises a host of questions. With that, Nielsen was apparently back in the president's good graces. But fairly or not, the Georgetown and University of Virginia-educated lawyer will probably always be the face of a policy that ignited nearly ubiquitous outrage. According to people close to the secretary, family separations weren't her idea. One person who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Nielsen had been \"working nonstop\" to find a solution. The polarizing path Nielsen has taken is somewhat surprising for a government bureaucrat and policy wonk known more for her loyalty to White House chief of staff John Kelly and her expertise in cybersecurity than for the hard-line immigration views espoused by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House adviser Stephen Miller. Nielsen, 46, was considered an expert in both homeland and national security policy who worked in President George W. Bush's administration and had a role in its handling of Hurricane Katrina. Two years after the 2005 hurricane, Congress issued reports that faulted the White House Homeland Security Council \u2014 where Nielsen directed preparedness and response \u2014 for failing to take the lead in staying on top of the unfolding disaster. Following Trump's election, Nielsen joined the transition team to help guide Kelly through the confirmation process to become Trump's secretary of Homeland Security. Nielsen quickly won the retired general's trust, impressing him with her work ethic and command of the issues. Trump eventually tapped Nielsen to take over as head of DHS, and the Senate confirmed her Dec. 5. By April, Sessions announced there would be \"zero tolerance\" at the border for people crossing illegally. That meant that anyone who did not arrive at a designated port of entry and claimed asylum would be arrested. As public backlash grew, Nielsen misled the public by denying that separating families was part of U.S. policy. While the policy never specifically called for children to be taken from parents, separation became inevitable. That's because adults were detained and charged \u2014 and any children traveling with them couldn't go to jail. Nielsen, like Trump, also suggested that it was up to Congress to fix the problem \u2014 even though the enforcement of laws happens at the president's discretion. The Bush and Obama administrations largely allowed families to stay together. While her allies say she was merely following the law, it is likely there was another reason Nielsen tirelessly defended the policy: She has a track record of working to make her bosses happy. Also, her history with Trump was bumpy. Earlier this spring, Trump had unloaded on Nielsen during a Cabinet meeting over an increase in border apprehensions and legal setbacks, according to people familiar with the exchange but not authorized to speak publicly. Nielsen, one person said, tried to explain that the issues were complex and that the department's powers were limited by legal restrictions. She told the president her team was doing everything it could, but the president was left unconvinced. After news of the dressing-down spread, Nielsen did not deny the meeting had grown heated and issued a statement saying, \"I share his frustration.\"",

            "article_content": "U.S. Senate candidate Joe Arpaio has repeatedly pledged his unwavering support for President Donald Trump, but the divisive retired sheriff is unwilling or unable to elaborate on the president's policies. Arpaio declined at a news conference Tuesday to explain how Mr. Trump's earlier plan to impose tariffs on Chinese imports would affect Arizona residents and whether the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal would make Americans less or more safe. Instead, he focused on his loyalty to Mr. Trump, who nine months ago pardoned Arpaio's criminal contempt-of-court conviction for intentionally disobeying a judge's order in an immigration case. \"I am not a 'yes man,' but I do support the majority of his policies, his agenda, and I'm going to continue doing that,\" Arpaio said. He was unable to name any Trump policies he opposed. The 85-year-old lawman, who lost his 2016 re-election campaign to a little-known Phoenix police sergeant as his legal problems mounted, spoke to reporters Tuesday before handing in petition signatures needed to compete in the Aug. 28 Republican primary in the race to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake. Arpaio faces U.S. Rep. Martha McSally and former state Sen. Kelli Ward in the GOP field. Former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has collected enough signatures to get his name on the ballot to run in the race to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake. The controversial Republican lawman faces two GOP challengers in the Aug. 28 primary. In his 24 years as metro Phoenix's sheriff, Arpaio wasn't known for immersing himself in the policies and inner workings of his office and often prided himself on farming out those details to his underlings. Now, Arpaio is facing tough questions about the details of his beliefs. Those questions led to tense exchanges between Arpaio and reporters shortly before he turned in the signatures. Asked to say how the tariffs threatened by Mr. Trump would affect Arizona residents, Arpaio said only that he wants products to be made in the United States and doesn't believe the approach to tariffs would hurt the state. He also was asked whether he knew what a tariff was. \"I know what tariffs are, but I'm not here to do a history \u2014 to educate you on what a tariff is,\" Arpaio said. Similarly, he declined to say whether the Iran nuclear deal would make the United States safer. \"I don't have all the foreign information,\" Arpaio said. \"You expect me to know everything. I am not in the Senate yet.\" Arpaio, who was known for launching dozens of crackdowns on immigrants as sheriff, bristled when asked about taxpayers' rising bill from his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. Taxpayers in Arizona's most populous county have shelled out nearly $88 million over the last five years to cover legal and compliance costs in a racial profiling lawsuit that focused on his immigration patrols. Arpaio lost the case, and a judge ordered a massive overhaul of the agency. The cost to taxpayers is projected to reach $120 million by summer 2019. Arpaio rejected suggestions that he is to blame for the unexpected costs that arose from his patrols. He blamed the costs on the U.S. judge who ruled that Arpaio's officers had racially profiled Latinos in the patrols and found that the sheriff had ignored his order to stop the tactic. \"It's not my fault. I am not guilty,\" Arpaio said.",

            "article_content": "MEXICO CITY -- The remnants of a migrant caravan of Central Americans that angered President Donald Trump continued their journey north through Mexico toward the U.S. border Wednesday. Organizer Irineo Mujica, speaking from the western Mexico city of Guadalajara, said about 500 migrants had been riding trains north since departing Mexico City last weekend. The caravan that left the Guatemala-Mexico border in late March grew to more than 1,000 migrants who found safety travelling in numbers. In Mexico City, Mujica had said the capital was the caravan's last official stop, but many of the migrants feared going solo on the dangerous final leg north and decided to keep travelling en masse. Some who had split off to press on alone reported back about kidnappings and having their papers for safe passage torn up. \"That caused the group to regroup,\" he said. Mujica said they were headed for Tijuana, where about half planned to go to the border to request asylum in the U.S. Mr. Trump had railed against the caravan, even threatening the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement if Mexico did not stop its progress. The majority were Hondurans fleeing gang violence and the instability that followed the contested re-election of President Juan Orlando Hernandez. Mr. Trump also threatened U.S. aid to Honduras in a tweet and announced that he was calling for a deployment of the National Guard to the border. When the caravan shrank, Mr. Trump struck a more conciliatory tone crediting the Mexican government's enforcement of immigration laws. For the most part, Mexican authorities issued transit papers to those migrants who wished to request asylum in the U.S. and started paperwork for those who wanted to stay in Mexico. The caravan is an annual, symbolic event held around Easter each year to raise awareness about the plight of migrants. It historically does not go all the way to the border and that was not the original plan this year, Mujica said.",

            "article_content": "A program that temporarily shields hundreds of thousands of young people from deportation was scheduled to end Monday but court orders have forced the Trump administration to keep issuing renewals, easing the sense of urgency. In September, Trump said he was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program but gave Congress six months to develop a legislative fix. Those whose permits expired by March 5 had one month to apply for renewal. A nationwide injunction in January by U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco required the administration to resume renewals but does not apply to first-time applicants. Here is where DACA stands on the day it was set to expire: WHAT IS DACA? President Barack Obama introduced DACA in June 2012 by executive action, giving hundreds of thousands of people who came to the country illegally as children two-year, renewable permits to live and work. To qualify, they needed to have arrived before their 16th birthday, been under 31 in June 2012, completed high school or served in the military, and have clean criminal records. Nearly 683,000 people were enrolled at the end of January, eight out of 10 from Mexico. WHERE DO THE COURTS STAND ON DACA? Alsup ruled Jan. 9 that the administration failed to justify ending the program and that the plaintiffs \u2014 the states of California, Maine, Maryland and Minnesota as well as the University of California \u2014 had a good chance of winning at trial. His nationwide injunction required the administration to resume accepting renewal requests within a week. U.S. District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis in New York later issued a similar ruling. On Feb. 26, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the administration's unusual request to intervene, which would have leapfrogged the appeals court. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals put its review of Alsup's decision on fast track, but legal experts don't expect a decision until June at the earliest. From there, it is expected to go to the Supreme Court, likely keeping DACA alive through November midterm elections. IS MONDAY'S DEADLINE NO LONGER MEANINGFUL? Courts have removed much of the urgency, but DACA recipients whose applications are pending are at risk until their petitions are granted. Former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, now Trump's chief of staff, last year scrapped the Obama administration's policy of limiting deportations to people who pose a public safety threat, convicted criminals and those who have crossed the border recently, effectively making anyone in the country illegally vulnerable. Deportation arrests have surged more than 40 percent under Trump. There were nearly 14,000 people with expired permits who applied for renewals but hadn't received them at the end of January. There were also nearly 22,000 whose initial applications had yet to be decided. DACA advocates are using Monday's deadline to intensify pressure on the White House and Congress for permanent protection. The ACLU said Sunday that it launched \"multiple six-figure advertising buys\" with United We Dream and MoveOn.org, focusing on Trump. WHERE DOES CONGRESS STAND ON DACA? In January, the president proposed a path to citizenship for 1.8 million young immigrants as part of an immigration package that included $25 billion for a wall and other border enforcement measures and sharp cuts to legal immigration. The Senate rejected it. Immigrant advocates and their allies in Congress want a narrower bill that would protect DACA recipients, possibly combined with limited border enforcement measures, but the administration has balked. Trump has repeatedly blamed Democrats for the impasse, while Democrats say he created it by ending DACA. Congress must pass a spending bill by March 23 to keep the government running, giving Democrats a chance to condition support on a DACA bill. Democrats forced a partial shutdown in January with that goal in mind but relented after three days. Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University law professor, says the Supreme Court's refusal to intervene \"throws the DACA program back into Congress' lap.\"",

The longtime Univision anchor spoke on CBSN's \"Red & Blue\" Wednesday about possibly interviewing President Trump, his new memoir and why he was wrong about the Latino vote in the 2016 presidential election. During a 2015 campaign stop in Iowa, Ramos grilled then-candidate Trump on immigration -- only to be forcibly escorted out by a security guard. The clip went viral. Nearly three years after the testy exchange and he isn't optimistic about the prospect of pressing the sitting president for answers.\u00a0 \"At the end of that press conference when I was allowed to go back, he told me, 'We'll talk a lot Mr. Ramos.' That was more than two years ago and it hasn't happened,\" Ramos said. \"He doesn't even talk to people who are not on Fox News. I don't think I'll ever talk to Donald Trump. I have many questions, but I don't think he wants to answer any of them.\"\u00a0 Ramos, who is widely considered to be the \"voice of the voiceless\" within the Latino community, has been critical of Mr. Trump, specifically on issues such as immigration reform, the U.S.-Mexico border wall and ending DACA. The rise and impact of the current administration prompted him to write his book,\"Stranger: The Challenge of a Latino Immigrant in the Trump Era,\" where he talks about being a stranger in his own country -- even as a citizen having lived in the U.S. for decades. \"After 35 years living in the United States with both my children born here, I still feel like a stranger sometimes,\" Ramos said. \"What has happened? Well, Donald Trump has happened. In a press conference in June 2015, he told me 'Go back to Univision.' He really meant go back to Mexico. That's the attack we usually get from people who do not understand the immigrant experience\" Ramos predicted Mr. Trump wouldn't win the 2016 presidential race because he could not \"connect\" with Latino voters. CBS News' Elaine Quijano asked him on \"Red & Blue\" what went \"wrong\" with his prediction. \"I was wrong -- this is what happened: Twenty-seven million Latinos were eligible to vote, only 13 million went to vote,\" he said. \"What happened? I think many were disillusioned with Barack Obama. They realized he didn't keep his word, and the Democrats were going to do the same thing. And they had a candidate who was being anti-immigrant, making racist remarks, and decided they didn't want Donald Trump either. In the end, 14 million Latinos decided to stay home.\" Ramos also chimed in on the news of White House communications director Hope Hicks' resignation. \"The problem is that who believes her after saying that every once in a while she used white lie to explain what was going on in the White House, and I call her and say, can you confirm this, is she lying to us?\" he said. \"The other thing is Donald Trump, her boss, has been lying constantly since he became president.\" Watch Ramos' full interview with CBSN's \"Red & Blue\" by clicking the video at the top of this page.

Axios' co-founders, executive editor Mike Allen and CEO Jim VandeHei, were asked on \"CBS This Morning\" what sort of pressures are driving companies toward taking such a stand.  \"I think there are two things that are hitting a company simultaneously that are really reshaping our relationship with the companies and the companies that we work for,\" VandeHei said. \"One is social media. People can instantly put pressure on companies to make big decisions about their products.  \"Two is (and I see this even at Axios), where the millennial workforce has a different expectation of us as employers, they expect you to take a stand, they expect you to have opinions; they expect you to stand for something bigger than just profit. And companies are feeling this.  \"And you saw this with the Muslim ban, you saw it with immigration, you saw it with global warming, and now you're seeing it with guns, where companies like Blackstone over the weekend, Bank of America over the weekend are saying, listen, we're going to take a look at our clients' relationships with gun manufacturers.

Like all of those, it used to be risky for a brand or a company to talk about it. Now they have to.  \"It's funny; this is partly a Trump effect. Just in the last year there's been something of a change from pulling back to, now you have to speak up.\"  Co-host John Dickerson said, \"That's because purchasers make their decisions every day about whether to fly Delta or not fly Delta. But voters are different in the way they behave -- if you want to punish a lawmaker, you have to wait all the way until November, and in this case you have a calcified group supporting Second Amendment rights. They believe in them very strongly, so you have a pushback, whereas with consumer products you don't really have a pushback.\"  \"For all the people who want change in the wake of this shootings, it has to be in voting,\" VandeHei said. \"Since the 1994 election, the reason that Republicans -- and a lot of Democrats, by the way -- never challenged the NRA is because they believed that it's political suicide to do so. If millennials turn out, if voters who are outraged turn out, and sudden you see members of Congress losing because of the gun issue, it won't just change, it will change like that! It will change instantly.\u00a0 Because lawmakers respond to incentives, and the incentive is for them, I want to keep my job. If you lose your job because of it, the game changes on a debate that was otherwise been defined differently for 30 years.\" Allen noted that the students protesting current gun laws, who have been likened to the \"Freedom Rider\" of the 1960s civil rights movement, will be voters soon \u2013 and companies and lawmakers are starting to realize that a wave of millennials at the polls is coming. \"And just as their consumer behavior is different, they also are a lot more likely to have their own opinions than mirror their folks, or mirror some of the other influencers that young voters have in the past,\" Allen said.  Given President's Trump comments on the issue, including talk of raising the minimum age to purchase assault rifles, VandeHei was asked if he thought things might happen once Congress returns from a break this week. \"This president more than anyone, he does has a super power: He has this ability to get Republicans to do things that we always thought they wouldn't do,\" VandeHei said. \"We saw it play out on deficits; we saw it play out on how Republicans view the FBI.\" But he was not optimistic that Mr. Trump would put forth an effective agenda: \"When he talks in public, he's talking about arming teachers. That's the thing that has him most amped up right now. I don't think anybody thinks that that's the solution, and it certainly is not a pathway to a bipartisan compromise to get significant gun legislation.\"  Allen and VandeHei were also asked about an Axios report that President Trump has been pushing to have the pilot of his personal jet head the Federal Aviation Administration.  \"This is the president of the United States has put forward his personal pilot to run the FAA,\" said VandeHei. \"We joke about it; it's not a joke. It's a massive part of the bureaucracy that regulates what happens in the air.  \"And this is gong to the heart of how Donald Trump does run the presidency like a family business. He's got his son-in-law sitting there making big diseases when he can't clear the background check to be able to get security clearance to have access to the most sensitive intelligence. He's got his daughter, Ivanka, intimately involved in tons of public policy.\u00a0 \"So many days we laugh and laugh, but this isn't normal. It's not normal to have this many family members this intertwined in the operation of a White House, for the obvious reasons. When it happens, it presents conflicts of interest. There's a reason Chief of Staff Kelly is outraged by this, doesn't really want the kids there, because it just makes life more complicated for the people who are there trying to do their jobs and not feel like the deck is stacked because they're not part of the family circle.\" David Morgan is a senior editor at CBSNews.com and cbssundaymorning.com.",

            "article_content": "President Trump is facing outrage over a report that says he ordered special counsel Robert Mueller to be fired last June. The New York Times reports Mr. Trump reportedly backed off after White House counsel Donald McGahn threatened to quit. On Friday, Mr. Trump called the story \"fake news.\" He had said on Wednesday he's \"looking forward\" to speaking with the special counsel. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, reacted to the report, saying the effort or thought to fire Mueller \"would really plunge our country into a constitutional crisis.\" \"To fire the special prosecutor, especially after the fact pattern we're seeing about the firing of the FBI director [James Comey], really presents a problem for our nation as a whole to have an unaccountable president undermining, actively undermining an ongoing investigation into his administration and his campaign where a number of close allies and associates have already faced indictment, have already faced serious levels of investigation,\" Booker said Friday on \"CBS This Morning.\"  He and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., presented a bipartisan bill last year that would protect the special counsel and limit the president's power to remove them.  \"The reality is, we are in a position right now where, should the president order firing of the special prosecutor, we really have no check or balance on his power,\" Booker said. \"This is something that is clearly needed right now, and, frankly, it's something that I think would be needed in future generations so that there would be an independent overview of the president's power to remove a special prosecutor. And you have to understand, right now there is no check. There is no presidential accountability. And we believe that should lie with the judiciary.\"  Booker also commented on the White House immigration proposal to create a path to citizenship for so-called \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, in exchange for $25 billion in funding for border walls. He said the current proposal was \"unacceptable\" and defended Dreamers, calling them \"American citizens in every single way except for a piece of paper.\"   \"What is offensive about the president's proposal is he wants to put tens of billions of dollars -- at the time the country is screaming for infrastructure investment -- that many of the best experts of homeland security do not believe we need,\" Booker said. \"This is like money for a 19th century technology at a time that we could use 21st century technology, less expensive to protect our borders. There's not a senator in Congress that doesn't want secure borders, but the way this president is going about it seems to be more about a campaign promise and campaign rhetoric than what's best to secure this country.\"  Booker said Dreamers being used as \"a political pawn right now is to me reprehensible when everyone knows these kids right now are suffering. They're in severe anxiety that's upending their education and their work.\" \"They've served in our military, pledged allegiance to our flag. They've taught in our schools. They're entrepreneurs. They're creating jobs,\" Booker said.",

            "article_content": "Next week, we will see President Trump give his first formal State of the Union address. And with the midterm elections rapidly approaching, he's sure to use the much-watched opportunity to promote his agenda before a national audience.  But what, exactly, will he say? We can't know for certain, but a look at CBS News polling data helps give an indication of the notes he'll try to hit. Mr. Trump is not popular. In fact, if anything, he's consistently unpopular, with his approval rating roughly unchanged since the summer.  Just 37 percent of voters say they approve of Mr. Trump's performance after one year in office, according to the most recent CBS News poll. To put that number in perspective, his approval rating is lower than any of his five most recent predecessors at this stage of their presidencies.  However, Mr. Trump does have one big thing going for him: the economy. The president frequently touts the awesome performance of the stock market in the year since he took office and will almost certainly make mention of this fact when he gives his State of the Union next Tuesday.\u00a0  Americans acknowledge that the economy is doing well, with 67 percent telling CBS that the economy is very or fairly good. They also say that Mr. Trump deserves at least some of the credit. When asked whether the president's policies are responsible for the economic boom, 32 percent said \"mostly\" while 39 percent said \"partially.\" Only 27 percent give his policies no credit for the economy's performance.  Still, a majority of Americans \u2013 53 percent \u2013 say that Mr. Trump's policies haven't had much effect on themselves and their families. So it's fair to expect the president to highlight how a roaring economy, not to mention tax cuts and deregulation, are making the lives of everyday Americans better.  This will be one of the key tests for Mr. Trump when he gives his speech: connecting the abstract to the particular. By a number of different metrics, the economy is doing well. But Americans still feel like they're not getting the benefits of the boom, with 49 percent telling CBS News that the country is being run for the benefit of elites.  Mr. Trump ran on a populist message and promised to deliver for working people. On Tuesday, he'll have a chance to argue that he's delivering on that promise. That brings us to\u2026 The GOP managed to pass tax cuts in December despite the bill's widespread unpopularity. Now Republicans are hoping that the tax cuts will gradually become more popular as Americans start keeping more of their money.  Congressional Republicans had planned to spend January selling their tax cuts to skeptical voters, a plan that was quickly scuttled amid controversies over immigration, Mr. Trump's \"sh*thole\" remarks, and the government shutdown. But with the shutdown ended, Mr. Trump has an opportunity to trumpet his signature legislative accomplishment, so expect a lot of talk about how the tax cuts help working Americans.  Mr. Trump may have his work cut out from them on that score, however. Only 22 percent of Americans say that Congress is making economic policy for the benefit of the middle class, while 85 percent they have the interests of big campaign donors at heart. A plurality of Americans \u2013 42 percent \u2013 say the tax cut bill won't make much difference to them personally, and only 27 percent think that their taxes will actually be lowered.  This is dangerous polling territory for Mr. Trump, who was elected in part because of his support among blue-collar voters who traditionally vote Democratic. He needs to reassure these Americans that he still has their best interests at hear. And a good way to do that would be to talk about\u2026 When asked what the top priority for the Trump administration should be in the new year, 56 percent chose \"building infrastructure like roads and bridges.\" Roads and bridges may be popular, but walls are not. Only 26 percent said building a wall along the southern border should be a top priority, and only 11 percent said the White House should concentrate on getting rid of Republicans who aren't loyal to Mr. Trump.  In 2016, Mr. Trump promised that infrastructure spending would be a priority for his administration. And when he signed the tax cut bill late last year, he said that infrastructure would now be his priority. \"People want it \u2013 Republicans and Democrats,\" he told reporters. \"We're going to have tremendous Democrat support on infrastructure, as you know. I could've started with infrastructure \u2014 I actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road. So we'll be having that done pretty quickly.\" So far, the administration has not released a detailed infrastructure plan. But it shouldn't come as a surprise if Mr. Trump devotes a fair amount of his speech to touting new infrastructure initiatives. It's a popular issue with bipartisan appeal, and something that Republicans in Congress can run on in November, should they get some big projects done. After all, everyone likes smoother roads and safer bridges, even if some conservatives will balk at paying for improvements. We sometimes think of politics in a binary way: Either you love Mr. Trump, or you can't stand him. But most Americans fall somewhere in between, meaning Mr. Trump has an opportunity to increase his support.  Only 18 percent of Americans define themselves as \"strong\" Trump supporters, while 41 percent say they \"strongly against\" Mr. Trump. Still, 23 percent of voters say they support Mr. Trump and will continue to do so if he delivers what they want, while 18 percent say they don't support him but will reconsider doing so if he does a good job.  This doesn't mean that Mr. Trump is likely to become popular anytime soon -- his disapproval ratings have been on the rise. But he's fulfilling the desires of some voters, such as those who want tough new immigration restrictions and a border wall. He will inevitably alienate others, such as the majority of voters who think a border wall is a bad idea and want protections for \"Dreamers.\" But it does mean that Mr. Trump's base has room to go \u2013 or, on the flipside, shrink.  In other words, Americans are still persuadable when it comes to judging the Trump presidency, and the State of the Union offers Mr. Trump a tremendous opportunity to persuade them.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Trump on Wednesday said he is \"looking forward\" to being interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller in the investigation into Russian election meddling and any ties to Trump associates. \"I would do it under it under oath,\" and, \"I would love to do that as soon as possible,\" the president told reporters at the White House Wednesday. The president expects that to happen in the next two to three weeks, pending his attorney's approval. The president also said he did not remember asking FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe about his voting record, but said he didn't think such a question is a big deal. CBS News\u00a0has previously reported that Mr. Trump's legal team has had specific discussions with Mueller's team about the legal standard for interviewing a president\u00a0and the form such an interview could take. The discussions have involved, for example, whether the interview can be written questioning as opposed to in-person questioning. Mr. Trump's lawyers had met with Mueller and his team on Dec. 22, according to two sources with direct knowledge. Mr. Trump also said Wednesday that he is open to a path to citizenship for all Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients after 10 to 12 years, if they have no criminal record. It's a stance that, if it holds, could frustrate many of the most conservative members of his party. Asked about a pathway to citizenship for DACA, the president said: \"We're going to morph into it It's going to happen at some point in the future over a period of 10 to 12 years. Somebody does a great job. They worked hard. It gives incentive to do a great job. They've worked hard. They've done terrifically. Whether they have a little company or whether they work or whatever they're doing -- if they do a great job, I think it's a nice thing to have incentive of, after a period of years being able to become a citizen.\" Mr. Trump, asked if he might extend the March 5 deadline for phasing out DACA if there isn't a legislative deal by then, said he \"might.\" \"Yeah I might do that. I'm not guaranteeing it ...\" the president said. Mr. Trump said DACA recipients \"should not be concerned\" about being deported after March 5. The president told reporters wants $25 billion for a border wall with Mexico and $5 billion for other security measures -- $30 billion in total. The president said he thinks he will get a wall and great border security. The president said he wants to deal with DACA first, then move to a broader immigration bill that will deal with things like chain migration. \"Well I can tell you this -- if you don't have a wall you don't have DACA,\" Mr. Trump said. Earlier this month, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, suggested Mr. Trump may not be able to extend DACA, because he announced the end of the program by deeming the Obama administration's creation of the protections unconstitutional. \"I don't believe the president can extend this by executive order, and March 5, a lot of bad things begin to happen,\" Graham said earlier this month. Still, after Mr. Trump's comments were reported, Graham called the president's remarks about a possible pathway for citizenship a major breakthrough. \"President Trump's support for a pathway to citizenship will help us get strong border security measures as we work to modernize a broken immigration system,\" Graham said in a statement his office issued. CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett, Jacqueline Alemany and Kathryn Watson contributed to this report.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Vice President Mike Pence says reports that an adult film star had an alleged affair with President Trump are \"baseless allegations.\" Pence spoke to The Associated Press during a visit to Jerusalem on Monday. He said he was \"not going to comment on the latest baseless allegations against the president.\" The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr.\u00a0Trump's personal lawyer brokered a payment to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels in October 2016 to prohibit her from publicly discussing the alleged affair before the presidential election. Daniels' real name is Stephanie Clifford. Mr. Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, has denied there was any relationship. He gave the Journal a statement from \"Stormy Daniels\" denying receiving \"hush money.\" The AP reported that a tabloid magazine held back from publishing her 2011 account of the alleged affair after Cohen threatened to sue. In that same interview, Pence also defended Mr. Trump over his disparaging comments about immigrants from Africa and Haiti. Pence told the AP that he \"knows the president's heart.\" He says Mr. Trump is determined to implement a merit-based system that encourages immigration by those who will \"contribute to a growing American economy and thriving communities\" and one that does not take into account the immigrants' \"race or creed.\" He was responding to reports that Mr. Trump last week in a private meeting made vulgar and disparaging remarks about immigration from countries in Africa and Haiti and said the U.S. should welcome more immigration from countries like Norway. During a joint statement with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later on Monday, Pence also addressed the Senate's compromise to reopen the federal government which was reached on day three of the government shutdown.\u00a0 \"Let me say we welcome the news that thanks to the firm stand taken by President Trump and House and Senate Republicans, the government shutdown in Washington, D.C. is coming to an end.\"\u00a0 He added, \"The Schumer shutdown failed. The government is reopening, congress can get back to work advancing the president's agenda.\" Pence had urged members of congress during his overseas trip to the Middle East to reach a deal over funding of the federal government, saying the Trump administration was \"not going to put up with it.\"\u00a0 As Pence spoke to troops stationed near the Syrian border, he continue to slam Congressional Democrats for \"playing politics with military pay.\" \"You and your families shouldn't have to worry for one minute whether you are going to get paid as you serve in the uniform of the United States,\" Pence said. He added, \"We aren't going to re-open negotiations on illegal immigration until they re-open the government and give you our soldiers and your families the benefits and wages you've earned.\" Prime Minister Netanyahu joked to Pence before departing for dinner, \"You're all invited to our budget deliberations in the Knesset in the coming weeks.\" Earlier,\u00a0\u00a0Pence delivered remarks to the Knesset\u00a0where he reaffirmed the United States' commitment to its long-held ally in the region and announced the move of the U.S. embassy in Israel would be taking place next year ahead of schedule.\u00a0 Pence is set to pay a visit to Israel's Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem and the Western Wall during his final day in Israel.\u00a0 The visit, initially scheduled for December before being postponed, is the final leg of a trip that has included talks in Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The first government shutdown since 2013 is entering its second day with few signs that Congress will be able to reach a deal on spending and immigration and reopen the government.\u00a0 Members of both parties are exchanging charges of blame for the stalemate. Republicans want Democrats to agree to a short-term spending bill while lawmakers continue work on an immigration package, while Democrats demand an immigration deal be included in any spending agreement. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois is one of the Democrats leading the charge in the Senate. He joined us Sunday to discuss the shutdown and where lawmakers go from here. The following is a transcript of the interview with Durbin that aired Sunday, Jan. 21, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: And we're back with the Senate Democratic Whip, Richard Durbin. Senator, welcome. There seems to be a deal in conversation about opening the government up, funding it for a few more weeks if there's a promise there will be an ultimate vote on DACA. Is that something Democrats can agree to? RICHARD DURBIN: Well, I can tell you we're working on it on a bipartisan basis, and I'm glad we are. I'm sorry we're in this situation, but I think it bears repeating how we got here. The Republicans are in control of every branch of government, the presidency of course, the House, the Senate, and through their nominees, the Supreme Court. And the Republicans are in complete control of the business that comes before the House and the Senate. Speaker Ryan is a friend of mine, another Midwesterner, he overlooks the fact that the president challenged us on September the 5th to deal with the DACA problem. And as yet, we haven't seen any hearings on any bills in the Senate. JOHN DICKERSON: But the Senate needs 60 votes, and Democrats are the ones who voted to not get the 60 and-- RICHARD DURBIN: And that is-- JOHN DICKERSON: the (UNINTEL) vote I should say. RICHARD DURBIN: --but let me just add, and I think this is key and why we call it the Trump Shutdown, there was an effort made at the invitation of President Trump for Chuck Schumer to come to the White House on Friday and avoid this. They sat down for lunch, four of them, both president, Schumer, each of them brought their aides (John Kelly and Mike Lynch) and they reached a basic agreement. In that agreement, Chuck Schumer made major concessions to the president to get this job done. Two hours later the White House called and said, \"It's over, we're not interested.\" JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0And I want to get to those other concessions in a minute. But okay, so there's a little floppiness. Why not keep the government open and figure it out over the next few little periods? You guys - You're pretty close, why-- RICHARD DURBIN: \u00a0This is the-- JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0--shut the government down? RICHARD DURBIN: --this is the fourth continuing resolution. There's been a consistent failure by the Republican leadership in Congress to deal with these critical issues. We don't want to see this situation as it currently exists, but we want to see a solution that has meaning and one that will serve this nation. We're lurching from one continuing resolution to the next. Do you know what the Secretary of Navy said? \"Continuing resolutions have cost the United States Navy $4 billion.\" JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Well, that-- RICHARD DURBIN: Enough for us to make sure not only sailors are paid, but that we build the resources we need to keep the nation safe. JOHN DICKERSON: But here's the thing, Democrats are contributory in this mess everybody is in. And by choosing to force this into a shutdown situation, everybody's now going to their corners, the president's running the kind of ads he is. Does that befoul things so badly that you can't get an agreement? RICHARD DURBIN: It doesn't have to. Do you remember January 9th, you might have seen the president left the cameras on in the cabinet room and we sat with him? I was sitting right next to him, it was the fourth time we'd ever had a conversation. And we were talking about DACA and Dreamers, and the president said, \"You send me a bill and I will sign it.\" Within 48 hours, Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and I presented a bill to him which was summarily rejected. So what happened to Schumer happened to us. We can't reach the agreement we need for this nation without leadership from a president. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me interrupt you there, we'll be right there, Senator hold on a moment. We'll need to take a break, but we've got more questions for the senator and we'll be right back, stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation\" and our conversation with the number two Democrat in the Senate, Richard Durbin. Senator, I want to read you some quotes here from various people, including Senator Schumer who in 2015 said, \"A government shutdown would deal a huge blow to our economy.\" Bernie Sanders said, \"It is wrong for the right-wing Republicans to ignore the results of the last election and hold the American people hostage by threatening to shut down the government.\" You said, \"Open the government. When you open the government, we'll open negotiations.\" So why was it bad then and okay now? RICHARD DURBIN: It's not a good thing to do at any point. We have reached a desperate situation. This was the fourth continuing resolution. The Republican-controlled Congress has refused to fund the government, been unable to fund the government. They can't resolve the issues within their own ranks. And so they give us one continuing resolution after the next. And now we are piling up all the things that need to be done. And now we are facing a deadline created by President Trump when it comes to DACA. So we feel there's a urgency for us to come together and do it quickly. And I hope it's just a matter of hours or days. But we need to have a substantive answer. And the only person who can lead us to that is President Trump. This is his shutdown. JOHN DICKERSON: The dead - They obviously say it's yours. And that's what we're in. But the deadline's not till March. Why shut things down now? RICHARD DURBIN: Listen. It's been four and a half months since President Trump set this deadline and said that 780,000 young people who are protected in this country from deportation and can legally work are going to start losing that protection 1,000 a day on March 5th. What had the Republicans in the Senate done in the four and a half months since? Nothing. What we have done, three Republican, three Democratic senators, is to craft a bill, to put this bill before our colleagues and to put it before the president on a bipartisan basis. We're trying to solve the problem the president created. JOHN DICKERSON: Speaker Ryan, you heard him. He was out here. He said, \"They've had their solutions on DACA, but it's the Senate Democrats who are filibustering.\" RICHARD DURBIN: \u00a0What he said unfortunately-- and Paul's my friend -- is, he refers to this bipartisan negotiation. Kevin McCarthy, whom I like very much. We've been doing this for 12 days. 12 days with this deadline looming. Our bill that we crafted, our bipartisan bill, took four months. We took it seriously. We took the president's invitation to offer a bill seriously, as Chuck Schumer did when he went down to the White House. President Donald Trump has to step up and lead us at this point. He can do it. JOHN DICKERSON: You know, you've gone back to the president's comments where he said, \"I'll take whatever bill.\" But it's perfectly reasonable for a president to take into consideration all the moving pieces. If he says, \"Okay, we'll go with the Durbin bill,\" that'll never pass the House. Plus, he's got his own constituencies. I mean, he's allowed to change his mind, isn't he? RICHARD DURBIN: \u00a0Of course he is. But at some point he has to make a decision. Make a decision about whether or not we're going to forward as a nation. That's what we've been waiting on. And as we look at this issue, whether it's DACA or the larger agenda that Chuck Schumer has addressed, he'll make a decision, he'll embrace it, and with - within two hours do a pirouette and be off in another direction. JOHN DICKERSON: What is the position among Democrats right now on funding the wall? The president wants 18 billion or 20 billion. Is there a number now that Democrats are-- RICHARD DURBIN: Chuck Schumer made a significant offer to the president. And it wasn't just an authorization, although I think that is the way you run a government. You authorize a project, and then you say to the administration, \"Give us your plans. How are you going to spend the money? We don't want to waste it.\" But he also made a concession to the president on actual appropriations so the president would not be slowed down at all. Do you know how much money from the 2017 appropriation for walls, and fences, and barriers has been spent so far? One percent. JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Did he meet the president's terms in that meeting? RICHARD DURBIN: \u00a0I think he did because the president said, \"We have an understanding.\" Two hours later, called him and said, \"It's off.\" JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about that Oval Office meeting. It's been adjudicated like crazy. But you have Republican senators questioning you. What does that make the cloakroom like when you're passing them? Do you say, \"Hey, wait a minute. You've said I told an untruth, and don't go doing that\"? I mean, it should lead to confrontation of some sort. RICHARD DURBIN: \u00a0John, I stand by every word. My Republican colleagues know exactly what the president said. And I do, too. I was the only Democrat in the room. At least one of the Republicans, Lindsey Graham, has said that I was accurate, what I said. Others have said they've forgotten. We had the Secretary Nielsen of DHS. She seemed to forget the words that were said. I can't forget them. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Senator Durbin, thanks so much for being with us. And we'll be right back with our panel.",

            "article_content": "Just two weeks into the new year and there's no shortage of political news -- a glimpse at the headlines of the past couple of weeks reveals escalating tensions with North Korea, punctuated by the battle of the nuclear buttons. Then, the president won praise this week for inviting reporters to view nearly an hour of negotiations with lawmakers over immigration, in particular, how to address the plight of DREAMERS, immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. The next day, still on immigration, in another meeting with a handful of lawmakers in the Oval Office, the president wondered why the U.S. wants to bring in \"all these people from sh*thole countries,\" instead of, say, countries like Norway. Mr. Trump also reflected this week on his administration's accomplishments over the past year: the stock market has been hitting record highs, African-American unemployment rate is at an all-time low, and, together with Republicans in Congress, he pushed through the first piece of tax reform legislation since the 1980s. CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett sat down with POLITICO Playbook's Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman Thursday over a mountain of breakfast tacos to hash all of this out and figure out what the year ahead holds. For instance, is there a real genuine chance for bipartisanship?\u00a0 \"I would say no,\" Palmer opined. \"That's pretty depressing, but I think -- listen, it's the 'Kumbaya' moment where they want to say that kind of thing, but we are clearly headed into, very quickly -- political 2018 midterms.\" She added that Republicans have done nothing so far -- not on tax cuts or health care -- \"to actually reach across the aisle. \"It's hard to see them do that now when they're talking about entitlement reform or infrastructure,\" Palmer said. And both of those require Democratic buy-in to get done. But there is one area where the two factions might find common ground: the battle against opioid use in America. \"That's something that I could see Democrats getting on board [with],\" Sherman said. \"And I really do believe there will be something on that because that is an issue that affects every district...If they do it, it's a big political victory.\" And political victories are what politicians can never really stop chasing during their time in office. \"I think the reality is that the minute the election happens, members of Congress and even the president, are running for their re-election,\" Palmer said. \"Anything they do is kind of precipitated based on that. But they're also fundraising, they're also looking at who their potential challengers are going to be.\" But lately, Republicans have had the sense that victories are going to be harder to come by in the midterms -- it's apparent in the dozens that are planning their exits. \"Look at the House,\" Palmer told Garrett. \"You have 31 Republican seats open\u2026 there's this kind of almost feeling that you can't get away from that. Republicans feel like they're going to lose control of the House, and they just don't know by how much. And so every move is coordinated based on that feeling.\" For more from Major's conversation with Playbook, download \"The Takeout\" podcast on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Google Play,\u00a0Stitcher, or\u00a0Spotify.

            "article_content": "President Trump is asking Congress to approve $18 billion in funding to finance his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, CBS News confirmed Friday.  The request, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed to CBS News by a White House official, would cover construction of the wall over a decade. The official said that it's a potential ask for lawmakers as they craft border enforcement measures and will be discussed at a Camp David retreat this weekend attended by Mr. Trump, GOP congressional leaders and members of the Cabinet.  An administration official said that the document from the Department of Homeland Security that features the $18 billion request only covers one aspect of Mr. Trump's immigration priorities and was delivered to Capitol Hill to meet a specific request from negotiating team members.  The WSJ report said that the $18 billion would go toward 700 miles of new replacement barriers, expanding the current 654 miles of barrier to nearly 1,000 miles. It's unclear if this funding would be part of any governmentwide spending package that's currently being negotiated in Congress. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, reacted to the report in a letter to House Democrats Friday, \"This is alarming. We must all speak out.\" In recent days, Mr. Trump has said that any legislative deal to protect so-called \"Dreamers\" and make the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program permanent\u00a0must \"secure the wall.\"\u00a0The president tweeted last Friday: \"The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc.\" He added: \"We must protect our Country at all cost!\" Prototypes for the border wall were completed in October and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said at the time that it would soon begin testing them. The administration may be preparing for the wall, but Congress has not allocated funding for it. Funding has been repeatedly blocked by Democrats whose votes Republicans need for spending bills in the Senate. Spending legislation requires 60 votes to advance in the upper chamber and Republicans only have 52 members. If the president fails to deliver on the border wall, that could hurt Republican candidates in November. On the other hand, if Dreamers don't receive further protections, that could also alienate Hispanic voters and hurt GOP election chances as well. CBS News' Margaret Brennan and Katie Ross Dominick contributed to this report. Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK - Ride-hailing companies are capitalizing on voter enthusiasm ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections by offering free or discounted rides to the polls in shared cars, bikes and scooters. They say they're aiming to remove what many consider a barrier to voting: lack of transportation. Midterm elections are often marked by low voter turnout, but political watchers are expecting voter angst over which party will control the U.S. House and Senate, as well as lingering anger by both major parties over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, to drive more Americans to cast votes. \"This midterm election season has gotten in the bloodstream of the American people in a way that has not happened before,\" said Stephanie Young, spokeswoman for When We All Vote, a nonprofit that has partnered with Uber and Lyft to get voters to the polls. When We All Vote is co-chaired by Michelle Obama and helps people register and vote. The organization is technically nonpartisan, but several on its list of celebrity co-chairs such as Tom Hanks and Chris Paul have been vocal critics of President Donald Trump. Lyft is also working with Voto Latino -- whose co-founder Rosario Dawson has urged voters to choose Democrats to combat Trump's immigration policies -- as well as nonprofit organizations that help blind people and student veterans to distribute discount codes and identify where free rides are needed. Lyft's efforts have been promoted on social media by celebrities such as actor Samuel Jackson, another Trump critic. Uber is offering $10 off rides to the polls across the country and added a feature in its app that helps customers find their polling stations by typing in a home address. \"In this critically important election, we want to do our part and use Uber's technology to help drive the vote,\" said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in an email. \"Decisions get made by those who show up, and we believe Uber can help voters show up like never before.\" Zipcar, which allows members to rent cars on an hourly basis, is offering a $20 credit on election night, enough to cover about two hours of driving, said spokeswoman Katelyn Chesley. Zipcar has been offering discounts for election-related rides since the company was founded in 2000, Chesley said. \"There's a lot of people who have really busy schedules during the daytime, and we just really want to make sure every last voice is heard,\" Chesley said. This is the second time Lyft has offered discounted or free rides to the polls and Uber's first. In 2016, 15 million eligible voters cited transportation as a key reason why they didn't vote, according to The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, so \"we want to use our platform to eliminate that pain point from the voting process,\" said Mike Masserman, head of social impact at Lyft, in an email. Motivate, which operates most of the bike-share programs in the U.S., is offering free day passes to ride bikes on Election Day in nine of its markets for the first time. Lime is offering free rides on its bikes and scooters. Uber is cleaning up its public relations image in preparation for an initial public offering next year, and the Election Day promotion is \"a clear sign of extending goodwill to consumers while deploying clever marketing tactics,\" said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director of private investment research at SharesPost. \"Let's not forget that these companies have had a lot of clashes with communities, and this is sort of a nice way for then to show their support for communities,\" said Mike Ramsey, senior research director at Gartner. \"They're probably touching into the Zeitgeist that these elections are very important to a lot of people on both sides.\"",

            "article_content": "Adam Verdugo contributed reporting The Trump campaign launched a $6 million broadcast and digital ad buy Monday to urge voters to back Republicans in next week's midterm elections--without even mentioning the president's name. The minute-long spot focuses on the country's low unemployment rate and improvements in the economy, with the narrator warning that \"this could all go away if we don't remember where we came from and choose the right future.\" The ad aims to give Republicans credit for economic turnarounds that began the Obama years. It includes flashbacks to a 2010 jobs report showing unemployment nearing 10 percent, just two years after the beginning of the financial crisis that started under a Republican administration.  \"Things are starting to change,\" the female narrator says. \"There's more opportunity, and security to invest in the ones that matter.\" The ad features a generic Republican yard sign in a suburban area, representative of the battleground districts for the House of Representatives, and a woman checking the box for a Republican woman candidate on the ballot on Election Day. But it does not mention President Trump himself.\u00a0 Here's the ad: The ad is airing through Election Day. Of the $6 million, $3.5 million is being spent on national television and $2.5 million is being spent online. The ad comes as Mr. Trump is ramping up his campaign schedule in the final stretch of the midterm elections, with stops planned in Florida, Missouri, West Virginia, Montana, Georgia, Tennessee, and Ohio. The president's re-election campaign has spent over $20 million on this year's elections, in which GOP control of Congress is at stake. Last week, the campaign transferred $3 million to the Republican National Committee to benefit campaigns across the country. And by Election Day, Trump will have hosted 30 \"Make America Great Again\" rallies, according to his campaign. The activity shows Mr. Trump's personal investment in next week's elections, which are largely seen as a referendum on his presidency. The president's schedule takes him to states he won, and mostly where Democratic U.S. Senate incumbents are trying to fend off formidable challenges from Republican challengers. But while Republicans running for the Senate may be eager to campaign with the president, many House incumbents are keeping him at a distance, particularly mindful of reaction among suburban women voters who will play a pivotal role in battleground districts. The loss of control of the House would give Democrats subpoena power to look into the president's tax records and potentially move forward with articles of impeachment. And while the ad focuses on the economy, the president is playing into more hot-button issues like immigration and court nominations on the campaign trail -- designed to rally the party base -- and calling the Democratic opposition \"the mob.\" Mr. Trump has seized on news of a migrant caravan traveling from central America to the U.S. border with Mexico. At a campaign rally in Montana earlier this month, he said the midterms will \"be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense,\" referring to the controversial confirmation of the newest Supreme Court justice.  But even as the president demonstrates a personal interest in keeping Republicans in control of Congress, he has said he will not take the blame for losses. \"No, I think I'm helping people,\" the president said In an interview with the Associated Press earlier this month, when asked if he would take responsibility for any negative outcomes.\u00a0 However, he has also acknowledged that November's election has everything to do with him. \"I'm not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket, because this is also a referendum about me,\" he said at a rally in Mississippi earlier this month.\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "CBS News Political Correspondent Ed O'Keefe sat down with Anthony Salvanto, CBS News Elections and Surveys Director, to break down what to look for as the midterm elections near this November for our first edition of the Battleground Briefing, a wonky deep-dive into the numbers driving the unique CBS News/YouGov Battleground Tracker model. If the election were held today, the CBS News/YouGov Battleground Tracker reports a likely toss-up for which party would have the majority. Democrats would most likely get 219 seats the model reports, with a nine seat margin of error.\u00a0 This gap between Democrat and Republican seats will likely continue to fluctuate throughout the midterm election season, as different issues energize voters.\u00a0 The specific issues candidates decide to run on might swing the election in their favor. At a national level, most Republicans want to hear a lot about are immigration, jobs and wages, and health care while Democrats want a focus on health care, income inequality, education and teacher salaries, and jobs, the Battleground Tracker reports. A prime example of how seats may flip political parties are the races in southern California.  In the south of the sunny Golden State, a \"jiu-jitsu race\" is brewing, according to O'Keefe. California's primary system awards the top two finishers a chance to compete in the general election, regardless of party, potentially shutting out some parties entirely come November. Democrats assert there are 10 districts in southern California where they believe they can flip seats from either a Republican incumbent, or a seat vacated by a retiring Republican. Democrats \"believe that because Hillary Clinton won these districts in 2016 that they may have shot here of potentially winning them,\" said O'Keefe. Democrats' excitement has translated to a crowded primary in some districts, with several Democrat candidates trying to out-maneuver each other for the same seat. This could splinter the Democrat's base, opening a door for Republican candidates potentially block out Democrats. So while Democratic primary votes may not be able to guarantee a win for the control of the House in the fall, Salvanto warned, in some races \"they could lose it.\" Democrats have a 14-point advantage among women, and Republicans lead among men by five points, the Battleground Tracker reports. Gender issues, like whether or not women feel as if the president respects them, could be used as motivation to draw out new voters who do not usually vote in the midterms, according to Salvanto.\u00a0 And yet, \"we're old enough to remember 2016 [election] where Democrats were going to win over all of these voters and they didn't do nearly as well as they wanted to so it's clear that this is a group that could swing,\" Salvanto told O'Keefe. Tune in throughout the midterm election season for updates to our CBS News/YouGov Battleground Tracker and new editions on CBSN of our post-game show, the CBS News Battleground Briefing.\u00a0 The CBS News/YouGov Battleground Tracker is run by the CBS News' Election and Survey Unit team: Anthony Salvanto, Jennifer De Pinto, Kabir Khanna and Fred Backus.

            "article_content": "There's a border crisis in Pennsylvania. The radical left is surging in New Jersey. And Nancy Pelosi is a threat to New York. Republican candidates in the nation's premier midterm battlegrounds have embraced a central message in their fight to maintain the House majority this fall \u2014 and it has little to do with the surging economy or the sweeping tax cuts that the GOP celebrated as a once-in-a-generation achievement just eight months ago. Instead, as Republicans enter the final month of the primary season, they're looking ahead to a general-election strategy of embracing anxiety as a tool to motivate voters. That was clear this week as the GOP's closing message in an Ohio special election questioned Democrat Danny O'Connor's connection to Pelosi, the House Democratic leader and preferred super villain for Republicans. \"We wish it got the pitch forks out and it doesn't,\" GOP ad maker Will Ritter said of the Republican tax cuts. Some Republican strategists are frustrated the party isn't focused on the tax law or the broader health of the economy in the run-up to Election Day. Others concede that in the Trump era, there's no better motivator than fear of the other side, particularly the prospect of Pelosi returning to the speaker's chair. The plan had some success in Ohio: The race was too close to call Wednesday as Republican Troy Balderson maintained a razor-thin advantage over O'Connor, staving off an embarrassing GOP debate for now. Going forward, the debate over highlighting the tax law will help determine whether Republicans will maintain control of Capitol Hill after November. While Republicans are reluctant to engage on tax cuts, it's a fight Democrats \u2014 and their voters \u2014 want. \"The tax cuts were for the top ... income earners,\" said George Stringer, a 58-year-old Democrat who lives in Detroit. \"The rich keep getting richer, the poor keep getting poorer.\" In Ohio, which hosted the season's final special election, O'Connor railed against the tax cuts as a giveaway to the rich that threatened Medicare and Social Security. While his Republican opponent may prevail, the 31-year-old Democrat trailed by less than 1 percentage point in a district that's been in Republican hands since before he was born. On the defensive, Balderson appeared in a late ad sitting next to his ailing mother and promising that he wouldn't dismantle the social safety net. It's somewhat similar to the problems Democrats faced in 2010, when they controlled the White House and Congress and managed to pass the most significant health care legislation since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. They celebrated with President Barack Obama in the Rose Garden, only to run from it in the midterm elections that became a disaster for the party. President Donald Trump, plagued by scandal and wed to his Twitter account, sits atop the struggle. Republican pollster Frank Luntz said Trump energizes the Republican base, but that his broadsides and distractions will also alienate the swing voters who tip battleground House districts. \"This is political malpractice,\" he said. \"You can't find me a time in modern times when the economy was this strong and the governing party was headed toward a potential political disaster like this.\" Republicans are also reluctant to embrace their tax cuts because the benefits don't change the household budget for many Americans. The party predicts that will change next year when families file their first tax returns under the new law. But as electoral strategy, that's akin to Democrats in 2010 insisting voters would like the health care law once they understood it. The tax debate comes amid new evidence of a Democratic surge in early elections across America. Michigan Democrats will feature the state's first all-female statewide ticket this November following Tuesday's primary elections. Democrat Rashida Tlaib also won a race to run unopposed for the Detroit-area House seat vacated by John Conyers, making her poised to become the first Muslim woman in Congress. In Kansas, 38-year-old attorney Sharice Davids won her congressional primary and became the state's first Native American and gay nominee for Congress. Both Davids and Tlaib campaigned aggressively against the Republican tax cuts. Beyond avoiding the tax law, there has been a consistent theme for Republicans across House battlegrounds: casting the Democrat as too liberal. A National Republican Congressional Committee ad in Ohio tied Democratic candidate O'Connor to Pelosi and \"the liberal resistance movement.\" A super PAC backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan charged that it was O'Connor who would cut Social Security and Medicare by $800 billion; fact checkers have questioned the accuracy of the attack. In central Kentucky, GOP Rep. Andy Barr is reminding voters that Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot, voted for President Barack Obama and opposes Trump's proposed border wall. In suburban Pennsylvania, vulnerable Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick has warned of \"a border in crisis\" and demanded a surge of immigration enforcement agents. And in New Jersey, Republican Rep. Leonard Lance featured an ad in which Democrat opponent Tom Malinowski calls himself a \"lifelong progressive Democrat\" over and over. Lance also warns of his \"dangerous policies\" like abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Anthony Brindisi, Democratic nominee in an upstate New York district, is the target of an ad from Rep. Claudia Tenney claiming that Pelosi is \"bankrolling\" Brindisi \"because he'll support their radical immigration agenda.\" Brindisi blasted the Tenney ad as dishonest, repeating his general support for border security and opposition to Pelosi continuing as Democratic leader. \"I'd think after almost two years of being in Congress, the first advertisement that my opponent would run would be something about her accomplishments,\" Brindisi said. He's running his own tax ad, localizing the law by highlighting Tenney's campaign support from the cable giant Charter, whose New York subsidiary, Spectrum, has raised rates and spent hundreds of millions on stock buybacks after getting a tax windfall. \"I want to point out to the voters that when we talk about the swamp, this is the worst kind of example,\" Brindisi told The Associated Press. Republicans aren't apologizing for their tax votes, even if it's not at the forefront of their campaigns. Rep. Mimi Walters, a vulnerable Republican in southern California, said in a recent interview that she plans to use it in her paid advertising this fall. But her ads so far this year have focused on other topics. \"In the beginning ... there was a lot of pushback. That's just natural. You're making a big change, and people weren't sure,\" said Walters, who represents one of 25 districts nationally that sent a Republican to the House in 2016 but opted for Hillary Clinton over Trump in the presidential race. \"Now that people have started to see the benefits ... people come up and thank me,\" Walters said, adding that she's \"results oriented\" and pointing to economic growth figures that she says prove \"we made the right decision.\"",

            "article_content": "This was a House election centered around sharply polarized reactions to the presidency of Donald Trump. Exit polling shows that over two-thirds of voters explicitly said that one reason for the vote for the U.S. Senate had to do with President Trump. Over a third of voters (38 percent) attributed their vote partially to opposing Trump, and almost all of them said they voted for the Democratic candidate. Of the 26 percent of voters who said that a reason for their vote was to support Trump, the vast majority voted for a Republican candidate. Looking at opinions of Mr. Trump among all voters, only 44 percent of approved his job performance, with 54 disapproving. Among disapprovers, 90 percent voted for the Democratic House candidate. A similar 88 percent of those who approved of Trump voted for the Republican House candidate. Increased representation of Democrats at the polls also contributed to Democratic victories in the House. More self-identified Democrats than Republicans headed to the polls this year (37 to 33 percent). This represents a shift from 2014 midterm election, when more Republicans showed up at the polls (36 to 35 percent).\u00a0 While these partisan voters continued to display high levels of party loyalty in this year's House elections, independent voters flipped their partisan preference sharply compared to 2014. That year, they leaned Republican by 12 points, but this election they supported Democrats by 12 points. Given this composition of the electorate, not surprisingly, more voters reported having a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party (49 percent) than the Republican Party (43 percent).\u00a0 New voters also played an important role in Democrats winning the House. Seventeen percent of voters were first-time voters, and the majority of these voters cast their House ballot for the Democratic candidate. Key issues on the minds of voters also favored Democrats. The issue most commonly mentioned by voters as the most important one facing the country was health care (42 percent), and among voters who said so, 76 percent voted for the Democratic candidate for the House.\u00a0 Voters concerned with immigration favored Republican candidates, but only half as many voters picked this issue as most important. A majority (70 percent ) of today's voters say that the health care system needs major changes, and a clear majority of them favored Democratic candidates. By a margin of 58 to 34, voters said that the Democratic Party would be better able to protect people with pre-existing conditions. Not surprisingly, the overwhelming majority of these voters supported Democratic candidates. About the authors:\u00a0David R.

            "article_content": "President Trump's chief diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said Mr. Trump and Putin should meet as planned on Monday in Helsinki, Finland.\u00a0 \"I am confident that President Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin will put America in a better place. It's very important that they meet,\" Pompeo told journalists traveling with him. Pompeo's comments come as some Democrats call on the president to cancel his meeting with Putin or decline to meet with him one-on-one unless he stands up to the foreign leader, particularly after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of election meddling.\u00a0 Mr. Trump says he will bring up election meddling with Putin, but according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, only Putin, Mr. Trump and interpreters will be in the room -- and that, he claimed to the Russian outlet RT, is what the U.S. requested. The meeting will be followed by a joint presser, a White House official told the press pool. Mr. Trump spent part of Saturday playing golf and tweeting about his predecessor and CNN, which he accuses of covering him unfairly. Aides had said Mr. Trump would spend the weekend preparing for Monday's meeting with Putin.\u00a0 I have arrived in Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings, calls and hopefully, some golf - my primary form of exercise! The weather is beautiful, and this place is incredible! Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin. Mr. Trump was later seen on the links. A BBC reporter recorded footage of him waving at protesters as they shouted \"No Trump, No KKK, No Racist USA!\" before resuming his game. The protesters were among the thousands of people who came out in Scotland and England to protest the U.S. president's visit to both countries. Some 10,000 people marched Saturday through the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, while police tried to find a paraglider who breached a no-fly zone and flew a protest banner over the resort in western Scotland where Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, are staying through Sunday. Anti-fascist groups and political activists were joined by others waving an array of makeshift anti-Trump banners who said they had never demonstrated before. Some signs of their said \"We Shall Over Comb\" and \"Dump Trump.\" The glider carried a banner that said \"Trump: Well Below Par\" over Mr. Trump's resort Friday night to protest his environmental and immigration policies. Scores of anti-Trump protesters also turned out in London during Mr. Trump's visit to England earlier this week. In Saturday's tweets, Mr. Trump cast blame on former President Barack Obama for failing to stop Russian election meddling. It was Mr. Trump's first personal response to indictments announced Friday in Washington against the 12 Russian military intelligence officers who allegedly hacked into the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival, and the Democratic Party, and released tens of thousands of emails in a sweeping Kremlin conspiracy to help Mr. Trump win the 2016 election. \"The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration,\" Trump tweeted, asking why they didn't \"do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election?\" The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration. Why didn\u2019t they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election? \"These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn't Obama do something about it?  Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, that's why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration, but Fake News doesn't want to report the truth, as usual!\" the president said in another tweet later in the day. These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn\u2019t Obama do something about it?  Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, that\u2019s why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration, but Fake News doesn\u2019t want to report the truth, as usual! The White House had already responded to the news of the indictments in a statement that highlighted how no Americans are charged, and failed to condemn the alleged hacking. \"Today's charges include no allegations of knowing involvement by anyone on the campaign and no allegations that the alleged hacking affected the election result. This is consistent with what we have been saying all along,\" White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said Friday.\u00a0 Mr. Trump denies that he or any campaign aides were involved with the Russian campaign. He repeatedly dismisses the ongoing investigation that produced Friday's indictments as a \"witch hunt.\" Mr. Trump on Saturday also mocked CNN President Jeff Zucker as \"Little Jeff Z\" and knocked its election coverage following a spat with a CNN correspondent at a news conference Friday in England. Although Mr. Trump said he plans to raise election meddling with Putin when they meet Monday at the Finnish presidential palace in Helsinki, he has also said he doesn't expect Putin to ever accept blame. \"I will absolutely bring that up. I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'\" Mr. Trump said Friday, referring to Putin, during a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. The Kremlin, for its part, has dismissed the indictment as incredible, and says it was intended to \"spoil\" the atmosphere ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting.\u00a0 \"It is regrettable that the circulation of false information in Washington has become the norm, and that criminal cases are brought for obvious political reasons,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said Friday. Leading Democratic senators asked Mr. Trump in a letter Saturday to scrap the summit \"if you are not prepared to make Russia's attack on our election the top issue you will discuss.\"\u00a0 Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain, a leading Republican senator and Trump critic, has said Mr. Trump must hold Putin accountable or else he should not proceed with the meeting. \"President Trump must be willing to confront Putin from a position of strength and demonstrate that there will be a serious price to pay for his ongoing aggression towards the United States and democracies around the world,\" McCain said in a statement. \"If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward.\"",

            "article_content": "TOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach's lead over Gov. Jeff Colyer in the Republican primary has shrunk to only 91 votes after election officials discovered a mistake in the listing for one county's results in the state's tally of votes. The discovery cuts Kobach's already slim lead in half. The lead is minuscule when compared with the 311,000 votes cast.\u00a0 The final, unofficial results posted on\u00a0the secretary of state's website show\u00a0Kobach winning Thomas County in northwest Kansas, with 466 votes to Colyer's 422. But the tally posted by\u00a0the Thomas County clerk's office\u00a0shows Colyer with 522 votes, or 100 votes more for him, a number the clerk confirmed to The Associated Press on Thursday. Bryan Caskey, state elections director, said county officials pointed out the discrepancy Thursday following a routine request for a post-election check of the numbers to counties by the secretary of state's office. County election officials have yet to finish counting late-arriving mail-in ballots or provisional ballots provided to voters at the polls when their eligibility wasn't clear.\u00a0 \"This is a routine part of the process,\" Caskey said. \"This is why we emphasize that election-night results are unofficial.\" Thomas County Clerk Shelly Harms said it's possible that her handwriting on the tally sheet faxed to the secretary of state's office was bad enough in the rush of primary-night business that the number for Colyer wasn't clear. \"They just misread it,\" she told The Associated Press. Kobach is perhaps President Trump's closest political ally in the state, and he's a vocal advocate for and strict immigration and voter identification laws. He also served as vice chairman of Mr. Trump's now disbanded commission on election fraud. A report from the committee found no evidence of the rampant voter fraud claims Mr. Trump made. The president tweeted his endorsement of Kobach on Monday, less than 24 hours before the polls opened. Kobach has become a lightning rod in Republican politics, and some Republicans fear he could jeopardize a safely Republican seat in the general election. Kobach, who has echoed Mr. Trump's claims that the country has rampant voter fraud, has yet to bring up that topic after Tuesday night's close results.\u00a0 Colyer's office said the discovery shows how important it is to get the race right.\u00a0 \"The discovery of these 100 votes for Governor Colyer that were not included in Tuesday night's results show the importance of getting this right,\" his office told CBS News. \"This is exactly why you have canvas, this is why you check your math, and this is why Gov. Colyer will ensure that every vote is counted fairly and accurately.\" Kobach has already claimed a \"tentative victory\" in the race.",

            "article_content": " SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah's Mia Love was tabbed as a rising star in the GOP when she became the first black Republican woman in Congress with her 2014 victory. But on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that she became the latest Republican incumbent to fall in the midterm election's Democratic wave that has seen more than three dozen Republican-held seats flipped across the country. CBS News has not yet estimated a winner in this race. Ben McAdams, a Democratic mayor of Salt Lake County, defeated Love by fewer than 700 votes in a back and forth race that took two weeks to sort out in deep-red Utah. Love had a built-in advantage with Republican voters outnumbering Democrats three-to-one in the mostly suburban Salt Lake City district, but she never seemed to catch on with voters the way other Republican incumbents have in the state, said Damon Cann, a political science professor at Utah State University. She tried to distance herself from President Donald Trump on trade and immigration and she highlighted the times she stood up to the president, like when Mr. Trump used an expletive to describe her parents' home country of Haiti. Mr. Trump won Utah in 2016 but the state's voters have long been uncomfortable with his brash style and his comments about women and immigrants. \"She seemed to struggle a little bit more how to strike that balance without losing too many votes,\" Cann said. Mr. Trump didn't appreciate her approach, calling her out by name in a news conference the morning after Election Day, where he also bashed other Republicans who he said lost because they didn't fully embrace him. Love, the first and only black female Republican in Congress, was seeking a third term. She said in a statement she planned to call McAdams, but didn't say if she would concede or congratulate him. She said she's traveling with family for Thanksgiving and won't speak about the race until Monday. \"Regardless of how you voted, I want to express my sincere appreciation to you for engaging in the process,\" Love said. \"It is one of many reasons this is the greatest country on earth.\" McAdams touted himself as a moderate, and not a typical Democrat, in a pitch that seemed to resonate in the district where nearly four in 10 voters are independents. He also benefited from record voter turnout that was driven in part by a medical marijuana ballot proposal that spurred progressive voters to the polls, Cann said. McAdams was an excellent candidate and also probably benefited from displeasure with Mr. Trump and the Republican party, Cann said. \"The winds were all at McAdams' back,\" Cann said. McAdams will become the first Democratic member of Utah's congressional district since 2014 when longtime Rep. Jim Matheson retired. \"This race was about connecting with Utah,\" McAdams said. \"This race was about who was best positioned to serve Utah and working to not get it caught up in a national, partisan election.\" Love finished about 20 votes short of being able to request a recount in a race where about 269,000 votes were cast. This is the second time she has lost a bid for Congress by a razor thin margin. In her first run in 2012, Love lost to incumbent Democrat Jim Matheson by 768 votes. She went on to defeat Democrat Doug Owens in 2014 and again in 2016. For McAdams, it's a victory that validates his reputation as an emerging political force in Utah. He is an attorney who graduated from Columbia Law School and practiced in New York before returning to his home state of Utah. He has been a political figure in the state for a decade. He was elected as one of the few Democrats in the GOP-dominated state Legislature in 2008 and successfully ran for the Salt Lake County mayor's seat four years later. He became known for working with the state's Republican leaders on issues such as homelessness, where he backed a narrow Medicaid expansion to cover treatment and once went undercover as a homeless person when the issue reached crisis mode downtown. McAdams said during the campaign he would not support California Rep. Nancy Pelosi as House Speaker and insisting he'd be able to work with the president. He has already signed a letter along with 15 other Democrats vowing to oppose Pelosi. He sharply criticized Love's support for the GOP-backed tax overhaul and said she had not been available enough to her constituents at town halls. Love pushed back hard, saying the tax overhaul has been good for people in Utah and defending her approach of meeting with voters in smaller groups, on the phone or online. Voter turnout among registered voters was the highest for any midterm election in Utah since 1962 at about 74 percent, according to Justin Lee, the state elections director.",

            "article_content": "President Trump is back in Florida for the second time this week, this time telling a crowd in Pensacola that \"this election is about safety.\" The Saturday night rally was the second of the day for Mr. Trump, who flew in from Montana and held the rally in the airport hangar.\u00a0 Mr. Trump criticized Florida's Democratic candidates, claiming he had \"never received a call from Bill Nelson,\" the state's Democratic senator. Mr. Trump criticized Tallahassee, located about 200 miles from Pensacola on the Florida Panhandle, as \"one of the biggest problem cities in America.\" Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum is the Democratic candidate for governor, and Mr. Trump called him a \"a radical socialist ... who will not do good things for Florida.\"\u00a0 Continuing the theme of safety, Mr. Trump said \"when you people camping out on your front lawn, remember Gillum.\" Mr. Trump praised the area's recovery from Hurricane Michael, which made landfall on the Florida Panhandle on Oct. 10. But he said the hurricane led to some job losses, but \"despite your hurricane,\" jobs were added in October. \"If you add those numbers back in, which I won't bother doing, it's really wild,\" he said about the 250,000 jobs added in October.\u00a0 Other than the increased attention on Florida, Mr. Trump hit many of familiar themes of safety, the economy, immigration, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, \"radical Democats\" and American leaders \"apologizing for your great country.\" He only touched upon the media, briefly saying \"we always debate three people: the person, plus the media, against me.\" Early in the rally, Mr. Trump was halted becaue a woman needed medical attention.\u00a0 Florida was critical to Mr. Trump's victory in 2016, and if Democrats gained control of governorship in particular, it could show that his brand is no longer as potent with Florida voters. The state is also personal for Mr. Trump, who calls his Mar-a-Lago estate the \"Winter White House.\"\u00a0 DeSantis, a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump, is facing Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee. Polls generally show Gillum to be leading Nelson by a narrow margin. A recent CNN poll showed Gillum leading among likely voters 49 to 48 percent. Scott, the current governor of Florida, is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. According to a CBS News Battleground Tracker poll for late October, the two are neck and neck, with both Scott and Nelson receiving 46 percent support from likely voters. The CBS News Battleground Tracker rates that race as a \"toss up.\" This is Mr. Trump's second trip to Florida in the week before the midterm elections. He rallied for DeSantis and Scott in Estero, Florida, on Wednesday. At that rally, Mr. Trump called Gillum a \"Venezuela-style\" dictator who had taken \"bribes.\" Former President Barack Obama, who is similarly making the rounds on the campaign trail stumping for Democratic candidates, campaigned for Gillum and Nelson on Friday. Should Gillum win, he will be Florida's first black governor.\u00a0 Obama gently chastised a heckler for using profanity in front of children. The protester then started blowing a whistle and Obama addressed the individual again. \"If you support the other candidates, then you should support the other candidates,\" Obama said. \"Go to their rallies.\" Periodically the crowd chanted to drown out the protester: \"Bring it home! Bring it home!\"\u00a0 \"Why is it that the folks that won the last election are so mad all the time,\" Obama asked. \"When I won the presidency, at least my side felt pretty good.\" We have seen rhetoric designed to divide us, the former president told the crowd. \"In four days, you can be a check on that kind of behavior,\" Obama said in a speech that embraced themes of inclusivity and social justice. You can choose a more generous vision of America, \"where love and hope conquer hate,\" he said. Caroline Linton contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "With under 10 days left until Election Day, Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and her opponent, Republican Senate candidate Leah Vukmir, were out on the trail, seeking to energize their bases in the closing days of their campaigns, encouraging supporters to vote and to organize. Vukmir and Baldwin also took time to address the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh. In an interview with CBS News at a rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Vukmir expressed sorrow for the victims and their families.\"This is just another one of these perfect tragedies,\" Vukmir said. \"We need to all pull together and pray for these families and do whatever we can to make sure things like this don't happen again.\" Baldwin offered a similar sentiment, tweeting that she has \"the families of Tree of Life Congregation & Pittsburgh first responders in my heart.\" \"My heart is heavy,\" Baldwin said in a statement. \"This gun violence in our places of worship, our schools, & our streets must stop.\" Vukmir does not want to see Congress revisit possible gun control legislation because she believes such legislation could infringe on citizens' Second Amendment rights. \"The attempts to revisit gun control usually will take away the rights of those individuals who are trying to protect themselves,\" Vukmir added. \"People who perpetrate crimes like this are going to get their hands on guns anyway.\" CBS News rates this race as \"Likely Democratic,\" and some polling shows that Baldwin has a double-digit lead over Vukmir among likely voters. Vukmir calls herself an \"underdog in the race\" but added that she believes Republican enthusiasm has increased in the days leading up to Election Day. \"We are excited about where we are at. There is definitely momentum on our side,\" Vukmir said. Attending a pancake breakfast with the Winnebago County Democratic Party in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Baldwin blasted the GOP tax reform bill passed last year, citing the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's analysis that the bill would add $1.9 trillion dollars to the debt. \"We were told it would pay for itself,\" Baldwin said to more than 50 supporters and canvassers. \"It is hard to make a two trillion-dollar mathematical error. You have to work really hard to do that.\" In response to the national debt, McConnell told Bloomberg News in an interview that it is \"pretty safe to say\" that entitlement programs, like Social Security and Medicare, are the \"real driver of the debt.\" Baldwin told CBS News that the idea of potential entitlement reductions \"terrifies\" her and that she learned at a young age from being raised by her grandparents that those programs are \"earned benefits.\" \"I realized that those programs were a lifeline, that they had earned them,\" Baldwin said. Before rallying with other Wisconsin GOP officials at a warehouse, Vukmir acknowledged to CBS News that the federal government has a \"spending problem\" but added that she would like to see Congress balance a budget and restore funding caps before potential cuts to those programs. According to a Treasury Department analysis released earlier this month, the 2018 fiscal year deficit was $799 billion, which is a $113 billion increase from the 2017 fiscal year deficit. This Senate race also features a stark divide on health care policies between the two candidates. Baldwin is a co-sponsor of Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-All legislation and Vukmir is running on repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which she called the \"unaffordable care act\" in an interview. Vukmir also noted that if elected, repealing the ACA would be one of her first priorities in addition to immigration reform in the Senate. Vukmir attacked Baldwin's support for a Medicare-for-All approach, saying at the rally that the plan would kick 3.4 million Wisconsinites off of employer-based insurance. According to an analysis by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, the cost of Sanders' legislation would be $32.6 trillion over 10 years. The primary component of the ACA under debate this election cycle in Wisconsin and around the country is the requirement that insurance companies provide coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Baldwin and other Democrats running for re-election say that if Republicans maintain the majority in both congressional chambers, they will strip those protections by repealing the ACA. Democrats also point to Republicans who support an ACA lawsuit currently in federal court that is aimed at dismantling the law.\u00a0 With health care consistently polling as a top issue for voters, Republicans across the country have campaigned on promises that they, too, will protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\u00a0 In an interview, Baldwin rejected this claim and pointed to Vukmir's voting record as a state senator. \"It is easy for people to look up her voting record,\" Baldwin said. \"She voted with the insurance companies and against Wisconsinites when she voted to deny coverage for people who needed oral chemotherapy.\" Vukmir, who said she supports association health plans and wants to see states determine health care plans, responded to the notion that she and other Republicans would deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions without an alternative that would include those protections. \"That is a big lie,\" Vukmir said. \"That's the lie of this election that is being perpetuated by Sen. Baldwin and other Democrats.\" However, Republican legislation that purports to protect those with pre-existing conditions introduced in Congress in August would not prevent insurers from penalizing such patients. One analyst pointed out, for instance, that under the measure, if it became law, an insurance company could offer a cancer patient a policy that doesn't charge more simply because she is a cancer patient but wouldn't have to cover the care for cancer.\u00a0 The rhetoric intensified this past week in Wisconsin when former President Barack Obama said at a rally at Milwaukee's North Division High School that \"not a single Republican\" joined him and other Democrats in supporting those protections when he took office and when Congress passed the ACA in 2010. \"Since that time, (Republicans) have spent the last 8 years obsessed with trying to undermine, sabotage, repeal that law that makes sure that you're not discriminated against because of pre-existing conditions,\" Obama said on Friday. At a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin on Thursday, President Trump defended Republicans running on health care, vowing that Republicans will \"100 percent\" protect people with pre-existing conditions. Baldwin is one of 10 Senate Democrats who is running for re-election in a state that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. Trump won Wisconsin by less than 1 percent. In the 2016 presidential election, Wisconsin experienced historically low voter turnout, but there is evidence suggesting that more voters are engaged in this midterm election. In 2016, Democratic Senate candidate Russ Feingold, who ran against Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, received more than 337,000 votes in the 2016 Senate Democratic primary. In the 2018 Senate Democratic primary earlier this year, Baldwin attracted much more -- over 512,000 votes. This trend is also apparent on the Republican side -- Vukmir received more primary votes this year than Johnson did in 2016. Wearing a tie-dye shirt with a Rosie the Riveter pin that says \"Resist!,\" Kathy Zuehlsdorf, who attended the pancake breakfast with Baldwin, is involved with the Winnebago County Democratic Party. After Obama carried the county in 2008 and 2012, Mr. Trump won the county in 2016. Zuehlsdorf, who voted for Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, said she is at the Winnebago County Democratic Party's headquarters in Oshkosh nearly every day and said\u00a0she has noticed an uptick in the number of volunteers this cycle. Because of this, she believes a \"blue wave nationally looks good,\" and she thinks that the Winnebago County and Wisconsin' 6th Congressional District is \"shading to blue\" once again. Baldwin noted that she has seen a \"green wave,\" alluding to the cash pouring into Wisconsin from special interest groups, but noted that there is another wave that does not have party identification. \"What I also see is a people's wave, a common-sense wave,\" Baldwin said. \"And it isn't so much blue, red or purple.\" Jeff Krumrich, a retired teacher who lives in Wisconsin's First Congressional District and attended Vukmir's rally, complained that Baldwin would vote down Mr. Trump's initiatives and that she does not have Wisconsin's best interests at heart. Wearing a Leah Vukmir tee and a red \"Keep America Great\" hat, he said he voted for Trump in 2016 and plans to vote for Vukmir on Election Day. Baldwin, he said, \"is representing Schumer and California.\" CBS News reporter covering the Senate.",

            "article_content": "President Trump is in Elko, Nevada, Saturday to rally for Sen. Dean Heller and other Republican candidates in the state. It's his third campaign rally in three days. He was met with an enthusiastic crowd who often interrupted his speech with cheers. Heller is facing Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen and is considered the most vulnerable Republican up for re-election in the Senate this year, as Hillary Clinton won Nevada in 2016. Mr. Trump has ramped up his campaign presence in the month before the midterm elections, urging large rally crowds to turn out to vote and ensure that Republicans keep the majority in Congress. He often spends much of his rallies condemning Democrats, accusing them of being a \"mob\" unfit to govern. He repeated this message at the rally in Elko Saturday, pointing out that early voting begins on Saturday in the state. \"The Democrat Party has become an angry, ruthless, unhinged mob determined to get power,\" Mr. Trump said. He repeated a new talking point he has unveiled in recent rallies, urging Republicans to vote for \"jobs, not mobs,\" adding that the so-called blue wave was being \"shattered.\" He asked rally goers to immediately go and vote. Mr. Trump also repeated some direct quotes from earlier this week. \"This will be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense,\" Mr. Trump said in Nevada, just as he did in Montana two days earlier, referring to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and a\u00a0caravan of migrants\u00a0from Honduras on their way to the American border. Mr. Trump brought Heller to the stage, joking beforehand about his initially frosty relationship with Heller. \"Once we understood each other...there's no better partner that I had in Washington,\" Mr. Trump said about Heller. In his speech to the crowd, Heller attacked Rosen, saying that she was only willing to campaign in Las Vegas, which trends Democratic. Mr. Trump also stumped for Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt during the rally, whom he brought to the stage at one point. Recent polls have shown a tight race between Laxalt and Democrat Steve Sisolak. Heller and Rosen met at their first and only debate on Friday, where the two traded barbs and interrupted each other often. Both candidates touted their bipartisanship, though when asked what could be done to ease political gridlock in Washington, Heller echoed Mr. Trump by blaming the media for divisiveness in the country. At one point, Mr. Trump solicited the audience on what nickname he should use for former Vice President Joe Biden, who visited Nevada to stump for Rosen on Saturday. He asked the crowd whether the nickname should be \"Sleepy Joe\" or \"1 percent Joe,\" due to his failed presidential attempts. Recent polls have shown the race between Heller and Rosen tightening. A recent\u00a0New York Times/Siena College poll\u00a0showed Heller two points ahead among likely voters. The CBS News Battleground Tracker rates the race as a \"toss up.\" Earlier in the day, Biden echoed Mr. Trump's talking points on the need to vote, albeit for politicians on the opposite side of the aisle, saying that \"you've never participated in an election as consequential\" as the one in November. Mr. Trump\u00a0visited Las Vegas\u00a0in October to rally for Heller and other statewide Republican candidates. The president criticized Rosen at the rally, calling her \"Wacky Jacky\" and saying that she would never vote with the president if elected to the Senate. Mr. Trump began his western campaign tour on Thursday, when he rallied in Montana in support for Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. Although Mr. Trump won Montana by 20 points, a September\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker poll\u00a0last month\u00a0showed Tester leading Rosendale by two points. The CBS News Battleground Tracker rates the race as \"Edge Democrat.\" Mr. Trump also focused heavily on illegal immigration in this rally. On Friday, Mr. Trump\u00a0rallied in Mesa, Arizona. He was promoting Republican Senate candidate Martha McSally, and spent much of the rally talking about undocumented immigrants, resurrecting the phrase \"bad hombres\" to describe criminals entering the country illegally.

            "article_content": "The two billionaire mega donors poured $1.25 million into a super PAC that was supposed to supercharge Chris McDaniel's insurgent bid to be Mississippi's next Republican senator. A year later, much of the money from Illinois shipping supply CEO Richard Uihlein and New York financier Robert Mercer is gone. Only a fraction was spent reaching voters who could boost the former state lawmaker's uphill battle against Cindy Hyde-Smith, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's preferred candidate in a November special election that will determine who finishes out retired GOP Sen. Thad Cochran's term. What the Remember Mississippi super PAC has provided, however, is a generous payday for at least 18 campaign consultants who received the lion's share of the money, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission records. Since a landmark 2010 Supreme Court ruling, much of the debate over super PACs has focused on how a wealthy cadre of donors can now give unlimited amounts, allowing them to play an outsized role in who gets elected. This case highlights how that money doesn't always get spent the way it's intended. \"It is part of the growing trend of people using super PACs to get wealthy, rather than to direct the funds they raise toward actual political activity,\" said Adav Noti, a former FEC attorney who now works for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington. Of the nearly $1.4 million raised by Remember Mississippi, about $265,000 went to expenses like video production, ads, graphic design and other forms of communication that either advocated for McDaniel or opposed his rivals, according to their latest FEC report at the end of June. Meanwhile, consultants and operating expenses soaked up nearly three times that, or $792,000. That leaves a little more than $300,000 ahead of the November special election. So far, Remember Mississippi has spent about $25,000 \u2014 with most of that dropped just last week \u2014 on airtime and ad production attacking Hyde-Smith, records show. But Hyde-Smith, a onetime Democrat who formerly served as the state's agriculture commissioner and was temporarily appointed to fill Cochran's Senate seat last April until the special election, has $1.3 million on hand, which is vastly more than either McDaniel or the super PAC. And Remember Mississippi hasn't had a major cash infusion since January, aside from a $25,000 donation from beer baron August A. Busch III. That puts McDaniel, who has just $156,000 in his own campaign fund, at a disadvantage. \"I don't think that's how the typical super PAC runs, but it's not unheard of,\" said Dan Weiner, a campaign finance attorney with New York University's Brennan Center. \"It's the Wild West. There's just very little law that applies.\" In an emailed statement, PAC leader Tommy Barnett justified the large amount spent on consultants, which he said produced \"a strong regional volunteer presence across Mississippi that has been putting up signs, passing out bumper stickers, and attending events engaging directly with voters.\" \"We will have funds to get out the radio, TV, and digital advertisements we already have produced,\" Barnett said. The PAC takes its name from the \"Remember Mississippi\" rallying cry McDaniel adopted after losing a bitterly fought primary against Cochran in 2014. McDaniel blamed Democrats \"illegally\" voting in the GOP contest and national Republicans spending \"millions of dollars to character assassinate one of their own,\" though the Mississippi Supreme Court rejected his lawsuit challenging the outcome. That race also took an unsavory twist after four of McDaniel's supporters were charged in connection with a plot to photograph Cochran's wife in her nursing home, where she had spent years suffering dementia. The men, one of whom was sentenced to 21/2 years in prison, had hoped to advance allegations Cochran was having an inappropriate relationship with a staffer while neglecting his wife. This year McDaniel, who was urged to run again by former White House counselor Steve Bannon, expected to challenge GOP Sen. Roger Wicker. But Cochran's retirement upended that. Now, due to special election quirks, he faces Hyde-Smith, as well as two Democrats on a wide-open special election ballot. Remember Mississippi has paid for social media and radio ads, though so far it has spent only about $5,500 on TV, according to Federal Communications Commission records. A YouTube page for the group includes several videos that have been viewed a handful of times. The sometimes-shaky footage captures McDaniel weighing in on red-meat conservative issues like immigration, national debt and taxes, which he said politicians use to \"waste or defraud\" voters. Some of the consultants and firms working for the group are well established, and at least one has ties to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential bid. Others are murkier and have a limited web presence. One consultant, Dan Tripp, who is running for Greenville County Council in South Carolina, advertises\u00a0free webinars\u00a0that promise to teach candidates how to \"Discover Your Campaign's Pathway to Victory Using Four Tried-And-True Strategies.\" Tripp, who has been paid about $112,000, did not respond to a request for comment. A number of consultants worked on McDaniel's 2014 campaign. Two, former Mississippi state Sen. Melanie Sojourner and Richard Burke, left the super PAC to join McDaniel's campaign. In March, McDaniel drew scrutiny over what appeared to be coordination between the group and his campaign, which is a violation of FEC rules. The Campaign Legal Center, the group that campaign finance attorney Noti works for, filed a\u00a0complaint\u00a0alleging Remember Mississippi made \"illegal, excessive and unreported\" contributions to McDaniel by paying for several catered events that were promoted as official campaign activities. McDaniel denied there was any coordination. \"There is none. Once I announced (my candidacy), I was not allowed to have any contact whatsoever,\" he said in an interview. Money donated by Mercer and Uihlein to support McDaniel is a drop in the bucket compared to their own fortunes. Uihlein, who contributed $750,000 to Remember Mississippi, has given more than $48 million to party committees and outside groups, like super PACs, according to the FEC. Mercer, who donated $500,000 to the super PAC, has given more than $39 million to such groups. Neither responded to requests for comment. Noti said the real issue is not whether the money was squandered, but the level of access it would buy if McDaniel wins. \"The fact that sometimes mega donors make poor decisions about where to invest their money doesn't change the fact that they are still buying outsized influence,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Even as primary season continues, several Senate races are taking shape, with some incumbent Republicans and several incumbent Democrats in danger of losing their seats. The \"blue wave\" may be coming for the House of Representatives, but it is less likely to crash over the Senate, where Democrats are likely to lose seats and widen the gap between the majority and the minority. Here is an updated look at Senate races to watch as November approaches. The race to replace departing Sen. Jeff Flake will put the theory that demographic changes are turning Arizona blue to the test.\u00a0 Phoenix-area Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, the likely Democratic nominee, has tried to carve a niche as a more moderate Democrat. According to FiveThirtyEight, Sinema votes in line with President Trump's policies around 60 percent of the time. She is also a member of Democrats' Blue Dog Coalition, a group of more moderate congressional Democrats. However, local Democrats see Sinema as the party's best chance of taking a still-red state. Three Republicans are vying to become the Republican candidate for Senate: Rep. Martha McSally, the choice of the party establishment, conservative firebrand Dr. Kelli Ward, and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio, who recently received a presidential pardon, will likely leech votes away from Ward, a former state senator who ran in the Republican primary against Sen. John McCain in 2016. Sinema would likely prefer to face a more extreme figure like Ward or Arpaio. However, McSally is the front-runner to win the nomination, making it less likely that moderates will flock to Sinema.\u00a0 Arizona's primary election is on August 28. Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is prevented from seeking a third term due to term limits, is challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in one of the country's most contentious races. State and national Democrats are concerned about the prospects of victory for Nelson, who has been in office since 2001.\u00a0 Scott raised $22 million in his first quarter as a candidate for Senate, with $8 million of those funds coming from individual contributions, while Nelson raised $4.4 million in the second quarter. Scott is also extremely wealthy, and could potentially pour millions of his own funds into his campaign in the final stretch of the race.\u00a0 Polling has shown the race to be close, with Scott leading Nelson by 3 percentage points in a CBS News poll\u00a0from July. Florida is one of the states where a loss would be devastating for Democrats, as it would widen the narrow gap between the current majority and minority in the Senate. Sen. Joe Donnelly is perhaps the most vulnerable Democrat in the Senate this election season. Donnelly is running for re-election in a state Mr. Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points. The Democrat has been nervously hewing to the center in recent months, denouncing recent progressive battle cries like implementing Medicare for All and abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\u00a0 Donnelly is facing a challenge from Mike Braun, a Republican business executive who sailed to his primary victory as an outsider candidate and spent $4.5 million in the final weeks of the race. Mr. Trump campaigned against Donnelly during a May rally in Elkhart, Indiana, calling the incumbent \"Sleepin' Joe.\" Meanwhile, Donnelly continues to steadfastly project an image as a moderate, and even Trump-friendly. In July, Donnelly released an ad that quotes Mr. Trump's praise of the senator at a bill signing later in May. In an age of hyper-partisanship, it's unclear whether Donnelly's tactics will be successful, or whether ruby-red Indiana will elect a Republican senator in November. Sen. Claire McCaskill is yet another endangered Democrat seeking re-election in a state Mr. Trump won by an overwhelming margin. McCaskill has lucked out in her Republican opponents in previous years; in 2012, the candidacy of Republican Todd Akin was tanked by his comment that \"legitimate rape\" could not result in pregnancy.\u00a0 McCaskill received another political godsend in 2018 thanks to the meltdown of the state Republican Party. GOP Gov. Eric Greitens, a conservative rising star, resigned earlier this year amid after being accused of blackmailing and assaulting a woman with whom he had had an affair.\u00a0 McCaskill's Republican opponent, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, has been criticized by some in his own party for being too distant, and not campaigning with sufficient vigor. McCaskill has also outraised Hawley, raking in over $4 million in donations during the second quarter, compared to Hawley's $1 million. Early polling has generally shown McCaskill ahead, although a poll from the Republican firm Remington Research in July showed Hawley edging out McCaskill by two percentage points. McCaskill has also recently been knocked by Hawley for using a private plane during a campaign tour. The November election will test McCaskill's luck, and her campaigning skills. Sen. Dean Heller is widely considered the most vulnerable senator in the majority and is the only Republican senator seeking re-election in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Although he avoided a potentially tricky primary with Mr. Trump's help, his close ties with the president and his agenda could be fatal to his campaign. In 2017, Heller co-sponsored a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which would have reportedly cost Nevada $250 million in federal health care funding. Heller said in August that Republicans made a \"big mistake\" by tackling Obamacare as their first major legislative move with Trump in office. The incumbent is facing Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, who was first elected in 2016 in a district that Mr. Trump won. However, Rosen lacks name recognition across the state. Early polling shows a tight race, with different polls showing either candidate ahead by one percentage point or less. Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is a major target for national Republicans, although she has a relatively close relationship with Mr. Trump for a Democrat. Heitkamp was considered for a cabinet position, and has sat next to the president at bill-signings and ridden on Air Force One. Mr. Trump once called her a \"good woman.\" Heitkamp released an ad touting her bipartisanship, noting that she voted over half the time in line with Mr. Trump's policies. Mr. Trump's chumminess with Heitkamp has evoked the annoyance of her Republican opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer, who has suggested that Mr. Trump was not targeting Heitkamp forcefully because of her gender. However, in a June rally, Mr. Trump went after Heitkamp, saying that she was liberal who voted in line with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0 Even with Trump's hot-and-cold behavior, Heitkamp is seriously vulnerable. Republican Sen. Bob Corker's departure has left Tennessee open to Democratic takeover. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the Republican candidate, is facing a challenge from former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a popular moderate Democrat. Bredesen is ahead of Blackburn in early polling. Blackburn is focusing her campaign on her support for Trump, who endorsed her in May. At a rally in Nashville in May, Mr. Trump portrayed Bredesen as a tool of \"Chuck and Nancy.\" Blackburn has promised to wholeheartedly support Mr. Trump's agenda if elected. Blackburn used clips from that rally in a recent campaign ad touting Trump's endorsement. Despite Blackburn's Trumpworld cred, the race remains competitive. Bredesen's campaign recently released an ad highlighting praise that he received from Republicans when he was governor. Blackburn is trying to make the election a referendum on Trump, a strategy which may not work in her favor. Smart money in Texas is not betting that Rep. Beto O'Rourke, the telegenic Democratic congressman from El Paso, will defeat Sen. Ted Cruz. However, despite Mr. Trump's nearly 10-point margin of victory in 2016 and Cruz winning by 16 percentage points in 2012, the buzz around O'Rourke is loud enough to suggest that the conservative incumbent may be in trouble.\u00a0 O'Rourke's tour of the state has garnered large crowds nearly everywhere he goes. He has also raised $10 million in the second quarter, compared to Cruz's $4 million. The Cook Political Report has even rated the Texas Senate race as \"lean Republican,\" which means they don't believe it is a lock for Cruz.\u00a0 Nonetheless, O'Rourke is a long shot. No Democrat has been elected statewide in Texas in 20 years. As in Arizona, O'Rourke's candidacy is a test of how much demographic changes have shifted a solid Republican state to the left, and whether it's enough to elect a Democrat. Sen. Joe Manchin is an endangered species: the last statewide Democrat standing in West Virginia, which voted for Mr. Trump by over 40 percentage points. If anywhere can truly be defined as \"Trump country,\" it is West Virginia, where formerly Democratic Gov. Jim Justice switched to the Republican Party in 2017 at a rally Mr. Trump. Manchin has made his reputation as a conservative Democrat, voting to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in 2017 and Gina Haspel as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2018. He is a major target of Republican efforts to get vulnerable Democrats to vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Manchin hasn't ruled out voting for Mr. Trump in 2020. His willingness to embrace Mr. Trump may be enough to save Manchin, who is facing Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the general election. Recent polling has shown Manchin to be several points ahead of Morrisey. However, if Republicans - with the help of Trump - are successfully able to portray Manchin as just another Democrat, that lead could narrow very quickly. It's unlikely that Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez is going to lose his re-election effort in New Jersey in November, but it is not outside the realm of possibility. After a hung jury was unable to come to a verdict on federal corruption-related charges, the government dropped the case against Menendez, but the specter of his alleged misdeeds overshadows his campaign.\u00a0 Menendez won his primary with only 62 percent of the vote against a primary candidate who barely campaigned. Menendez will probably prevail against Republican Bob Hugin, but the margin of victory may be smaller than expected, depending on how many people cast a protest vote. Hugin has also injected over $15 million in his own campaign. Democratic Sen. Doug Jones' victory Alabama proved that the Deep South is indeed vulnerable to a blue wave. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith was appointed to replace Sen. Thad Cochran in April, and is now trying to win a December special election. She facing a challenge from the right from conservative state Sen. Chris McDaniel. Democrat Mike Espy, a former congressman and secretary of agriculture under President Bill Clinton, is also in the race. If no candidate gets a majority of votes, there will be a runoff election between the top two candidates. Espy's path to victory is surprisingly plausible: if Espy and McDaniel are the top two candidates, Mississippians may choose the moderate Democrat over the conservative provocateur. California's Senate seat will definitely remain in Democratic hands. Incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein overwhelmingly won her primary against state Sen. Kevin De Leon, who challenged Feinstein from the left. However, Feinstein and De Leon are both on the November ballot, due to California's practice of advancing the top two vote-getters in a primary, regardless of party.\u00a0 Despite decisively losing the primary, De Leon was endorsed by state Democratic Party, and some progressives in the state hope that he can ride an insurgent campaign to victory over the 85-year-old incumbent.

There are candidates in every non-judicial race, and compared with four years ago, requests for mail-in ballots have increased. \"The county election department sent out 95 mail-in ballots to people voting in the [previous] Democratic primary,\" Smith said. \"As of last week, there were 2,300 out and that number is over 3,000 now.\" Dallas County GOP chairwoman Missey Shorey said Republicans, too, are enthusiastic about 2018. \"We respect what's going on on the left and that is something that is really waking up our activists,\" Shorey said.\u00a0 Shorey said the Republican National Committee and Republican party of Texas are sending reinforcements here because they say Democrats are targeting the area. Vice President Pence's appearance at their Reagan Day dinner this past weekend led to record fundraising -- $800,000 from the event, with 1,400 people in attendance. Shorey said Republicans are energized about tax cuts and the debate over immigration. \"That's why you're seeing record attendance at the Reagan Day dinner, that's why you're seeing record turnout in terms of precinct chairs in recent history and that's why you're seeing people ready to get involved, whether it be block-walking, using phones, using cutting-edge apps,\" she said.\u00a0 Southern Methodist University political science professor Cal Jillson predicts the excitement about various political races will boost turnout of the primary to 35 percent or more, up from from less than a third of eligible voters during a typical non-presidential year. \"I think it's going to be higher this time. There's a lot of energy out there. A lot of it is on the Democratic side, so the Republicans have to keep pace,\" Jillson said.\u00a0 Jillson said President Trump has galvanized Democrats nationwide and in Texas, where Republicans remain the majority party. \"In a primary election, the Republican turnout is usually higher than the Democratic turnout,\" Jillson said. \"If the Democrats are even with Republicans, even surpass them, that foretells a good year for Democrats.\" Early voting begins Tuesday, Feb. 20 and continues through March 2. Then polling places will be open for Election Day on Tuesday, March 6.",

            "article_content": "DENVER \u00a0\u2014 Colorado is joining a growing list of states that allow unaffiliated voters \u2014 the state's largest voting bloc \u2014 to participate in the major party primaries, thanks to a voter-passed initiative that coincided with disenchantment with the polarization of the 2016 election. The 2016 initiative allows Colorado's 1.2 million active independent voters to cast ballots Tuesday in either the Democratic or Republican party primaries on Tuesday. The initiative passed in a year that saw presidential candidate Bernie Sanders defeat Hillary Clinton in Colorado caucuses and yet a strong vote for Donald Trump in the general election, though he lost the state. Early mail and drop-off ballot returns suggest that more independents are voting Democratic in a tight gubernatorial primary to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper. It's too early to predict independents' turnout or impact on the campaigns, advocates said. \"What this means for the races will take time to see,\" said Josh Penry, a political consultant and former Republican state Senate minority leader who campaigned for the initiative. \"As the parties self-immolate and people flee them, it's important that they can vote in the semi-finals.\" \"The reality is the GOP and the Democrats should be thinking about how to appeal to the people in this enormous bloc,\" Penry said. But there's little sign that the major party gubernatorial candidates are reaching out in this swing state where Democrats and Republicans each have roughly 1 million registered voters. Presumed Democratic front-runners U.S. Rep. Jared Polis and former state Treasurer Cary Kennedy espouse universal health care, their public schools credentials, protecting public lands and promoting renewable energy. Republicans, including Treasurer Walker Stapleton, a cousin of President George W. Bush, generally embrace President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and income tax cuts and promote Colorado's oil and gas industry. It's that polar opposite, take-it-or-leave-it campaign buffet that prompted Alex Leith, a Denver civil engineer, to abandon the Democratic Party and become an unaffiliated voter two years ago. He saw the Sanders and Trump rebellions as signs that traditional party politics weren't working for people like himself, a self-described fiscal conservative and social liberal. \"I was seeing a lot of hypocrisy coming from Republicans and Democrats,\" Leith said. \"I wanted to see a return to a common sense ability to actually govern and work across party lines.\" The 27-year-old cast his gubernatorial primary ballot this year for Republican businessman and former state Rep. Victor Mitchell. \"He's willing to not totally align himself with Republican dogma,\" Leith said, citing Mitchell's support for a \"red flag\" law that would allow the seizure of firearms from those who pose a danger to themselves or others. \"I'm also encouraged by the fact that he's willing to admit when he isn't knowledgeable about certain topics \u2014 but is willing to study them,\" Leith said. Supporters of the semi-open primary argue that independent voters like Leith pay for the party primaries and should have a say in them. Whether that generates higher turnout or moderate candidate positions could take several election cycles to determine. Arizona, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island and West Virginia also allow independents to vote in primaries. As of early Thursday, nearly 540,000 Coloradans had voted \u2014 including nearly 123,000 independents. Democrats and Republicans had returned about 208,000 ballots for each party. In 2016, 21 percent of active voters participated in the primary. \"Our data and our experience points to how philosophically diverse Colorado is. There is no such thing as a generic independent,\" said Kent Thiry, the CEO of Denver-based dialysis firm DaVita Inc., who spearheaded the 2016 initiative. \"I've been an independent most of my adult life,\" Thiry said. \"To not have a voice until the final election in a country where the primary has become the final election ... that is very frustrating to me.\" Thiry's group released a poll this week suggesting that education, health care, jobs and the economy are the top issues for Colorado's unaffiliated voters. Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, is skeptical that the new system will produce an immediate impact. \"A lot of states allow some version of this, and honestly the research suggests it doesn't make that much of a difference whether (the primary) is open or closed,\" Masket said. \"The nominees end up looking like the one the parties would choose themselves.\" Also running to succeed Hickenlooper are former Democratic state Sen. Mike Johnston and Democratic Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne. Republican businessman Greg Lopez and investment banker Doug Robinson, a nephew of Utah senate candidate Mitt Romney, want their party's nomination. Colorado hasn't elected a Republican governor since 1998.",

            "article_content": "Indian Wells, Calif. \u2014\u00a0The network backed by Charles and David Koch realizes 2018 will be a challenging environment \u2014 and they're going \"all in\" to defend their policy priorities and candidates who support them, to the likely tune of roughly $400 million. That would be likely the largest investment the Koch network \u2014 the affiliated groups backed by the brothers and donors \u2014 has ever had in a midterm election, and significantly more than the roughly $250 million they spent during the 2016 presidential cycle.\u00a0   Last summer, the Koch brothers' political network projected it would spend $300 to $400 million\u00a0on politics and policy in the election, but now, spending will be on the \"high end\" of that. \"So we're all in,\" said Tim Phillips, the president of the network's political advocacy arm Americans for Prosperity, at a gathering of the Koch-affiliated Seminar Network in Indian Wells, Calif., Saturday.\u00a0 Allies of the network \u2014 about 700 of them \u2014 are meeting this weekend to discuss the intersection of policy, politics and philanthropy in 2018 and beyond. The tone of leaders in the Koch network Saturday, the first day of the three-day gathering, was one of optimism, coming off of what Phillips described as perhaps the most effective policy year yet. They count reforms in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the nomination of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, and \u2014 perhaps most of all \u2014 tax reform as significant, long-lasting accomplishments in Washington, D.C. But there's no denying that history and polling don't favor Republicans, the party with which the Kochs have generally aligned themselves. According to Real Clear Politics, Democrats, on the generic House ballot, Democrats beat Republicans by about 8 points, as of polls aggregated between Jan. 8 and Jan. 23. Historically, midterm elections don't favor the party in power, as Phillips was quick to highlight. Elections in Virginia and elsewhere have revealed momentum for Democrats.\u00a0 \"The left is energized, there's no question about that,\" Phillips said.\u00a0 The financial support comes, coincidentally, as the Republican National Committee loses finance chair Steve Wynn, who resigned after the Wall Street Journal reported alleged extensive sexual misconduct. Wynn, a casino mogul, was a major backer of Republican candidates.\u00a0 The unspoken aspect of the challenging 2018 environment is President Trump, who continues to struggle with approval ratings lower than his recent predecessors at this point in their presidencies. The Koch brothers themselves declined to spend anything on the 2016 presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. But that tone seems to have shifted since the 2016 election, and Koch-related entities are finding ways to work with the Trump administration. Marc Short, for instance, the White House's director of legislative affairs, previously worked in Koch world, at Freedom Partners.\u00a0 Now, they want to protect what they consider significant accomplishments in the administration, and work to further them.\u00a0 Part of that includes an infusion of up to $20 million on selling tax reform to the public \u2014 after already spending $20 million on passing the legislation Mr. Trump signed into law at the end of last year.\u00a0 Other than that, much of their spending strategy in 2018 has yet to be seen. But, it likely won't be focused on the upcoming primary races.\u00a0 \"Historically, we have not gotten involved with primaries,\" Phillips said. Leaders in the Koch network on Saturday were hesitant to share what specific requirements they might have for backing candidates, on immigration or any other policy area. The Seminar Network on Saturday issued a statement Saturday supporting the White House's proposal for a path to citizenship for young immigrants, but expressed concern over the proposal to end extended family-based migration.\u00a0 \"If you're not a champion, it's going to be hard to support you,\" said James Davis, president of In Pursuit Of, the relatively new public relations arm affiliated with the Koch network.\u00a0 \"We're going to be there for our champions, and that's what we've consistently said and done.\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Millions of Americans are heading to the polls Tuesday to cast their ballots in 435 House seats, 35 Senate races and 36 gubernatorial contests. While exit polls may give insight into how people are voting, social media and Google searches also offer some clues about which candidates and issues were getting the most attention online leading up to the midterms. Analysis by\u00a0The New York Times found that overall, Democratic candidates have more Facebook shares, likes, and comments. But in five out of nine toss-up Senate races, the Republican candidates have seen higher interactions on Facebook over the past 30 days. For example, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn had more interactions than her Democratic opponent, Phil Bredesen. In the Florida Senate race, Democrat Bill Nelson had more Facebook interactions over 30 days than his Republican opponent, Rick Scott. The race with the most Facebook interactions overall: the Texas Senate contest between\u00a0Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democrat Beto O'Rourke. Cruz saw 820,000 interactions over the past 30 days and O'Rourke saw even more, 1.6 million over the past 30 days. Gubernatorial races were more evenly divided it comes to Facebook. Out of the 10 gubernatorial races The New York Times measured on Facebook, five Republican candidates had more Facebook interactions than their opponents, while in five other races the Democrats came out on top. Over the past month, certain candidates have opened up wide leads over their opponents -- at least when it comes to Google searches. In Georgia, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has trended higher on Google than Republican Brian Kemp for the past 30 days. A similar trend is seen in Florida, where there have been more Google searches for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum than for Republican Ron DeSantis over the past 30 days.\u00a0 In other races, however, Google search trends can change day by day. Such is the case when comparing Texas senatorial candidates Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke, who have both gotten their fair share of searches for the past month.\u00a0 The Google Trends graph comparing California congressional candidates Rep. Dana Rohrabacher and Democratic businessman Harley Rouda, also shows searches for each candidate fluctuating over the past 30 days, and nearly tied by Election Day. Breaking down Google searches by state shows that over the past week, people in each state have tended to search more for one candidate than the other. Abrams has seen higher search interest in her home state of Georgia, compared to Kemp. Gillum has seen a higher search interest in almost every Florida county. Only one county tended to search for DeSantis more. Texas appears to have a higher search interest in incumbent Cruz than opponent O'Rourke. The amount of interest in common political issues has been shifting over the past week. As of noon on Election Day, the issue receiving the most interest is health care, Google Trends data shows. This is followed by immigration, abortion, Social Security and minimum wage, in that order.\u00a0 Google Trends has an interactive graphic that shows the interest in these issues shifting over time. Twitter, of course, is President Trump's favorite social media platform, but candidates' Twitter followings are determined by several factors and may not always reflect their popularity among voters. How long they've had their Twitter account, for example, may affect how many followers they've accumulated over time.\u00a0 Out of the high-profile races in Georgia, Florida and Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz is the candidate with the most Twitter followers, coming in at 3.25 million. His opponent, Beto O'Rourke, has the second-highest number with about 756,000. It's worth noting that some of those followers on both sides might not actually be supporters; some people use Twitter to keep tabs on the opposition, and many journalists follow tweets from candidates of both parties all over the country. Trending topics on Twitter can give insight into what people are talking about on Election Day. Nationwide, U.S. trending topics on November 6 didn't include any candidates' names, but rather different variations of election day hashtags. #IVoted, #MidtermElections208, #GoVote and #ElectionDay were all trending.

            "article_content": "Voters went to the polls Tuesday in primary contests in four states: Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Idaho and Oregon. \"Our right to vote is so critical, especially in these really challenging times,\" voter Elaine Petrossian told CBS Philadelphia. Here are the results as they are coming in: Pennsylvania is a must-win state for Democrats if they want to take back the House, CBS Pittsburgh money and politics editor Jon Delano told CBSN Tuesday. President Trump turned the state red in 2016 and it has for years been overwhelmingly Republican in the House, but new districts have Democrats hopeful the state is in play. Four-term U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump who first got national notice as a small-city mayor for his attempted crackdown on illegal immigration, on Tuesday won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Barletta had paid little attention to his Republican rival, state Rep. Jim Christiana, during the primary campaign. Instead, he focused his attacks on the candidate he hopes to unseat in the fall, two-term Democratic Sen. Bob Casey.\u00a0 Barletta is a favorite of Mr. Trump, whom Barletta endorsed in 2016. Mr. Trump asked Barletta to run for Senate, and the president is expected to visit Pennsylvania to campaign for him.  Casey, who was unopposed for the Democratic nomination, has opposed Mr. Trump's Supreme Court pick, many of his highest-profile nominees and the GOP tax-cutting law. He is among 10 Democratic senators seeking re-election this year in states won by Mr. Trump, making Casey a target for Republicans.  Mr. Trump edged Democrat Hillary Clinton by less than 1 percentage point in Pennsylvania in 2016's presidential election. Republicans control the Senate, 51-49, and defeating Casey would give Republicans one more vote favorable to Mr. Trump to help advance the president's agenda. But it is a tall order.  Casey, the son of a late former governor, has strong name recognition and has won five statewide elections, including two as auditor general and one as state treasurer. He also has a huge cash advantage, with about $10 million in the bank at the end of April, compared with Barletta's $1.3 million.  Casey, 58, is popular with labor unions and backed former President Barack Obama's signature policies.  Barletta, 62, won his House seat during the Republican midterm wave of 2010, catapulted by the attention he received while mayor of Hazleton for attempting to use local laws to crack down on immigrants in the city who had entered the country illegally. \u00a0 In the gubernatorial race, Pennsylvania state Sen. Scott Wagner will run against Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf after winning the GOP primary, CBS Philadelphia reports. Wagner defeated two first-time candidates from the Pittsburgh area, Paul Mango and Laura Ellsworth, surviving weeks of Mango's sharp-elbowed attack ads that painted Wagner as sleazy, greedy and a \"deadbeat dad.\" \u00a0 Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor has become the first holder of the office to lose in a primary election. John Fetterman won the five-way Democratic Party primary race for lieutenant governor Tuesday, beating incumbent Mike Stack. The Braddock mayor's victory means he will run on a ticket with Gov. Tom Wolf in the fall. Pennsylvania first started allowing lieutenant governors to serve a second term in the 1970s. Fetterman had made a failed bid in 2016 for the U.S. Senate. Fetterman -- \"America's Coolest Mayor\" -- was profiled by CBS News' Jeff Glor for \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010.\u00a0 Stack, a former Philadelphia state senator, has had a chilly relationship with Wolf in their first term together. Wolf last year ordered an investigation into the treatment of state employees by Stack and his wife and stripped Stack of state police protection. For the candidates battling for congressional seats, they will all be chosen, for the first time, based on a new congressional map that the state Supreme Court said corrects GOP gerrymandering. Two local incumbent House Democrats from Pennsylvania have turned back primary challenges.\u00a0 Dwight Evans, in his first full term, will face Republican Bryan Leib in the November general election. Brendan Boyle will face Republican David Torres. Evans and Boyle represent heavily Democratic districts in Philadelphia.\u00a0 \"I think it's great that we are finally doing something about gerrymandering and I hope this makes more people go out and vote because their votes actually count now,\" said Diane Dalto. It's still early and unclear if the new map is affecting voter turnout, but it has created some interesting races. Several incumbent candidates who are seeking re-election, like Congressman Dwight Evans, have to fight for re-election in a new district because of the new map. Evans will still likely regain his seat, but under the new map, analysts say some Republican seats may be up for grabs. \"I'm hoping to see the tide swing,\" said Karren Knowlton.\u00a0 Lincoln City Councilwoman Jane Raybould won the Democratic primary to try and unseat Republican Sen. Deb Fischer, a tough prospect in overwhelmingly conservative Nebraska. Raybould, who ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2014, helps run a Nebraska grocery store chain founded by her late father. She was the best-financed Democrat in the race.  The other Democrats were Frank Svoboda, a retired farmer, attorney and judge from Lincoln; Larry Marvin, a retired real estate broker from Fremont; and Chris Janicek, of Omaha, who owns a specialty cake business.  Fischer easily defeated four GOP primary challengers and enjoys a substantial fundraising advantage and statewide name recognition. Her primary challengers were Jack Heidel, a retired math professor from Omaha; Dennis Frank Macek, a writer and retired air conditioning technician from Lincoln; Jeffrey Lynn Stein, a professional photographer from Omaha; and Lincoln businessman Todd Watson.  Libertarian Jim Schultz ran unopposed for his party's nomination.  In the gubernatorial race, Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts handily won the party's nomination to seek a second four-year term. He now faces state Sen. Bob Krist of Omaha, a former Republican and independent who joined the Democratic Party in February. Krist has pitched himself as a less partisan alternative to Ricketts who would work more collaboratively with the Legislature.  Ricketts ran against Krystal Gabel of Omaha, a registered Republican who has volunteered to create the Legal Marijuana Now Party of Nebraska.  Democrats Vanessa Gayle Ward, an Omaha community activist, and University of Nebraska at Omaha instructor Tyler Davis were also seeking the nomination in their first bids for public office.  Former state Sen. Russ Fulcher on Tuesday won the Idaho Republican crowded and competitive primary in the 1st Congressional District.  \"It is an honor folks. Because when you invest your faith - in me, in this case - to represent you, every time I say a word, every time I cast a vote, I want you to know I take that very, very seriously,\" Fulcher said during his victory speech in Boise. \"We're here because we have the same faith. We're here because we have the same Republican principals.\"  The district, whose voters strongly backed President Trump in 2016, is being vacated by Republican Congressman Raul Labrador, who unsuccessfully ran for Idaho governor rather than run for re-election.  The 56-year-old Fulcher originally filed to run for Idaho's open gubernatorial seat nearly a year ago. Fulcher instead jumped into the congressional race, reasoning that he and Labrador should serve in complimentary roles.  Fulcher failed to win the GOP gubernatorial primary in 2014 with a narrow loss to Gov. C.L. \"Butch\" Otter.  Fulcher beat six other Republicans in Tuesday's primary, gaining 43 percent of the GOP primary vote in early returns with more than two-thirds of precincts reporting. His opponents included former Lt. Gov. and former Attorney General David Leroy, first-time candidate Michael Snyder and state Reps. Luke Malek and Christy Perry.  He will face Democrat Cristina McNeil in the November general election.\u00a0 Meanwhile, when former state Rep. Paulette Jordan, 38, won her primary, she became the first woman to be the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Idaho. If she wins the general election, Jordan, a member of the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, would not only be the first woman to serve as Idaho governor but also the first Native American woman to serve in that position in any state.  But she faces a difficult race: Idaho hasn't elected a Democratic governor since 1990, and the Republican Party now controls a supermajority on all federal, state and legislative seats.  Lt. Gov. Brad Little, 64, a rancher who has spent the past 16 years in elected office, secured the GOP nomination. He's the pick of Republican Gov. C.L. \"Butch\" Otter, who decided not to seek a fourth term.\u00a0 State Rep. Knute Buehler has emerged from a crowded primary to capture the Republican nomination for Oregon governor.  Buehler, who ran for secretary of state in 2012, was the most centrist of the Republican front-runners. He was among 10 GOP candidates in the primary.  However, Democratic Gov. Kate Brown remains the favorite to win in November. Brown became governor in 2015 upon the resignation of Gov. John Kitzhaber following an ethics scandal, and she won a special election in 2016.  Oregon is among eight states where Democrats control the governorship and both houses of the state legislature. Voters who identify as Democrats also outnumber their Republican counterparts by more than 9 percentage points.\u00a0",

He's largely going to states he won, where Democratic Senate incumbents are trying to fend off challenges from Republicans. The president's campaign, Parscale told \"CBS This Morning,\" is targeting two different groups in the week leading up to the midterm elections. \"The president's base, which I call the army of Trump -- he's going to fight for them to show up.

            "article_content": "Grace Segers contributed to this report. At their first and only Senate debate Friday, Republican Sen. Dean Heller accused his Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen, of using a visit to see separated families at the southern border as a \"photo-op.\" Rosen described Heller as \"rubber stamp\" for President Trump's tax cut during their Friday evening debate. Heller is considered to be vulnerable, since he's the only Republican senator up for re-election this year in a state which Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Heller and Rosen traded accusations of untruthfulness, and interrupted each other throughout their debate Friday night.\u00a0 Heller is considered the most vulnerable GOP senator running for re-election this year because he's the only Republican senator running in a state that Democrat Hillary Clinton won. The hourlong Friday night debate on KLAS-TV, KTVN-TV and C-SPAN brought the candidates together hours before early voting starts Saturday morning.\u00a0\u00a0 Democrats are hoping a backlash to Mr. Trump will propel their base to the polls and carry Rosen to victory in battleground Nevada. Both candidates touted their ability to work across the aisle, though when asked what could be done to ease a partisan standoff in Washington, Heller took a page from Mr. Trump's playbook by blaming the media for political divisiveness.  \"We have seen how they treat Trump supporters. We have seen how they treat Kanye West when he goes into the White House,\" Heller said. He didn't elaborate.  Heller and Rosen ramped up their criticisms as they discussed immigration, a key issue in a state with a 29 percent Latino population.  Rosen, who made a trip to visit U.S. border detention facilities in June, called the Trump administration's separation of migrant families reckless. Images of Rosen's visit later appeared in one of her campaign ads, leading Heller on Friday to accuse of missing her work in Washington to film a commercial.  \"I went down there to check on children,\" she interrupted. \"I was doing my job.\"  \"Do I get a chance to talk?\" Heller asked.  Despite the swipes, Heller and Rosen smiled throughout and at times asked questions of each other.  Heller criticized Rosen's vote against the GOP tax plan passed last year and highlighted her later appearance at a news conference that called for a repeal of the tax cut.  \"I voted for our strong economy. She voted against it,\" Heller said.  Rosen told reporters after the debate Friday that she would not vote to repeal the tax law but that she would like to make its middle-class tax cuts permanent.  Heller answered questions from KLAS after the debate but left the building before answering post-debate questions from other reporters who gathered to cover the event.\u00a0 Heller's campaign spokesman Keith Schipper said later that the candidate had to leave to get to Elko, where Mr. Trump is holding a rally Saturday.  At a KLAS focus group of undecided voters after the debate, participants were mainly along party lines. Independents viewed Rosen's remarks on border policy favorably, while they also reacted in favor to Heller pushing for increased care for U.S. veterans, KLAS reports. \u00a0 \u00a0 Rosen is reporting she collected an eye-popping $5 million in campaign donations during the first 17 days of October. On Friday, she announced her fundraising totals for the last campaign finance reporting period before the Nov. 6 election. The freshman congresswoman has outraised Heller every quarter since jumping into the race. Heller's campaign did not immediately respond to a message inquiring if his fundraising totals were available early as well. The reports are not due until Oct. 25. Heller has closely tied himself to President Trump throughout the campaign. He described himself as \"99 percent\" against Mr. Trump before the 2016 election, and Mr. Trump threatened to support a primary candidate against Heller in early 2017. However, facing the threat of a primary, Heller became a prominent supporter of the president in the past year. Although he initially opposed the repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act, Heller then hopped on board, supporting an amendment which would have seriously constricted Medicaid access. Rosen is a first-term congresswoman and a former synagogue president representing southern Nevada and the suburbs around Las Vegas. She has made health care a centerpiece of her campaign, and has repeatedly hit Heller for voting to repeal and replace the ACA. She is vacating her congressional seat to run for Senate, and the open seat is competitive. The CBS News Battleground Tracker rates Rosen's congressional district as \"Lean Democratic.\" Recent polls have shown the race between Heller and Rosen tightening. Although a CNN poll from early October showed Rosen leading among likely voters 47 percent to 43 percent, an NBC News/Marist poll released the following week showed Heller leading Rosen among likely voters 46 percent to 44 percent. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll also showed Heller two points ahead among likely voters. The CBS News Battleground Tracker rates the race as a \"toss up.\" Mr. Trump visited Las Vegas earlier in October to rally for Heller and other statewide Republican candidates. The president criticized Rosen at the rally, saying that she would never vote with the president if elected to the Senate. \"Remember this: Dean's Democrat opponent -- Wacky Jacky -- she doesn't get it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"She's going to do whatever Pelosi and Schumer tell her to do,\" he said, referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.",

            "article_content": "President Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, will attend a military parade commemorating Ukraine's Independence Day on Friday, one day after he met in Geneva for what were apparently tense talks with his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev. \u00a0 Bolton will also meet on Friday with Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman before holding a press conference, an NSC official said. Top American officials have traditionally participated in the annual ceremonies as a show of U.S. support for Ukraine, which this year celebrates its 27th year of independence from the Soviet Union. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the country for its celebrations last year and used the occasion to publicly warn Moscow about its military incursions into Ukrainian territory. \u00a0 Bolton's visit to Kiev comes on the heels of a five-hour meeting in Geneva with Russia's Patrushev that Bolton said resulted in \"considerable progress.\" The meeting nonetheless failed to produce a joint statement due to a disagreement about election meddling, which Bolton said he felt was \"important to mention\" and raised \"a number of times.\" \"We weren't able to reach agreement on that,\" Bolton said. In his remarks, Bolton offered what have been scarce details about the issues discussed by President Trump during his two-hour, one-on-one meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin last month. The fact of his meeting with Patrushev was, Bolton said, one item the presidents had agreed to in their discussion, as part of an effort to work toward restoring diplomatic and other exchanges. \"That was really the broad objective,\" he said, \"we had to take the discussion that the leaders had and try and spread it out and make it more specific and find concrete ways to proceed.\" Bolton said he and his counterpart covered an array of topics, including nuclear nonproliferation, arms control, counterterrorism, illegal immigration, cyber-related issues, and \"regional issues\" including Syria, the broader Middle East, Afghanistan, and Ukraine. On the issue of arms control \u2013 a priority stressed by Moscow since the Helsinki summit \u2013 Bolton was inconclusive, telling reporters there were \"a number of possibilities\" that the United States would need to consider before committing to take any action on an existing nuclear arms reduction treaty called New Start. \"We are very, very early in the process of considering what we are going to do,\" Bolton said. \u00a0\u00a0 He was less equivocal on the issue of election meddling. \"I made it clear that we wouldn't tolerate meddling in 2018 and that we were prepared to take necessary steps to prevent it from happening,\" he said. It was a statement that has not yet been delivered with an equivalent level of clarity from President Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on Moscow's involvement in 2016 election interference. The president has instead often allowed for the possibility that other, usually unnamed, actors carried out an influence campaign, although the U.S. intelligence community concluded with high confidence last year that the Russian government, as ordered by Putin, aimed to help then-candidate Trump's electability while damaging the chances of Hillary Clinton. In an interview he gave as recently as this week, Trump, decrying the ongoing special counsel probe into connections between his presidential campaign and Russia, said the investigation \"played right into the Russians' \u2013 if it was Russia \u2013 they played right into the Russians' hands.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Women are not just running for office in record numbers this year \u2014 they are winning. More women than ever before have won major party primaries for governor, U.S. Senate and House this year \u2014 paving the way for November battles that could significantly increase the number of women in elected office and change the public debate on issues such as health care, immigration, abortion rights, education and gun control. Some of these candidates could also play a pivotal role in whether Democrats are able to take control of the U.S. House. A new CBS News poll found that as record numbers of women throw their hat in the political ring, women voters in battleground congressional districts are five times as likely to say they would choose a woman candidate (28%) over a man (5%) if both candidates agreed with them on policy and party. Men say they would choose a woman over a man as well, although by a smaller margin. Still, a majority of voters \u2013 both men and women \u2013 say a candidate's gender wouldn't matter. Democratic women (42%) are about three times as likely as Republican women (15%) to say they would choose the woman candidate in a race where both the man and the women shared their views. Most of these female hopefuls are Democrats, some of whom are first-time candidates who say their motivation to run sprang from President Donald Trump's election and Republican control of Congress. But other developments factor in, too. The #MeToo movement. Women's marches. Trump's nomination of conservative appeals court Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that many women were running for office out of \"protest.\" \"Protest, anger, frustration and determination to protect their families,\" she explained.\u00a0 Gillibrand added, \"The fact that Donald Trump has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual assault and sexual harassment alone has infuriated women enough to do something that they might otherwise have not done. Taking the risk to actually run for office.\" \"Part of the reason I thought this race was possible, even despite great odds, was because of all the women who are so engaged in my community in a new way,\" said Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot and federal prosecutor who looks to capture a GOP congressional seat in New Jersey. Sherrill is one of some 200 women who have won their primaries for U.S. House, with 94 of these candidates surviving crowded fields with three or more candidates, according to an analysis of election results. Previously, the most women who had advanced were 167 in 2016, according to records kept by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. In the Senate, a record 19 women have won their primaries. And for the first time, 13 women have been nominated for gubernatorial races in a single election year. And all these numbers are likely to grow with nine states yet to hold their primaries. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo and U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham of Florida are among nine women running for governor who will face primary voters in coming weeks. No more than nine women have ever led states at the same time. \"We are seeing a level of enthusiasm among women voters that we haven't seen in a long time,\" said Democrat Laura Kelly, who is running for governor in Kansas and will need women, independents and moderate Republicans in her bid against Republican Kris Kobach. There are few instances in which women \u2014 in a sense \u2014 have already won. For instance, two women will be competing to replace GOP Rep. Steve Pearce in New Mexico and the same is happening in races in Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Michigan. But overall gains will also be dependent on how well the 71 congresswomen running for re-election fare in November. Success in November will go a long way to improving the nation's dismal record of female representation. Currently, women account for just a fifth of 535 U.S. representatives and senators, and one in four state lawmakers. Six of the nation's 50 governors are female. Meanwhile, women comprise slightly more than half the U.S. population. Women appear to be running strong so far. As of mid-August, some 49 percent of women running for the House have advanced to the general election, with about 40 percent in the Senate and about 25 percent running for governor, according to an analysis of election results. But that's no guarantee of victory this fall. Many of the women, particularly Democrats, are running in long-held Republican congressional districts or states where Republicans have consolidated support. One thing women have accomplished already is changing the tone and content of campaigns. They bring their children to rallies and some want their campaign money to pay for child care so they can run. On this count, Liuba Grechen Shirley, the Democratic candidate challenger to Republican Rep. Peter King, has succeeded. In May, the Federal Election Commission voted unanimously to allow the expenditure. \"I was told that with two kids, a husband who worked full time and no child care, that it was impossible,\" Grechen Shirley says in an online ad, noting her effort to change the policy. \"Well, it wasn't impossible. It's just really hard.\" Experienced combat veterans running for Congress this year are featuring their families in their ads as they speak with authority on national security and foreign policy. \"The old model is a little bit like trying to fit women into the mold of male candidates,\" said Deborah Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \"Women had a very narrow path that they could navigate as candidates: What was appropriate to wear, what was appropriate to say. They also were asked: If you win, who is going to take care of your children? This is not a question that men are confronted with.\" Beyond gender, these women are poised to usher in a wave of diversity next year. Michigan will likely send the nation's first Muslim-American woman to Congress, after Rashida Tlaib beat a crowded field of Democrats for the 13th Congressional District. No Republican is running in November for the heavily Democratic seat. There are nearly 50 black women running for Congress this year, from Democrat Lucy McBath who is challenging GOP Rep. Karen Handel in Georgia to Republican Rep. Mia Love's bid for a third term in Utah. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams is aiming to become the nation's first black female governor while Paulette Jordan would be the first Native American governor in U.S. history if she wins her race in Idaho. And Democratic voters in Vermont recently selected Christine Hallquist as their nominee, making her the first transgender candidate to win a major-party gubernatorial nomination. Black women are competing \u2014 and winning \u2014 not only in districts with a majority black electorate, but also in diverse districts across the country. Each victory is a vote of confidence in their leadership for those who step up, said Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights for America, which supports black female candidates and galvanizes black women as voters. \"In addition to black women wanting to be part of history, people are realizing that regardless of what you look like, the leadership of the country has been predominantly white and male for far too long,\" Peeler-Allen said. \"Seeing the value of having diverse voices around decision-making tables is not limited to one demographic group, but includes people who want a more reflective democracy.\"",

Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to gain the majority. In a statement provided to CBS News, the campaign said that the $10 million \"Need to Vote\" initiative will be allocated to hire on-the-ground volunteer coordinators and run digital and letter-writing campaigns. The funds will also be used in a local and national television ad campaign that will run through Election Day.\u00a0 Some of the funds will also be dedicated to organizing house parties and other events that Steyer will attend. Need to Impeach claims that it already has 5.5 million members.\u00a0 \"Midterm elections are about turning out your votes and making a statement,\" Steyer said in the statement. \"That starts with more than 5.5 million people voting like never before. Our goal is to win and to send a message to Congress and Donald Trump alike that no one is above the law.\" Steyer, who made the announcement in Lansing, Michigan via video conference, said many of the resources through the initiative will be distributed to competitive races across the nation. \"On average, we have 10,000 supporters in the country's most competitive House districts,\" Steyer said. \"We expect many of these races will be decided by a few thousand, if not hundreds, of votes. That means that if our movement shows up in November, we can change who controls the House.\" Kevin Mack, Need to Impeach's lead strategist, said this initiative is a \"fifty state movement\" aimed at every congressional district, but noted more resources will be available in the competitive districts. \"Winning the House is our top priority,\" Mack said. \"We will have extra efforts in the 63 most competitive districts listed by the Cook Report and the national campaign committees.\" Matt Gorman, the communications director at the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), responded to the announcement saying impeachment, single-payer healthcare and immigration are issues that serve as a \"litmus test\" for the Democrats. \"Along with single-payer healthcare and abolishing ICE, impeachment is quickly a litmus test among Democrats. If voters want more dysfunction in Congress, then voting for Nancy Pelosi and Tom Steyer is the way to get it,\" Gorman said. CBS News reporter covering the Senate.",

            "article_content": "New Mexico, a state with deep historical ties to American Indians whose images and symbols are rooted in everything from the state flag to town names, has moved closer to electing the first Native American woman to the U.S. House of Representatives. Deb Haaland's victory Tuesday in a Democratic primary for an open congressional seat encompassing the state's largest city of Albuquerque had Native Americans from Washington state to Oklahoma celebrating the possibility of a landmark in U.S. political history. Haaland, a tribal member of the Laguna Pueblo who was born in Winslow, Arizona, defeated a crowded field of mainly Hispanic candidates. It came almost 50 years to the day that Robert F. Kennedy won South Dakota's Democratic presidential primary thanks to the Native American vote on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Haaland told The Associated Press on Wednesday that she credited her victory to the movement of Native American voting that Kennedy sparked and her 15 years working as an organizer registering such voters. \"The Native vote has helped a lot of candidates win. The Native vote can sway a statewide election,\" she said. \"I think if we keep working hard to get out to vote and to stay active, we can have a larger say in our politics.\" Winners of Tuesday's primaries include a candidate to become South Dakota's first woman governor, a candidate to be the first Native American woman in the U.S. House and a 28-year-old who could become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.\u00a0 Haaland faces Republican former state lawmaker Janice Arnold-Jones and Libertarian candidate Lloyd Princeton, both of whom are white, in the general election. Democrats have held the seat in recent years. News of Haaland's primary victory spread far beyond New Mexico, home to 23 tribes whose population is about 11 percent Native American. \"Her win brings us closer to this historic moment,\" said Mark Trahant, editor of Indian Country Today website. \"Congress has never had a voice like her.\" Trahant said Haaland's candidacy also generated excitement in Indian Country as more women of color run for office. Paulette Jordan, a Democratic candidate for governor in Idaho and member of the Coeur d'Alene tribe, came to New Mexico to campaign on Haaland's behalf. Haaland, 57, also pulled together a multiethnic coalition that sought to work outside the usual white and Hispanic powerbrokers. She won the support of the Congressional Black Caucus political action committee, and Rep. Gwen Moore, a black Democratic congresswoman from Milwaukee, traveled to Albuquerque this week to stump for her. In last minute canvassing, Haaland had white teachers, Muslim volunteers and young Latina making last-minute calls on her behalf. \"This is going to be big,\" Moore told Haaland supporters before Tuesday's election. Haaland said if she makes it to Congress, she will work to fight poverty in Native American communities and climate change. Her Republican opponent credited Haaland for being a hard worker and for achieving a political milestone. \"But we've elected people based on their identity and sexual orientation before and what good did that get us?\" Arnold-Jones asked. The Republican said voters in the central New Mexico congressional seat are pragmatic and will be turned off by Haaland's \"far left\" stances on abortion, immigration and rolling back the state's oil production economy. \"These aren't the issues that will resonate with voters here,\" Arnold-Jones said. \"You can't go into a legislative body and be mad at everyone.\" Haaland said she knows what's at stake in the election \u2014 for New Mexico voters but also for Native Americans nationwide. That's why she intends to use her biography as a selling point so voters know she's faced adversity. \"Yes, I know what it's like to have to live off food stamps ... yes, I've had my struggle with addiction,\" Haaland said referring to a bout with alcoholism. \"Sadly, that affects our society here in New Mexico.\"",

            "article_content": "By Anthony Salvanto, Jennifer De Pinto, Kabir Khanna and Fred Backus In the race for Congress, most polls report one national percentage for Democrats and Republicans. But that's not very helpful \u2013 because this is a race for seats. 435 of them, in fact. So the CBS News/YouGov Battleground Tracker will report seats: how many districts the Democrats would get, and how many the Republicans would get, as of today. And we find the 2018 campaign looks like a toss-up contest for control at the moment, as the Democrats would most likely get 219 seats if the election were today (just one more than the 218 needed for a majority) and the Republicans 216. With a margin of error of nine seats on the model, control is totally up for grabs.\u00a0 This would amount to a sizable gain for Democrats, who currently hold 195 seats (including vacant seats) \u2013 yet it just barely puts them in position to take control, given the deficit they have to make up. But it's not yet the massive \"blue wave\" that some pundits have speculated will sweep the Democrats to a comfortable majority, despite their high-profile wins and strong turnout in recent special elections. There are a record number of women running, and that brings partisan splits: Republicans say it does not matter whether a candidate is a man or a woman, and those few who have a preference marginally prefer male candidates. Democrats are more likely to have a preference, and it's for the woman among those who do, by a nine-to-one ratio. Democratic women, in particular, very much would prefer a woman candidate, saying that women would have a better understanding of the issues they care about. We do all this based on a new, large-scale survey of voters across the country, concentrated in the competitive House districts, and then modeled using those voters' preferences, as well as district-level factors and demographics in all 435 districts. We'll track this as it changes \u2013 and as the competitive district list itself changes \u2013 throughout the year. With five months to go until Election Day, a majority of voters in battleground districts say their midterm vote this year matters just as much as in a presidential election. But Democrats (28 percent) are twice as likely as Republicans (14 percent) to say their midterm vote is more important than in a presidential election. The Democrats' fortunes do seem to hinge on dissatisfaction with the administration \u2013 half of their voters say they are voting against the Republicans rather than for the Democrats \u2013 and on less-reliable voters who don't typically vote in midterms, including some who didn't vote at in 2016 \u2013 but who tell us that they will now. On the other hand, most backing a Republican candidate say they're doing so to support the party and the president's policies, not to oppose the Democrats. Republicans hold a few advantages of their own and start off in position to still hang on to their majority, if a slimmer one. Voters say their local economies are good. Republican voters say they'll vote \u2013 and they have before. President Trump's voters are still with him and the party. They don't all approve of how he handles himself personally, but they do like that he's shaking up the establishment, and while some are unsure what they'll do, they aren't considering Democrats. Still, many voters in these battleground districts say they have yet to feel the impact of some Trump administration and GOP policies such as changes to the health care law and trade policies. More than four in 10 say they haven't felt any impact from the recent tax law, but among those who have, they say it's been more positive than negative, particularly Republicans. While most Republicans overall like Mr. Trump and his policies, most voters in these battleground districts dislike the way the president handles himself personally (62 percent), and a smaller majority dislike his policies overall (51 percents). Democrats are benefitting from a significant gender gap: by double-digits, women plan to back the Democratic candidate over the Republican, while Republicans lead among men by five points. There is a divide by education as well. White voters without a college degree were some of Mr. Trump's strongest backers and say they are backing Republicans for Congress, while Democrats lead with white college graduates. While Democrats may poised to make gains, more than half of voters don't think either party in Congress has been trying to address the things they care about. Partisans think their own party is trying at least some to address their concerns, but few partisans think they are doing a lot on that. Right now, the GOP has a slight edge with independents, some of whom like the president's policies -- but not the way he handles himself personally. About a quarter of them aren't sure who'll they vote for. Overall, voters in these competitive districts want to hear a lot from congressional candidates on health care, jobs and wages, and immigration. Democrats and Republicans have different priorities. Most Republicans want to hear a lot about immigration, followed by jobs and wages, and health care. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans say the arrival of new immigrants has changed the area where they live, and most say it's for the worse. For Democrats, they want candidates to focus on health care a lot, as well as income inequality, education and teacher salaries, and jobs. They are more likely than Republicans to say unemployment and the availability of good jobs is a problem where they live. Four in 10 Democrats want to hear a lot from candidates about the Russia investigation, ranking it lower in priority than these other issues. Only 9 percent of Republicans want candidates to talk a lot about that issue.  Because this poll dives into local areas and districts, we asked voters how things are in their area \u2013 and Democrats and Republicans both report opioids and gas prices are concerns in their locales. Few in either party see gangs as a big problem where they live. They differ some on jobs: more Democrats than Republicans see unemployment and the availability of good jobs as a problem. While Republicans see a better jobs situation, they say that the arrival of new immigrants is changing their local area, and in their view, for the worse. The House estimate is based on a multilevel regression and post-stratification model incorporating voter responses to this survey and has a margin of error of +/- 9 seats. The CBS News 2018 Battleground Tracker is a panel study based on interviews conducted of a representative sample of registered voters in 64 competitive and likely competitive congressional districts in the United States fielded between May 24\u201330, 2018 with 5,693 respondents.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has long been an unlikely sweetheart for conservative and evangelical voters. Now, in the lead-up to the midterm elections, the thrice-married former Democrat who used to describe himself as \"very pro-choice\" is offering catnip to conservative voters with a new administration push to strip funding from Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics. The initiative, announced last week, has arrived just in time for Mr. Trump to highlight it Tuesday night when he speaks at the Susan B. Anthony List's annual \"Campaign for Life Gala.\" It is aimed at resurrecting parts of a Reagan-era mandate banning federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions, or sharing space with abortion providers. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List, says the move \"will help tremendously\" in the midterm elections. It's also the latest evidence that as he frets over the Russia investigation and prepares for a planned summit with North Korea, Mr. Trump has also been focused on fulfilling campaign promises and tending to issues that galvanize his base: holding a series of events to rail against the dangers of illegal immigration, pulling out of the Iran-nuclear deal and wading anew into the fight over abortion rights. Mr. Trump is far from a natural fit for conservative voters. He recently admitted to reimbursing his lawyer for paying pay hush money to a porn star who claimed she had sex with Mr. Trump (a charge that he denies). And Mr. Trump has bragged about groping women without their permission. During the campaign, he sometimes had trouble articulating his views on abortion, at one point suggesting women should be punished for having abortions. His campaign later walked back the statement, saying that if abortion were ever outlawed, he believed that doctors who perform them should be punished. Nonetheless, white evangelical voters overwhelmingly supported Mr. Trump in 2016, and that support has only grown. A PRRI survey released last month found white evangelical support for Mr. Trump at an all-time high, with 75 percent of those polled holding a favorable view of the president and just 22 percent holding an unfavorable view. Support for Mr. Trump within the general population in the poll stood at just 42 percent. Religious groups like the Catholic Medical Association approve of a series of actions Mr. Trump has taken, beginning with his appointment of judges who oppose abortion rights, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Trump's reinstatement of the global \"gag rule\" that bars federal funding for nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion referrals. Mr. Trump has also surrounded himself with staffers with deep ties to conservative groups, including counselor Kellyanne Conway and Director of Strategic Communications Mercedes Schlapp. Ralph Reed, chairman of the private Faith & Freedom Coalition, also pointed to the president's dismantling of the Iran nuclear deal and his decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as steps that have played especially well with evangelical voters. But he said the president's actions on abortion hold special sway, in part because of Trump's early struggle with the issue. \"On a policy level, I see it as a series of promises made and promises kept. And in this case, a pro-life promise made and pro-life promise kept. And I would argue those are the most important promises to keep because he was someone who was believed, accurately or otherwise, as a recent arrival to conservatism and someone who had an ideologically mixed past,\" Reed said. Reed added that as president, \"Trump has done everything that he can to keep faith with the faith-based voters that provided him with his margin of victory in 2016.\" When it comes to the midterms, Reed said, \"I expect Donald Trump to be rewarded for these efforts by a similarly historic turnout among evangelical and other pro-life voters.\" Dannenfelser, whose group works to elect candidates who want to reduce and ultimately end abortion, is planning to raise and spend $25 million this cycle, up from the $18 million the group spent in the lead-up to the 2016 elections. She said the president's latest move would play especially well with voters in states like Missouri, where Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley is challenging Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, one of the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents, as well as in Indiana and North Dakota, where Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. \"He has proved himself refreshingly predictable,\" Dannenfelser said of Trump's record on abortion issues. The other side, meanwhile, is preparing for a potential legal fight against Mr. Trump's latest action and aiming to build support for candidates who support abortion rights. \"We have to fight back in the best way we know how,\" the group Emily's List wrote in a fundraising email, \"electing pro-choice Democratic women who will always protect reproductive freedom.\"",

A video of Hyde-Smith posted to Twitter earlier this month showed her praising a supporter, saying: \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\" These comments were interpreted as insensitive because Mississippi had the most lynchings between 1882 and 1968 of any other state, with 581 lynchings. Espy, a former Clinton official and congressman, is black. Later, another video posted by the same person on Twitter, the publisher of a liberal-leaning news site, showed Hyde-Smith discussing \"liberal folks\" and making it \"just a little more difficult\" for them to vote. At the debate on Tuesday, Hyde-Smith said that her comments had been turned into \"a political weapon to be used against me.\" \"For anyone who was offended by my comments, I certainly apologize. There was no ill will, no intent whatsoever in my statements,\" she said. \"I also recognize that this comment was twisted and was turned into a weapon to be used against me. a political weapon used for nothing but personal and political gain by my opponent. That's the kind of politics Mississippians are sick and tired of.\" Espy retorted: \"No one twisted it. It came out of your mouth. It has caused our state harm. It has rejuvenated stereotypes that we don't need.\" Hyde-Smith initially\u00a0refused to further explain her \"public hanging\" comments beyond an initial statement saying the reaction was overblown, and her campaign has said that the comments about creating barriers to voting were made in jest. However, the controversy is already having consequences: Walmart, the nation's largest retail chain, has asked the Hyde-Smith campaign\u00a0to refund a total of $4,000 in campaign donations. Mississippi has a sizable black population, which comprises nearly 40 percent of the population as a whole. Espy, who if elected would be the first black person to represent Mississippi in the Senate since Reconstruction, might be able to inspire black voters to turn out in a special election. Black voters buoyed Democrat Doug Jones to victory in his Senate race in neighboring Alabama last year. Still, Hyde-Smith is the favorite to win in the race. President Trump is visiting Mississippi on Monday to rally on her behalf and encourage Republicans to vote. Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that Hyde-Smith is a \"spectacular woman\" who \"feels very badly\" about the comments she made. Most of the debate on Tuesday was spent discussing protection for patients with preexisting conditions. Hyde-Smith said the legislation she is cosponsoring with Sen. Thom Tillis to protect patients with preexisting conditions shows her commitment to the issue. Espy pointed out that the legislation would require the insurance companies to cover the patient with a preexisting condition but does not require the company to provide the treatment for the condition itself. Hyde-Smith said Espy denied an employee a promotion because he had a daughter with a preexisting condition. which Espy denied. Preexisting conditions was the dominant issues but the debaters also covered illegal immigration, education shortages, and infrastructure reform. Espy presented himself as a moderate and said he had a policy of \"Mississippi first\" that would tie him to the voter, not the party or president. Hyde-Smith aligned herself with the president on each issue and encouraged viewers to claim their tickets to the two Trump rallies on Monday.",

            "article_content": "By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus and Anthony Salvanto Seven in 10 Americans think President Trump should allow the Russia investigation to continue, and a slight majority think Congress should pass legislation to prevent Special Counsel Robert Mueller from being fired.\u00a0 Most Republicans think the president should allow the investigation to continue, but don't support Congress passing legislation to protect Mueller from being fired.\u00a0 Overall, 52 percent of Americans think Congress should pass legislation to protect the special counsel in charge of the Russia investigation from being fired, including three out of four Democrats and most independents. Sixty-seven percent of Republicans, however, disagree. Fifty-one percent of Americans see the special counsel's Russia investigation as politically motivated rather than justified (46 percent), but seven in 10 think President Trump should allow the investigation to continue, including 57 percent of Republicans. Little has changed since the 2018 congressional elections regarding evaluations of Donald Trump's overall job performance. His approval rating is 39 percent among Americans overall \u2013 the same as last month \u2013 with 85 percent of Republicans approving and 90 percent of Democrats disapproving of the job he's doing.\u00a0 By almost three to one, more Americans saw the midterm elections as a rejection of Mr. Trump and his policies than an endorsement. Democrats were particularly likely to see it this way. Less than a quarter of Republicans saw the election as a rejection of the President, and half said it wasn't about him.\u00a0 But Americans continue to have positive views of the economy and the President's handling of that particular issue. Fifty-two percent of Americans approve of the way Donald Trump is handling the economy, including nine in 10 Republicans and slight majority of independents. In contrast, most disapprove of his handling of immigration and U.S. relations with its European allies. The percentage of Americans that thinks the economy is good continues to climb. Now, 74 percent rate the economy positively, up four points from last month and the highest percentage recorded since March 2001. \u00a0 This poll was conducted by telephone November 15-18, 2018 among a random sample of 1,103 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.\u00a0 Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.\u00a0 The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi held a press conference\u00a0on Capitol Hill Wednesday, hours after Democrats recaptured the House in the midterm elections Tuesday night. Pelosi discussed the gains in the House and in Democratic governorships, and called the day after the election was \"great day for America\" and a chance to \"restore the health of our democracy.\" She pledged to find \"bipartisanship\" and \"common ground where we can.\" \"The biggest winner yesterday was health care for the American people, for our seniors, and for American families,\" Pelosi said. While President Trump and Republicans had pivoted to focusing on immigration in the final weeks of the campaign, Democrats stuck firmly to health care-related talking points. \"We won because from the beginning we focused on health care,\" she said. She also reiterated she was willing to work on a bipartisan basis with Mr. Trump. \"I worked very productively with President Bush when we had the majority and he had the presidency,\" she said, referring to the first time she became House speaker, in 2006. \"We will strive for bipartisanship. We believe that we have a responsibility to seek common ground where we can. Where we cannot must stand our ground, but we must try,\" she added. Pelosi addressed potential Democratic investigations into Mr. Trump's personal finances and his administration but declined to take a hard stance on the issue. She said the House has \"a constitutional responsibility to have oversight,\" but the Democrats would not have any \"scattershot freelancing\" in terms of conducting investigations. \"When we go down any of these paths, we'll know what we're doing, and we'll do it right,\" she said, adding Democrats would look to \"unify the country.\" Even though several Democratic candidates have said they would not vote for Pelosi as speaker, she said she was confident she would be elected speaker. She has previously suggested she could be a \"transitional\" speaker. \"It's not about what you have done, it's about what you can do. And I think I'm the best person to go forward to unify, to negotiate,\" she said. Pelosi told supporters late Tuesday in Washington that Democrats would use their majority to focus on issues like health care and draining the \"swamp\" of special interests and dark money. Though she said Democrats would act as a check on Mr. Trump, Pelosi promised to strive for bipartisanship and work with Republicans to \"lower the cost of health care, of prescription drugs, raise wages, and clean up corruption to work for all Americans.\" \"We have all had enough of division,\" she said Tuesday night. \"Americans want peace. They want results.\"",

            "article_content": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be the youngest woman ever elected into Congress following her midterm election win Tuesday. The 29-year-old New York Democrat skyrocketed into the national spotlight earlier this year after a grassroots campaign and primary victory over 10-term incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley. \"It is a privilege and an honor to say that we have also elected the youngest woman in American history to serve in Congress,\" she told supporters in New York City Tuesday night. \"This is what is possible when everyday people come together in the collective realization that all our actions no matter how small or how large are powerful, worthwhile, and capable of lasting change.\"\u00a0 Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned on a platform that included Medicare for all and free college tuition, told CBS News' \"Face The Nation\" in July that a populist-style approach \"absolutely\" brings out new voters.\u00a0 \"So for us, this is about inspiring people to the polls, giving them something to vote for, creating hope for this nation, and knowing that so long as there are working class Americans who believe in a prosperous and just future we will have hope, no matter how red the district,\" she said.\u00a0 She also spent months leading up the midterm elections\u00a0fundraising and stumping\u00a0for other progressives, including Michigan's Rashida Tlaib, who became one of the first two Muslim women elected into Congress.\u00a0 Ocasio-Cortez wasn't the only 29-year-old elected last night. Iowa's Abby Finkenauer shares that distinction. But Finkenauer is a few months older and will turn 30 about a week before they're sworn in Jan. 3, 2019. Over the course of history, there have been a number of men elected to Congress in their 20s, but not women. Ocasio-Cortez caught the eye of potential voters last spring after her campaign video went viral, racking up 300,000 views on its first day. In an interview with CBSN's Tanya Rivero in May, Ocasio-Cortez said she wrote it herself. (You can watch that interview below.) She will represent New York's 14th Congressional district, which covers parts of Queens and the Bronx, and is 50 percent Latino and 70 percent voters of color, according to\u00a0New York Magazine. As part of her platform, Ocasio-Cortez told CBSN she wanted to defund Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\u00a0 \"ICE was just established in 2003 and it was established outside of the U.S. Department of Justice, so a lot of this disturbing behavior we are seeing \u2013 parents can separated from their children, people getting picked up on the street \u2013 it's happening outside of the Justice Department,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in the June interview.\u00a0 A native of the Bronx who attended Boston University, Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and a community organizer who worked on Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign.\u00a0 Christopher Brito is a social media manager and trending content writer for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "President Trump at a campaign rally in Florida\u00a0 on Wednesday accused the media of \"pushing people apart\" in the wake of the Pittsburgh synagagoue shooting that killed 11 people. Mr. Trump called the Democratic candidate for governor, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, calling him a \"Venezuela-style\" dictator who had taken \"bribes.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump's rally in Estero, Florida, is the first in a string of campaign appearances in the days before the midterm elections. Mr. Trump is visiting Tennessee, Georgia, West Virginia and Ohio before Election Day, as well as an additional rally in Florida, and two appearances each in Missouri and Indiana. Mr. Trump has endorsed the Republican candidate for governor, Ron DeSantis, and the Republican candidate for Senate, current Governor Rick Scott, both of whom are locked in extremely tight races. DeSantis in particular has embraced Mr. Trump. Scott and DeSantis both spoke briefly at the rally. At one point, the crowd chanted \"lock him up\" about Gillum.\u00a0 \"Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum would be a disaster for Florida's economy,\" Mr. Trump said about DeSantis and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, Scott's opponent. Mr. Trump traveled to Florida after a tumultuous week that included the arrest of a man for allegedly sending to several Democratic leaders and other critics of Mr. Trump and a mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. The president went to Pittsburgh on Tuesday, but congressional and city leaders did not appear with him, and he was met with several protesters. Mr. Trump began his rally by addressing the massacre in Pittsburgh, praising law enforcement and offering condolences. \"We pledge our resolve to remove the vile poison of anti-Semitism,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that there was \"unbreakable solidarity\" with the Jewish people. He then pivoted to criticize the media for using \"tragedy to sow anger and division,\" as the press had reported on the protests that faced Mr. Trump. He accused the media of \"pushing people apart.\" He said that the reporting was \"fake and make believe,\" even though over 1,000 protesters did gather to demonstrate their opposition to Mr. Trump in Pittsburgh. He did, however, acknowledge that there were some \"very good people\" in the media. \"The media doesn't want you to hear your story,\" Mr. Trump added, saying that 33 percent of the country believed that the press was \"the enemy of the people.\" He also repeatedly referred to the media as left-wing. In his speech, Mr. Trump focused on his typical stump speech topics, such as illegal immigration and criticism of the Democratic Party. He also discussed the migrant caravans on the way to the U.S. from Central America, who are several weeks away from arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. \"We're getting prepared for the caravan, folks, you don't have to worry about that,\" Mr. Trump said of the migrants, most of whom are seeking asylum. Over 5,000 active-duty military troops have been\u00a0sent to guard the border, and Mr. Trump reporters that he may send up to 15,000 troops to the border, more than are currently stationed in Afghanistan. Mr. Trump also discussed birthright citizenship, a recent top campaign issue for Mr. Trump. The president\u00a0said in an interview\u00a0with \"Axios on HBO\" published on Tuesday that he was considering signing an executive order that would eliminate birthright citizenship, meaning that children of non-citizens and illegal immigrants would not automatically be U.S. citizens if they were born on American soil. This proposal has\u00a0excited some Republicans, but many have raised concerns about its constitutionality. The country has engaged in a debate over political rhetoric in recent days. Cesar Sayoc, the man who allegedly sent the bombs, was a steadfast Trump supporter who had promoted right-wing conspiracy theories and threatened Democratic politicians on Twitter. Pittsburgh shooting suspect Robert Bowers told police officers that he wanted to \"kill Jews,\" according to charging documents, and had previously made anti-Semitic comments online. These prominent examples of hateful rhetoric culminating in violence have led many on the left to point to Mr. Trump for his incendiary political language. The president and his allies have vehemently denied that his heated rhetoric in rallies encouraged divisiveness. Mr. Trump also blamed the media for sowing discord in American politics. \"There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly,\" he tweeted on Monday. During a campaign rally in North Carolina on Friday, after the arrest of Sayoc, Mr. Trump often noted that he was \"being nice\" by using a quieter tone and softer rhetoric. \"Political violence must never, ever be allowed in America and I will do everything in my power to stop it,\" Mr. Trump said at the rally, calling for an \"end to the politics of personal destruction.\" At a mention of the media, the crowd chanted \"CNN sucks,\" while Mr. Trump looked on. Mr. Trump discussed birthright citizenship with reporters as he left the White House. \"In my opinion, it's much less complex than people think,\" Mr. Trump said. He added that he didn't need a constitutional amendment to eliminate birthright citizenship, but it could be accomplished by congressional action or executive order. He also denied that he had contributed to a culture of divisiveness in the country. \"I'm not fear-mongering at all,\" he said.

The ad, produced by Bloomberg and RadicalMedia and directed by Foster, is part of a digital effort to support Democrats for the House of Representatives, according to a statement. It will run nationally and in competitive house races through Nov. 6. The ad is funded by Independence USA PAC and features Cher, Minnie Driver, Felicity Huffman, Marlee Matlin, Julianne Moore, Ellen Pompeo, Lily Tomlin, Christy Turlington-Burns, Constance Wu and others. It highlights issues such as immigration, healthcare, climate change, LGBTQ rights, and gun safety. Polls show white, college-educated women are backing Democrats this cycle by a significantly greater margin than they did in 2016. Hillary Clinton won this particular demographic by just six points in the presidential contest. A recent Washington Post\u00a0survey\u00a0found that 62 percent of white college women backed Democrats while 35 percent support Republicans. And\u00a0data\u00a0from the Pew Research center finds Democrats with a 36-point advantage among this group. A CBS News battleground tracker poll finds that 47 percent of college-educated women in key House districts plan to vote in November in opposition to Trump. Meanwhile, 24 percent say their vote is in support of President Trump and 29 percent say their vote isn't about the president. Separately, the Trump campaign announced Monday\u00a0that it is launching its own a $6 million broadcast and digital ad buy to urge voters to back Republicans in next week's\u00a0midterm elections. That ad does not mention the president's name, and instead focuses on the country's low unemployment rate and improvements in the economy, with the narrator warning that \"this could all go away if we don't remember where we came from and choose the right future.\"",

Chris Coons said he is \"not optimistic\" Congress will take any actions on gun control, after the Parkland, Fla., high school shooting that left 17 people dead last week.\u00a0 The Delaware Democrat said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that he doesn't have high hopes that Congress will do anything to restrict gun access, after 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz allegedly used an AR-15 rifle to gun down his former classmates. CBS News' Nancy Cordes asked Coons if it is possible any legislation could have prevented the tragedy. \"Possible? Yes. Likely that that action will be taken in this Congress? No,\" Coons said. \"And I have to say, Nancy, having heard the voices of other teenagers from Parkland whose high school classmates were gunned down, it is heartbreaking. I am heartsick over the fact that we in Congress have failed to act to protect our teenagers, to protect schools and churches, to protect America's safe spaces from the scourge of gun violence.\" Coons said there are a number of bipartisan proposals that would address gaps in the current background check system. \"There are things we should do to make it harder for people with mental health problems, people who are convicted felons, people who have domestic violence convictions, from easily getting guns,\" Coons said. \"There are bipartisan bills in this Congress, and the last one, that have not been taken up and acted on.\" Coons blamed Republicans for the failure of bipartisan legislation limiting \"bump stocks,\" a gun enhancement used by the Las Vegas shooter in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history in October. The bill has yet to receive a floor vote in either chamber of Congress. Cordes asked why the Democratic Party hasn't \"kept the heat on\" when it comes to bump stocks.\u00a0 \"There have been efforts,\" Coons said. \"But let's be blunt. One party controls the floor in the Senate and the House. The Republicans determine what's going to get a vote.\" Coons said he's \"usually a very optimistic person,\" but not when it comes to gun control -- especially after Congress' failure to approve bipartisan legislation on immigration last week.\u00a0 \"I am not optimistic that until there is real action by the American public to demand change in Congress, that we're going to see real action to confront gun violence out of this Congress,\" Coons said.\u00a0 Coons, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also commented on the surprise announcement of\u00a0charges against 13 Russians\u00a0brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The defendants are accused of carrying out a massive disinformation campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0 The indictment did not allege the Russians' interference influenced the results of the election, but Coons said it's hard to say.\u00a0 \"It's hard to say that this didn't affect the outcome,\" Coons said. \"It was an exceptionally close election.\" Coons said Russian President Vladimir Putin will continue to meddle in U.S. affairs until he is stopped. Coons emphasized that the president should use his authority to impose additional sanctions against Russia.\u00a0 \"To me, the most maddening question is, why is President Trump failing to act to protect our democracy when there is indisputable proof now that Russia interfered in our 2016 elections?\" Coons said.\u00a0",

Still, a majority continue to say the country is off on the wrong track. Three in four disapprove of the job Congress is doing, and most view both political parties negatively. More than half continue to disapprove of the job Donald Trump is doing as president. \u00a0 Seven in 10 of Americans say the economy is in good shape; the public's most positive evaluation heading into a midterm election in decades. \u00a0And 42 percent of Americans think the economy is improving. Among those who feel that way, most are confident that it will continue to improve in the long run. Majorities of both Republicans and Democrats say the economy is good, although Republicans feel especially positive. As they have for years, a majority of Americans (58 percent) say the country is off on the wrong track. Unlike opinions of the economy, these views divide starkly along partisan lines: most Republicans feel the country is headed in the right direction, but most Democrats don't.  Americans who think the country is off on the wrong track are basing that view on factors other than the economy. \u00a0More than half (55 percent) say the state of politics and how the government is functioning is the main reason.\u00a0 About a third say it's the culture and values that they see in society today.  For those who feel the country is headed in the right direction, it is about the economy.  About three in four cite the state of the economy and their own finances as the main reason they feel good about where the country is headed. Heading into the midterm elections, 42 percent of voters nationwide approve of the job Donald Trump is doing as president. His approval is a bit lower, at 39 percent among Americans overall. Opinions of the country's direction are tied to views of President Trump: Those who like where the country's headed approve of the job he's doing, and those who are concerned about the country's direction doing disapprove.  Of the issues asked about in the poll, the president gets his highest approval rating from voters on handling the economy (52 percent), and his lowest ratings on immigration (39 percent) and his handling of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination (41 percent). The President's overall approval rating is higher than Congress' -- as is typically the case. Congress has just a 17 percent approval rating among registered voters, not much changed from earlier this year. Majorities of Republicans and Democrats disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job.  And most voters hold negative views of both major political parties. Majorities of Republicans and Democrats have favorable views of their own party, but Democrats (22 percent) are twice as likely as Republicans (11 percent) to have an unfavorable view of their own party.  While both parties are viewed negatively, more voters would prefer the Democrats win control (51 percent) of Congress than the Republicans keep it (42 percent). Three percent of voters say it doesn't matter. This poll was conducted by telephone October 14-17, 2018 among a random sample of 1,108 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.  Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.  The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

            "article_content": "MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Actor Alec Baldwin followed up his latest parody portrayal of President Trump with a serious call Sunday night for voters to use the Nov. 6 midterm elections to peacefully \"overthrow\" the government. After reprising his role as the president on \"Saturday Night Live,\" Baldwin flew to New Hampshire, where he was the keynote speaker at the New Hampshire Democratic Party's annual fall fundraising dinner. \"The way we implement change in America is through elections. We change governments here at home in an orderly and formal way,\" he said. \"In that orderly and formal way and lawful way, we need to overthrow the government of the United States under Donald Trump.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday night. Baldwin said on issue after issue, Republicans are destroyers, not builders. \"There is a small cadre of people currently in power who are hell-bent on continuing a malicious immigration policy that has set this country up for human rights violations charges by the global community. This cadre has looted money from the federal treasury and deposited it directly into the bank accounts of their most ardent political supporters,\" he said. Alec Baldwin says he would \"absolutely win\" race against Trump He said Republicans \"shrug\" when it comes to gun violence, \"spit in the face\" at the rest of the world at the notion of changing outdated energy policies and offer neither hope nor solutions to people of color \"who seek a decent seat at the American economic table but instead are issued a prison term, or worse, a bullet.\" The recent confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh showed that Republicans view women as undeserving of the same constitutional protections as men, Baldwin said. \"They themselves are sons, husbands, fathers, and yet when the time arrived in the thick of the #MeToo movement to set politics aside and establish that women's rights were more important than political expediency, they failed and it was ugly,\" he said. Several of the political leaders and candidates who spoke before Baldwin praised survivors of sexual assault who were moved to tell their stories during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, saying they should inspire others to speak up and advocate for issues they care about. \"People raising their voices and sharing their experiences is what has been critical for our democracy and our capacity to move forward throughout our history,\" U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan said. \"As difficult as the Kavanaugh battle was, those moments have been incredibly important and will continue to be as we move forward.\" Congressional candidate Chris Pappas echoed that sentiment. \"If we're not hoarse by the time the election rolls around, we're not doing our jobs or we're not paying attention,\" he said. \"It's about raising our voices and what we're all about as a country.\" In 2016, U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster went public with her own account of a renowned heart surgeon reaching up her skirt during a business luncheon more than 40 years ago, when she was a young staffer on Capitol Hill. \"I want to say to everyone, to the survivors who have come forward and those who have not, I believe you and you are not alone,\" Kuster said Sunday. Baldwin's appearance in the state that holds the first presidential primary came hours before the premiere of his new talk show. \"The Alec Baldwin Show,\" which airs on ABC at 10 p.m., will feature one-on-one conversations with celebrities and cultural icons. But Baldwin said it won't be overtly political. Asked Sunday if he'd consider running for office himself, he didn't rule it out but joked that he did, his wife would likely divorce him.",

Arizona voters on both sides of the aisle tell CBS News there's one thing they agree on: The race to replace Flake is ugly, and they want the ugliness to stop. \"I'm disgusted by all of it,\" said Laurie Bernstein, one voter. Sinema, the Democrat, is a three-term congresswoman who voted 62 percent of the time with the president's party rather than her own. McSally, a former Air Force combat pilot and Trump critic, has lately embraced the president. Never before have Arizonans sent a woman to the Senate, and our latest poll shows the two are just 3 points apart, which is within the margin of error. About one-third of Arizona voters will be making choices based on local issues but about two-thirds will be voting on national issues. \"I don't have to tell anyone how important this election is, because we see it everyday and the difference couldn't be more clear,\" McSally said.   The differences are over immigration, tax reform and, of course, health care.  \"I went without health insurance for part of my own childhood while my family was struggling with poverty, and so I understand how important it is,\" Sinema said. \"Right now Arizonans are paying, and they're paying too much.\" A key issue is coverage for the nearly 3 million Arizonans with preexisting conditions. In Congress, Sinema voted to keep that coverage under Obamacare. McSally voted to repeal it, but said she still wants to cover those with preexisting conditions.\u00a0 \"We need to move toward a system that provides more choice so that the cost comes down,\" McSally told us. \"The Obama experiment has failed.\" In this historic battle, getting out the vote will be critical. If Sinema succeeds, she'll be the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Arizona since 1988. \"I think Arizonans don't care whether the person who's serving in office has an R or a D behind their name. What they do care about is who's going to get stuff done and who's serving their interests,\" Sinema said. \"That sound likes somebody who's not trying to run as a Democrat,\" McSally said. \"So, look, her party is going so far left and are so far out of the mainstream of Arizona values. But the bottom line is, she's a Democrat.\" The big question now is, will this red state stay red, or finally turn blue? Jeff Glor has reported all over the world for CBS News since 2007.

            "article_content": "The conservative state of Texas is becoming a major focal point ahead of next month's midterm elections. Incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz won his seat by almost 16 percentage points in 2012, but recent polls show a rising Democratic star, Congressman Beto O'Rourke, is within single digits. Despite the state's changing demographics, O'Rourke will need strong support from Latinos and young voters to beat Cruz. For Cruz, winning re-election in the deeply-red state of Texas should be easy. But Cruz now finds himself in a tight race against O'Rourke, who's trying to turn the state blue for the first time since 1994.\u00a0  \"I think at this moment, it's not about Democrats or Republicans or party politics or the differences that have always seemed define us. It's about this country coming together around the things that we care most about at this moment of truth,\" O'Rourke told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Bianna Golodryga. \"We're either going to be a country of walls, Muslim bans, and the press as the enemy of the people, or instead we'll be defined by our ambitions.\" Asked why the race is as close as it is, Cruz said, \"At the end of the day, we're going to win this race. The reason that we have a competitive race is it is clear that the hard left, the extreme left in this country, that they're angry\u2026 Many of them are filled with hatred for President Trump and it colors everything else.\"\u00a0  The two couldn't be further apart on key issues. O'Rourke is trying to sell a progressive agenda, including stricter gun restrictions, universal health care, and abortion rights. Cruz said he's more aligned with Texans on multiple fronts, including border security and strong Second Amendment protections.\u00a0  \u00a0 \"Texans want lower taxes, we want lower regulations, we want more jobs, higher wages and more opportunity,\" Cruz said. \"We want to secure the border\u2026 Those are the common-sense values that bring Texas together.\"  \"Whether it's freeing 'Dreamers' from any fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens, or bringing Republicans and Democrats together to ensure that our immigration laws reflect our values and are written in our own image, those are things that Texans of all walks of life and background want us to lead on \u2013 want us to work together on,\" O'Rourke said.  Before running for Senate, O'Rourke was a punk rock bassist who ran a software company before being elected to three terms in Congress representing El Paso. His profile spiked last year when he live streamed an impromptu cross-country road trip-turned-townhall with Republican colleague Will Hurd.  \u00a0 His campaign has broken all conventional rules.  \u00a0 \"Not only have we been to every one of the 254 counties of Texas, we've accepted no help from political action committees, special interests or corporations \u2013 all people all the time,\" O'Rourke said.  Cruz is a conservative icon. The married father of two was the star of the failed 2013 government shutdown on Obamacare and the Republican that came closest to beating President Trump in the 2016 primaries. It was a fight that turned personal, with Mr. Trump calling him \"lying Ted Cruz.\"  \u00a0 \"A lot of people wonder, 'Why doesn't that seem to bother you more than it would anybody else?'\" Golodryga asked.   \"You know, I will say the media sadly is obsessed with personality, is obsessed with 'Trump derangement center.' Listen, we had a vigorous primary,\" Cruz said.  \"You told people to vote their conscience,\" Golodryga said.  \"It was hard fought, but it's over. And when the president was elected, I made a choice,\" Cruz said. \"I made a choice for the people of Texas. I can either choose to have hurt feelings and say, 'Alright, it's all about me and I'm going to be selfish and I'm going to take my marbles and go home.' Or I can choose to do my job which is represent 28 million Texans and work with the president, work cooperatively to get real solutions for real problems.\"  O'Rourke said he, too, would \"absolutely\" work with the president if elected senator. \u00a0 \"I'll find every possible way to work with anyone, including President Trump, as we have done in the past to advance this country's agenda and to do better for the people that I serve,\" O'Rourke said.\u00a0 Cruz also weighed in on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and questions raised about his temperament after his fiery testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said Kavanaugh \"absolutely\" has the temperament to be a Supreme Court Justice. \u00a0 \"That has been demonstrated because for over a decade, he has been one of the most respected federal appellate judges in the country,\" Cruz said.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "By Anthony Salvanto and Kabir Khanna Several incumbent Democratic senators are trying to win re-election in states that typically vote for Republicans, among them Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana, who are both locked in close contests with Republican challengers. New CBS News Battleground Tracker polling find Tester is up two points with likely voters over Republican Matt Rosendale, 47-45 percent in Montana, while in Missouri, McCaskill and Republican John Hawley are even in support among likely voters at 45-45 percent. Most supporters of all these candidates describe themselves as enthusiastic about voting this year.\u00a0 In Montana, the candidates predictably split the voters who see a Senate vote as a chance to support or oppose President Trump, but Tester gains from getting more of the voters who say the president is not a factor. Jon Tester is helped by a majority 53 percent approval on handling his job as senator, and he enjoys a ten-point gap among registered voters on which candidate understands the needs and problems of Montana \"a lot.\"\u00a0 By two to one, Montana voters who see an impact from the president's trade policies in their area say that impact has been a negative one, and Tester also draws nine in ten of those voters. A plurality of 43 percent of Montana voters say the recent tax cuts haven't had much impact on them, but of those who have felt an impact, it has been more positive than negative. By almost three to one, those who see an impact from the Republicans' recent changes to health care laws say the change has been a negative one for them.\u00a0 Turning to the race in Missouri, voters see national implications in the Senate race, as backers of both McCaskill and Hawley overwhelmingly say they want to help their party get, or keep, control of the Senate. Two-thirds of Josh Hawley's backers say their vote is at least partially to support the president, and two-thirds of McCaskill's say it is to oppose him. More of Hawley's voters say they are backing him primarily because he is a Republican than are McCaskill's voters backing her primarily because she is a Democrat; McCaskill's backers are relatively more likely to describe themselves as picking her on personal characteristics or issue stances, which might help explain her competitiveness in a state that Republican presidential candidates have usually carried easily. Most Missouri voters give the president at least some credit for a local economy that they say is good. But fewer Missouri voters say they are satisfied with the way things are going in the country right now, despite that economy, and seven in ten describe the midterm election as about national issues more than local and state ones. In both Montana and Missouri, voters say they like how the president is handling economic policy at much higher rates than how he handles himself personally. McCaskill holds an edge on handling health care, and in being seen as having \"a lot\" of understanding of Missouri's needs and problems. Hawley has an edge on issues of immigration and crime and gun policy. There may not be a lot of room for movement in the race,\u00a0as few of their current supporters say they'd even consider the other candidate \u2013 merely six percent of McCaskill's and seven percent of Hawley's \u2013 though in a contest this tight, any who do reconsider will likely prove pivotal. As with many Democrats across the country this year, McCaskill's fortunes might depend somewhat more heavily on voters who do not typically vote, or have not voted, in recent midterms. Twenty-two percent of her current supporters say they didn't vote in either of the last two midterms, as best they can recall, compared to 14 percent of Hawley's likely voters who describe their past turnout that way. The CBS News 2018 Battleground Tracker is a series of panel studies in the United States. The poll is conducted by YouGov, an online polling company. This poll interviewed 1104 registered voters in Missouri and 543 registered voters in Montana fielded between September 10\u201314, 2018. The respondents were selected to be representative of registered voters in terms of age, race, gender, and education. The margin of error for the entire sample is 3.3 in Missouri and 5.2 in Montana.

Both candidates emphasized their relationships with Mr. Trump, with Hawley embracing Trump talking points on immigration and other issues, and McCaskill trying to assert her independence from both the president and the Democrats.

            "article_content": "LONDON -- South Africa accused United States President Donald Trump of sowing division Thursday after he tweeted that the U.S. State Department would probe \"land and farm seizures... and the large scale killing of farmers.\" Trump's tweet apparently followed a segment on Fox News which claimed that South African President Cyril Ramaphosa had started \"seizing land from his own citizens without compensation because they are the wrong skin color.\" South Africa's foreign ministry said the tweet was \"based on false information.\" I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. \u201cSouth African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.\u201d @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews As elections due in 2019 approach, Ramaphosa has intervened to accelerate land reform in order to \"undo a grave historical injustice\" against the black majority during colonialism and the apartheid era that ended in 1994. 24 years later, the white community that makes up eight percent of the population \"possess 72 percent of farms\" compared to \"only four percent\" in the hands of black people who make up four-fifths of the population, according to Ramaphosa. South Africa totally rejects this narrow perception which only seeks to divide our nation and reminds us of our colonial past. #landexpropriation @realDonaldTrump @PresidencyZA To remedy the imbalance, the president recently announced that the constitution would be altered to allow for land to be seized and redistributed without compensation to the current owners. Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton sparked a diplomatic row with Pretoria in March after he said that Canberra should give \"special attention\" to white South African farmers seeking asylum because they faced a \"horrific\" situation. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted early Thursday that the state department would investigate \"land and farm seizures... and the large scale killing of farmers\" in South Africa. His statement was apparently in response to a Fox News report by Tucker Carlson, which claimed that the South African government had begun seizing land from white citizens based on the color of their skin. That report is blatantly untrue, CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reports. The Fox News story makes the false claim that South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has changed the constitution in order to confiscate land from farmers based on race. Here is what is actually happening: Earlier this month, Ramaphosa announced that the policy of his party, Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC), was to look at changing the constitution in order to allow for land expropriation without compensation and would proceed with plans carry out that change. No land has been seized yet, and in order to change the constitution, Ramaphosa would need a two-thirds majority in parliament, which the ANC does not have. They could potentially join forces with another party to get the votes they need, but even if they managed that, there would most likely be a number of legal challenges, and the issue would be tied up in constitutional court for some time, Patta reports. Land reform is one of South Africa's biggest unresolved issues, and Ramaphosa is under pressure from the left in his party to deal with it. He has not, however, provided any details of what expropriation without compensation would actually mean in practice, and the South African business community is treating his statements as party politics rather than a serious change in policy. The ANC is concerned it could lose substantial support in next year's general election following a decade of corrupt rule under former President Jacob Zuma. Beyond misunderstanding the context of land expropriation in South Africa, Patta says, what Mr. Trump has done in his tweet is conflate two South African issues: land expropriation and what is known as \"farm murders.\" South Africa has high rates of violent crime, Patta reports, but there has been a well-funded campaign by white right-wing South Africans to promote the idea that white farmers are being deliberately killed at higher rates than people of other skin colors, and that this constitutes a \"white genocide.\" There is no such thing in South Africa, she says. Farmers are easy targets for violent crime because they live on remote properties with little protection. A high murder rate has nothing to do with land seizures or anti-white sentiment. It is a crime issue, Patta reports. The proposed seizure of land is a concern to many in South Africa, especially given the fact that the country's economy is in recession, and the issue will most likely become an even bigger one closer to next year's election.",

            "article_content": "The ranks of forgotten Republicans are growing. Some were forced out, such as Tim Pawlenty, a former two-term Minnesota governor who lost this week's bid for a political comeback. Some, such as the retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker, chose to leave on their own. Others still serve, but with a muted voice. Whether members of Congress, governors or state party leaders, they are struggling to fit into President Donald Trump's Republican Party. The expanding list of marginalized GOP leaders underscores how thoroughly Mr. Trump has dominated \u2014 and changed \u2014 the Republican Party in the nearly two years since he seized the presidency. The overwhelming majority of elected officials, candidates and rank-and-file voters now follow the president with extraordinary loyalty, even if he strays far from the values and traditions many know and love. The Republicans left behind are warning their party with increasing urgency, though it's unclear whether anyone's listening. \"I hope this is a very temporary place for the Republican Party,\" said Corker. \"I hope that very soon we will return to our roots as a party that's very different, especially in tone, from we've seen coming out of the White House.\" The forgotten Republicans \u2014 people like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford and Ohio Gov. John Kasich \u2014 have been unwilling to sit quietly as Mr. Trump steers the GOP away from free trade, fiscal responsibility, consistent foreign policy and civility. Isolation and political exile have been their rewards. Their diminished roles leave fewer Republican leaders willing to challenge Mr. Trump under any circumstances, even in his darkest moments. Fact checkers have recorded an extraordinary level of false and misleading statements flowing out of the White House. And beyond dishonesty, some of the forgotten have decried a disturbing pattern of racially charged rhetoric on issues like immigration, NFL anthem protests and Confederate monuments. \"White nationalism isn't something I'm ever going to be comfortable with. But it is embraced by, or simply doesn't bother, a lot of Republicans,\" said former Ohio Republican Party chairman Matt Borges, once a Trump confidant who was forced from his leadership post after criticizing Trump in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election. After Mr. Trump's victory, Borges returned to practicing law, while he continues to play a modest role in local politics. \"To me, it became a matter of how much of your soul are you willing to sell. I would be the wrong person to be leading this party right now,\" Borges said. Mr. Trump remains popular among rank-and-file Republicans. And the vast majority of Republican candidates across the country this midterm season are pledging unconditional loyalty \u2014 and being rewarded with primary victories. Gallup found that 82 percent of Republicans approved of the president's job performance earlier this month. That's compared to just 34 percent of independents and 7 percent of Democrats. Kasich, who has not ruled out a primary bid against Mr. Trump in 2020, said the president's approval is misleading because the universe of people identifying as Republican is shrinking. \"We're dealing with a remnant of the Republican Party. The party is not what it was,\" Kasich said in an interview. The term-limited governor said he's content to focus quietly on addressing issues like the opioid epidemic and urban violence on a bipartisan basis while the Trump-led GOP focuses on partisan squabbling. \"Let those in the Republican Party who want to be ideological and partisan, let them wallow in their own failures,\" said Kasich. Other GOP leaders aren't feeling quite so emboldened. Pawlenty's quest for a third term collapsed after Republican primary voters determined his experience \u2014 and his years-old description of Trump as \"unfit and unhinged\" \u2014 weren't welcome. Pawlenty politely declined to be interviewed, but a former aide, Alex Conant, said this week's result, like other primary elections this year, sent a clear message about the modern GOP. \"There's not a lot of room for dissent in the Republican Party right now,\" Conant said. \"Moderates don't feel welcome. And if you're not loyal to Trump, there's not necessarily room for you.\" The details may be different, but Pawlenty's unexpected exit is reminiscent of other public officials who have struggled to find their footing in the Trump era. Bush, another Trump critic, declined to comment for this story. He has been forced into silence, at least in part, for fear of hurting his son's political career. In June, Donald Trump Jr. withdrew from a fundraiser for Texas land commissioner George P. Bush after Jeb Bush criticized the president's policy of separating immigrant children from their families at the border. Another periodic Trump critic, former House Speaker John Boehner, is in the midst of a 20-stop bus tour to help raise money for vulnerable House Republicans. Just don't ask whom he's raising money for. Spokesman David Schnittger said it was up to each of the campaigns involved to disclose Boehner's help. \"I'm not sure anyone has exercised that option to date,\" he said. Boehner's successor, Paul Ryan, has seen his once sky-high career prospects flounder in the Trump era. The 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee has occasionally criticized Trump, but he is retiring at the end of the year. In South Carolina, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford narrowly lost his June primary hours after Mr. Trump tweeted he had been \"very unhelpful\" and highlighted the congressman's extramarital affair. Days later, Sanford described Trumpism as \"a cancerous growth.\" As he prepares to leave Congress, he's warning the GOP the cancer is spreading. \"We have a president that will tell numerous dis-truths in the course of a day, yet that's not challenged,\" Sanford said in an interview. \"What's cancerous here is in an open political system, there has to be some measure of objective truth.\" \"I'm baffled by the way so many people have looked the other way,\" he said. Asked whether he feels like he fits in today's GOP, Sanford said simply, \"No.\" Back in Ohio, Borges vowed that his departure from politics was only temporary. \"The Trump phenomenon is going to end at some point in time. That might be six years, that might be two years, that might be sooner. No one knows,\" the former Ohio GOP chairman said. \"When it does end, it's the job of a lot of us ... to make sure that the party is still populated by good, honest, decent candidates and officeholders who we can continue to be proud of.\"",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Roberta Jacobson that aired Sunday, July 1, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan. Today voters across Mexico head to the ballot box to choose a new president. And in doing so, they're likely to send a strong message to those of us north of the border. Joining us to discuss the consequences is former U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson. Thank you for being here, ambassador. ROBERTA JACOBSON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO MEXICO: Thank you, Margaret. BRENNAN: The expected winner here, AMLO, as he's called, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is coming from the left wing party here in -- or really a party he's kind of paving the way for. But he's viewed as populist, sometimes described as kind of a left wing Donald Trump. And what do you think that his election could mean for relations with the U.S.? JACOBSON: Well, you know, one of the things that -- that he, both in my discussions with him and in many of his conversations and his advisers' conversations ahead of these elections have emphasized, is the importance of the relationship with the United States and that it be positive and that they're going to work hard on that, which does not mean that it's going to be easier than it has been with the current Mexican government. I think there are a number of issues on which it's going to be difficult and maybe harder. But he has been at pains to reassure people that he takes this relationship seriously, that he does not think that it needs to be descend into insults. And he has the leftist credentials to be able to stand up politely in a way that I think he's got the credibility to do that. BRENNAN: And he had such fiery rhetoric. I mean he's talked about hitting back at the elite and -- JACOBSON: Right. BRENNAN: Standing up to President Trump. A lot of the remarks the president has made over the past year have been very unpopular with people throughout Mexico. JACOBSON: Uniformly. It's one of the only things they agree on. BRENNAN: So what is at stake for Americans when it comes to this election? JACOBSON: Well, I think the most important thing that's at stake is whether we continue to cooperate and work with Mexico as partners. Whether you're talking about economically or on trade or on migration or on security, or whether that partnership that we've built over the last 30 years begins to deteriorate. BRENNAN: Well, the president describes it as already deteriorating. That Mexico is not doing its job at the border. That Mexico is sending drug dealers into the United States. He's used some pretty harsh language. JACOBSON: Uh-huh. And -- and that is not helping make this partnership any better. The fact is, the Mexican government currently in power -- and I expect certain aspects of Lopez Obrador's government to continue cooperation on things that are important to both countries. And that does include secure borders. It does include cooperating on narcotics. It also includes cooperating on people from outside the hemisphere who may be trying to enter the U.S. through Mexico. BRENNAN: That's the border crisis. JACOBSON: Well, but those are Central Americans. I'm talking about people who may be from all over the world, Middle East, south Asia. And we've had enormous cooperation with Mexico. So our own security depends on continuing that cooperation. And Mexico feels, quite rightly in many cases, that they've gotten almost no credit for that. BRENNAN: You left the foreign service after, what 30 years -- JACOBSON: Thirty-one years. BRENNAN: Thirty-one years as an American diplomat. You've served Democrats. You've served Republicans. JACOBSON: Right. BRENNAN: Why did you choose to leave the Trump administration? JACOBSON: Well, Mexico -- being ambassador to Mexico was my dream job. I was the assistant secretary for the region for five years before that. And I loved the work. I still love the work, but it became increasingly difficult to do under this administration because every time you try to do something on NAFTA or on security or on any of the most important issues to us, education, et cetera, things would get blown up by a tweet. And there were many people in government trying to do the right thing because this partnership is important to Americans and yet it just never seems that we could overcome the retreat into the vilification of Mexicans at a rally or a tweet. And that was really, really difficult. BRENNAN: So the president's own words, you're saying, made it hard to actually implement his policies? JACOBSON: Absolutely. BRENNAN: The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has taken a lead role in this relationship as well with the current government. In some ways bypassing diplomats like yourself. What does that mean with a new Mexican government? If he doesn't have someone at the end of the line who he's dear friends with like in the currently government, how do you build a bridge with this new, fiery populist who's coming into power? JACOBSON: You know what? My expectation is there's going to be a period -- Mexico has a very long transition period. It's five months. So that's a long time to get themselves organized in which we also will be trying to, in the administration, the U.S. government will be trying to get themselves organized and find out who the counterparts are. Will it go back to being foreign secretary to foreign secretary, which, with Mike Pompeo in the job at State, is much more probable, or will there be somebody close to Lopez Obrador that he'd like to put in the position to work with the White House directly? Having been in the State Department for 31 years, you can guess where my vote would be. I'd prefer to go back to institutional relationships that I think support and make the relationship stronger. But it's not clear to me that -- that this might not be a president in AMLO who likes the same thing. Who likes to find a trusted confidante and put that person in charge of the relationship. It's not clear. BRENNAN: Well, high stakes, as you laid out, for immigration, for border security. Thank you very much. JACOBSON: For our opioid crisis as well. BRENNAN: For our opioid crisis as well. JACOBSON: We need them as partners. Thank you. BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Ambassador Jacobson.",

            "article_content": "Changing demographics, the appeal of a fresh young female challenger, lack of face time at home \u2013 House Democrats found an abundance of reasons Wednesday to explain why the number four House Democrat, New York Rep. Joe Crowley,\u00a0lost his primary\u00a0to 28-year old self-described socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. What it's not, they said, is a sign of a party wide problem. \"It's because of a number of things but in 24 hours we do not have that analysis,\" Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said. \"That fact that in a very progressive district in New York went more\u2026to the left than Joe Crowley is about that district. It should be viewed as something that stands for everything else.\" When CBS News Chief Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes asked Pelosi about Republican claims that democratic socialism is ascendant in the party, she hotly contested it. \"It's ascendant in that district perhaps! But I don't accept any characterization of our party presented by the Republicans,\" she said. Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Kentucky, said his takeaway from the primary was, \"you don't want to run against a Democratic woman this year.\" He cited\u00a0Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot who beat the popular mayor of Lexington, Kentucky in the Democratic primary to challenge Rep. Andy Barr (R-Kentucky). \"She was a fresh face, she tapped into a lot of the new energy that's out there and I think that's what happened in Joe's district as well,\" he said. \"To that extent I think it represents something that we should benefit from as we move into the midterms, that there's a lot of energy out there that some of our fresh new faces will be able to tap into and take over some seats that we might not have otherwise have been able to take back.\" He said that his text message chain with about 25 members \"blew up\" as election results came in Tuesday night. \"I think it's two things: one is disappointment for Joe, stunned, and very curious about whether there's any takeaway,\" he said. \"But nobody has any answers.\" But Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn, R-South Carolina was ready with an answer. \"Joe is a great guy, but I don't think he paid enough attention to those constituents at home,\" he said Wednesday morning. Clyburn, like Pelosi, insisted that Crowley's defeat did not result form the simmering tensions between the mainstream wing of the Democratic party and those who fashion themselves in the mold of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, as Ocasio-Cortez did. She advocated for positions including a federal jobs guarantee and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, positions few of her future colleagues on Capitol Hill are fighting for. \"I don't think there is that kind of divide,\" Clyburn said when asked about the tension between the two wings of the party. \"I think that we all have\u2026our bases at home to protect. You don't get here without staying close touch with your districts so too often, we tend to forget that those of us in leadership have two sets of constituents. The first ones are the ones who elected you to this body and if you don't get to the body, you don't got no chance to anything else.\" Crowley's loss was quick to spark questions about who will succeed him as chairman of the Democratic caucus, a position that was expected to help him launch a bid for minority leader or even speaker one day. His number two at the caucus, Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-California, said she thought she would make a good caucus chair. \"Having said that I'm not making any announcements. I have yet to connect with Joe and I'll continue to reach out to members of the caucus, but again we are still processing and again, anything can happen so I'm not going to speculate,\" she said. Yarmuth said he believed she would enjoy broad support within the caucus if she ran, though it's unclear given her very narrow margin of victory for vice caucus chair when she was elected in 2016. Plus, Sanchez angered Democratic leadership when she said in an interview last year, \"I do think it's time to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders.\" Sanchez wouldn't speculate on whether Pelosi might become speaker in the fall, saying the first priority is to win back the House during the midterms. But her colleague, Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, told reporters Wednesday morning that if anything Crowley's race was a sign that it's far from guaranteed. \"We cannot take anything for granted this election year,\" she said. \"I refuse to say a Blue Wave is coming because it's not gonna come if we don't work hard every single day.\" Rebecca Kaplan covers the 2012 presidential campaign for CBS News and National Journal.",

            "article_content": "In spite of his early cash advantage, Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke\u00a0has been reminded plenty of times that he faces long odds of taking Sen. Ted Cruz's Senate seat from him. However he said he's listening to the people all across Texas and isn't taking anything for granted in the race for Senate. \"I'm running a grassroots campaign ... all across the state. We don't want to know what people outside of Texas say about our campaign. I want to listen to you ... you're a Texan, an American ... a human being is most important to me,\" O'Rourke told CBSN's Elaine Quijano in an interview Monday on \"Red & Blue.\" The 45-year-old Democratic Texas representative was first elected to the House in 2012 and officially became the first Democrat in Texas to file for the U.S. Senate race in late November 2017. Between Jan. 1 and Feb. 14, O'Rourke raised $2.3 million while former GOP presidential candidate Cruz raised just $800,000, according to the Federal Election Commission. \"I feel pretty confident,\" O'Rourke said. \"There's something I've never seen happening in Texas ... Republican, Democrat, Independent ... are getting off the sidelines and into the game ... they know that everything that matters to them and their families is on the line right now and they're getting involved. Turn out is up over 100 percent in the Democratic primaries so far during early voting and it's down in early Republican voting. This bodes well for what we're going to see in the November election, but we aren't taking anything for granted.\" O'Rourke added that his campaign is running without political action committees (PACs) and solely supported by the people he wants to represent. He mentioned that the average contribution for the O'Rourke campaign is $25. \"That the right way to win,\" he added. The school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14 that killed 17 people, sparked debates over what can be done by Congress to prevent other mass shootings.\u00a0President Trump has called for a ban on bump stocks -- the devices that turn semi-automatic rifles into automatic rifles -- and he has shifted focus of the debate away from guns toward the role mental health plays in mass violence. Mr. Trump has also floated the idea of potentially raising the age limit for purchase of semi-automatic weapons to a minimum age of 21 -- a limitation that the National Rifle Association (NRA) opposes. Suspected gunman Nikolas Cruz used an AR-15, an automatic weapon, in the Florida massacre. O'Rourke called out the leadership and the courage of the Parkland students and others across the U.S. that have stressed the need for change. \"They are done with the thoughts and prayers, they are demanding action and I think they are going to force it,\" he said. \"I think the opportunity is open to us -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- to move forward on allowing the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] to study gun violence, having universal background checks ... and banning the sale of assault weapons.\" \"It's going to take a lot of bipartisan work, but it's work that we have to begin now and we are going to be forced to do it by these kids who are the conscious of this country and display the courage that Congress is currently lacking,\" he added. O'Rourke said AR-15 style weapons were designed for the battlefield and \"they have no place in our streets and in our schools.\" Another polarizing issue facing Congress this year: What happens to the legal status of the roughly 800,000 so-called Dreamers part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy?\u00a0 Monday, the Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's appeal, which attempted to get SCOTUS to intervene in a lower court's order that requires the federal government to continue accepting DACA renewal applications. Allowing the legal battle to run its course in the courts means that Congress has more time beyond the original March 5 deadline to act. Two lower courts blocked the ending of DACA, and the decision has not yet been reviewed by an appeals court. \"I think it gives us more time to work -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- to make sure that not only those Dreamers are protected from deportation, but that they can contribute to their full potential as citizens,\" O'Rourke said. \"I also think we need to move forward with the 'original Dreamers' ... the parents of those Dreamers to make sure they are also able to stay in this country with their families and contribute to the success and safety of our communities and our country.\" Meanwhile, as O'Rourke wins the support of many Texas Democrats seeking an upset in the November 2018 midterm elections, Democratic congressional candidate Laura Moser, founder of the Resistance-style text message service \"Daily Action,\" has been openly scorned by her party. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) released an opposition research memo regarding Moser's fitness for office, which described her as \"a Washington insider, who begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for Congress.\" \"I don't think the DCCC, the DNC ... any of those in Washington D.C. have any place in our campaign or election in Texas,\" O'Rourke said. \"I think this is up for Texans to decide ... that's why I'm only listening to Texans and doing it in town hall meetings where we ask folks and to please show up.\" \"The fact that you're an American, a Texan, a human being ... matters most to me before we even think about party identification and certainly what any of the party bosses in Washington D.C. have to say about this,\" he added.

            "article_content": "Oxon Hill, Md. -- Broward County, Florida, came up in Eric Trump's speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday night just outside Washington, D.C. -- but not because of the high school shooting that left 17 dead last week.\u00a0 When Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk asked the president's second son to describe the 2016 campaign, and election night, Eric Trump recalled watching Florida go for his father, specifically mentioning Broward County, which voted for Hillary Clinton. Kirk and the president's second son reminisced about Donald Trump's unexpected ascendance to the White House Thursday night and accomplishments since then, focusing on everything from election night to tax reform -- and of course, Clinton.\u00a0 \"I saw more Hillary for prison signs in many of these places than Clinton for president signs,\" the Trump son said, recalling the election.\u00a0 But more difficult topics, such as the deaths in Florida and the debate that has ensued, staffing challenges in the White House and the path ahead for immigration did not come up Thursday night. President Trump has tackled some of those issues, hosting a listening session with students and families affected by school shootings Wednesday, and another listening session Thursday. The appearance of the 34-year-old Trump son comes hours before his father is slated to speak on the same stage Friday. He described how his family worked together during the campaign, even though they weren't political. He didn't know what a delegate was before his father entered politics, he said. \u00a0 \"We did work together very well as a family, we operated very well as a family,\" the Trump son said, describing the experience on the campaign.\u00a0 Eric Trump doesn't dabble in politics publicly quite as frequently as his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., or his sister, Ivanka Trump, who works in the White House. But he still makes occasional TV appearances, and his wife, Lara Trump, is the senior adviser to her father-in-law's 2020 reelection campaign. The CPAC annual gathering of conservative activists, has attracted some of the most outspoken pro-Trump speakers this year, such as Fox News' Judge Jeanine Pirro, former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka, Breitbart's London editor Raheem Kassam and NRA head Wayne LaPierre. While the White House is battling multiple fires on its own, the message at CPAC Thursday was one of praise for the president and accomplishments conservatives view as most important -- the tax overhaul, judicial nominees like Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, and regulatory changes.

            "article_content": "They're medical professionals and veterans, policy analysts and moms. They're taking on titans of the Republican Party or fighting to reform the Democratic Party from within. None of them are household names. But all of them are women who are stepping into the fray in 2018 and sending a strong message: Win or lose, the future for progressives is female. With all the talk about a potential Democratic wave in 2018, it would be far too easy to overlook the role of individual candidates working on the grassroots level. Yet the tens of thousands of women\u00a0who are weighing bids or have already announced a run for office in the Trump Era tells us plenty about both the moment we're in \u2013 and what we can expect from Democrats in years to come. Among the most exciting Democratic candidates to watch this year is an unlikely one: Amy McGrath, who is running for a Republican-held U.S. House seat in Kentucky. A former fighter pilot who was the first woman to fly an F-18 jet into combat, Lt. Col. McGrath quite literally blasted onto our screens with an inspiring announcement video recounting all the times she was told that, as a woman, she couldn't achieve her dreams.  Her message is at times anti-Mitch McConnell, at others anti-Donald Trump, and always about breaking through the noise and gridlock in Washington as an outsider who puts loyalty to country above all else. A native Kentuckian who regularly hits the campaign trail balancing one of her three children on her hip, she speaks with authenticity about issues ranging from Trump's proposed ban on transgender people serving in the military, to the need for the Affordable Care Act and the impact that rolling back the Dodd-Frank financial reforms would have on working people.  Above all, her profile as a woman who has spent her career breaking down gender stereotypes and rising above institutionalized obstacles fits this moment of female empowerment so seamlessly, it may even put her over the top in a state where Trump remains popular and in a district he carried handily. In the heartland, anti-bullying advocate Marie Newman has been making headlines for taking on fellow Illinois Democrat Dan Lipinski, who earned the ire of progressive groups including the Human Rights Campaign,\u00a0NARAL Pro-Choice America, and MoveOn.org for being the only House Democrat to vote against the Affordable Care Act and his consistent opposition to Planned Parenthood funding. Just a couple of districts away in the Chicago suburbs, registered nurse, former Obama administration official, and literal Girl Scout Lauren Underwood has also made safeguarding access to affordable care a centerpiece of her campaign.  Both Newman and Underwood are running underdog campaigns against entrenched male incumbents. And in the wake of repeated attacks on Obamacare, they believe their opponents' efforts to take health care away from millions of Americans -- including their own constituents -- will motivate women voters and become a central factor in who wins the elections this year. Meanwhile, the Lone Star State has also drawn some new blood. Gina Ortiz-Jones, an alumna of the Obama administration, is challenging GOP Rep. Will Hurd in a major swing district along the southern border. Hurd won the last election by just 3,051 votes, or 1.3 percent, and the seat has flipped from blue to red and red to blue repeatedly over the last several cycles.  Ortiz-Jones, a gay former Air Force intelligence officer who served under the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy, has positioned herself as an expert on foreign policy and a standout voice on defending health care access at a time when both issues have taken center stage. Her underdog campaign has been lauded by national groups, including Emily's List and a host of LGBT advocacy organizations. And like Underwood, she was among the women featured on Time Magazine's January 29 cover as one of\u00a0\"The Avengers\"\u00a0taking on Washington. In decidedly more Democratic friendly turf on the West Coast, Mai Khanh Tran has thrown her hat in the ring in California's 39th Congressional District, one of the many Republican-held seats that voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016. A pediatrician who was just nine years old when she came to the United States on her own at the close of the Vietnam War, Tran's personal story is a compelling encapsulation of the American Dream, just as immigration reform has returned to center of our national discourse. Given her history, Tran offers real world experience on an issue currently facing millions of American families.  Tran speaks eloquently\u00a0about how her background in medicine informs her politics, and what it means to be a working mom at a time women are under more pressure than ever before to \"have it all and do it all.\" With the recent decision by Rep. Ed Royce, one of the longest-serving Republicans on Capitol Hill, to retire from the seat he has held for 13 terms, Democrats have a very good chance of taking the district this fall. What unites all of these women is a common story about being called to serve in response to what they're witnessing from the White House and Congress, which are actively working to disassemble the programs and policies millions of women hold dear. The fresh faces of the Democratic Party this year aren't looking to 2020; they're planning to storm the House in 2018. They're running for office just as women's voices may hold more power than they have in a generation. And if they win in November, they will play a key part in shaping policy for the\u00a0next\u00a0generation. Across all of their campaigns, these women are staking out unequivocal positions on everything from health care to income inequality. At times, they are turning gender norms upside down and breaking new ground simply through the images they project to voters, which is what Maryland gubernatorial candidate\u00a0Krish Vignarajah\u00a0did by announcing her candidacy with her husband by her side holding their new baby. For so many women candidates this year, 2017 was an awakening. Here's hoping that for most, 2018 is just the beginning.

            "article_content": "government shutdownIn a Denver co-working space between a brewpub and a shop serving the Hawaiian raw fish salad called poke, four possible independent candidates for U.S. Senate and governorships recently plotted how to pry loose Republicans' and Democrats' grip on U.S. politics. Terry Hayes, Maine's treasurer and a possible gubernatorial candidate, left the Democratic Party over its domination by teachers' unions. Craig O'Dear, a Kansas City lawyer exploring a challenge to Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, was active in the GOP but became disillusioned with both parties. Bob Krist decided to run for Nebraska governor as an independent because Republican activists and the GOP incumbent injected partisanship into the state's nonpartisan Legislature. Following this week's government shutdown and the 2016 election, in which both parties nominated historically unpopular candidates, there's new energy in the movement to reclaim the political center. Alaska Gov. Bill Walker is a former Republican turned political independent. (AP Photo/Mark Thiessen, File) Groups report surging interest and are targeting statehouses and Senate races, raising money to protect a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives bloc and laying groundwork for a 2020 independent presidential bid. \"I look around and see a bunch of other ships in the water, rowing in the same direction,\" said Charlie Wheelan, a Dartmouth College political scientist who founded The Centrist Project, which hosted December's Denver meeting. The two major parties are hemorrhaging members and more voters identify as independent than as Democratic or Republican, according to the Washington D.C.-based Pew Research Center, which measures public opinion. Acrimony between Democrats and Republicans great enough that moderates in the two parties only reached a deal to keep government open on Monday, two days after it had closed \u2014 and that deal expires in two weeks. But, while voters express disgust with the parties, they've never embraced them more tightly. Every 2016 U.S. Senate race was won by the party that won that state's presidential vote \u2014 for the first time in U.S. history. Polls show the more involved people are in politics, the more likely they hold extreme ideological views. \"We're just seeing the two coalitions move farther and farther apart,\" said Jocelyn Kiley, the Pew center's associate research director. \"There are actually fewer people now who hold a mix of liberal and conservative views.\" The anti-partisan groups acknowledge they're fighting powerful trends but say the alternative is accepting that U.S. politics will just get worse. The eight-year-old No Labels group is launching a SuperPAC to defend members of its Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of House Republicans and Democrats who started meeting last summer in hopes of getting bipartisan legislation through a Congress whose Republican leaders pushed a GOP-only tax bill and last year's unsuccessful health bill. Executive Director Nancy Jacobson there must be muscle and money behind good government preaching. \"If you can't match the political forces of the left and right, you'll never have a center,\" Jacobson said. The caucus has delved into health care, infrastructure and immigration. Co-chairs, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-New Jersey, and Rep. Tom Reed, R-New York, are optimistic about bipartisan legislation because the Senate has already used all its opportunities for 51-vote, party-line legislation. \"You've got a lot of governing that can get done,\" Reed said. The Serve America Movement based itself in Colorado partly because the state is evenly divided between Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters. It's surveying people in Kansas \u2014 a conservative state with a high number of unaffiliated voters \u2014 to determine what they want in an independent presidential candidate. \"We're building an infrastructure for whatever candidate rises,\" said chief executive officer Sarah Lenti. The Centrist Project \u2014 which just renamed itself Unite America \u2014 has now moved to an office for the 2018 elections, only a few miles from the Serve America Movement. Dominick Scafidi, in charge of field and digital operations, gestures during a brainstorming session at the Unite America office in Denver. (AP Photo/Thomas Peipert) The group was drawn by Colorado's evenly-divided state legislature. Democrats control the state House, but Republicans the Senate by a single vote. The group plans to field several nonpartisan state senate candidates, hoping to elect a bloc that can control policy, and has announced challengers to three Democrats and one Republican. Unite America wants to get involved in another half-a-dozen or so state races this year elsewhere with its $1 million bankroll. Along with Hayes and Krist, the group is backing businessman Greg Orman, who announced Wednesday a nonpartisan bid for Kansas governor. Neal Simon, a Baltimore businessman, is exploring a nonpartisan run against Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin in Maryland. Unite America is also recruiting in Texas and Wyoming Senate races. Independent candidacies can create electoral surprises. The last open Maine gubernatorial race with a prominent nonpartisan candidate, in 2010, led to the election of Republican Gov. Paul LePage, a Trump precursor. In Kansas, Democrats fear Orman could split the gubernatorial vote and elect Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who chaired Trump's disbanded voter fraud commission. Kansas Independent Senate candidate Greg Orman delivers a concession speech to supporters in 2014. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File) Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said the main impact of independents is usually to throw an election to a major party. The GOP has taken partisanship to such an extreme that the only way to stop it is for the party to lose control of Congress, he said. \"In the short run,\" Ornstein said of Republicans alienated by the GOP, \"those voters have to vote for Democrats.\" That theory gained little traction around the conference table in Denver. \"If a party can't nominate a candidate who can win in a multicandidate race, why is that on me?\" Hayes said.",

            "article_content": "AUSTIN, Texas -- When it comes to a 2020 presidential run, Beto O'Rourke is still playing hard to get - even as the buzz around him intensifies. The three-term Democratic congressman murmured \"No decision. No decision on that,\" when pressed by an attendee during a town hall Friday in his native El Paso who playfully demanded: \"You're going to run for president, right?\"  A onetime punk rocker, O'Rourke became a political star in national liberal circles, raised $80-plus million and came within three percentage points of upsetting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz to become the first Democrat to win statewide office in Texas in nearly a quarter century. The 46-year-old is giving up his House seat and has said he'll wait until he finishes his term Jan. 3 before making up his mind on 2020.\u00a0 O'Rourke told \"60 Minutes\" before the election \"the answer is no\" if he would run for president in 2020, win or lose. A MoveOn 2020 straw poll released earlier this week had O'Rourke leading the list of potential candidates.\u00a0 Amid his indecision, O'Rourke's name has continued to rise among top potential Democratic presidential candidates - even climbing to at or near the top in some opinion polls.\u00a0 Later asked at the town hall about the \"immense pressure\" the eventual Democratic presidential nominee competing with President Trump and his combative campaigning style could face to refrain from going negative, O'Rourke said \"interesting, speculative question.\"\u00a0 \"Whoever is running may very well be running against somebody who has not the slightest respect for our norms, our traditions, civility, dignity, decency and public life,\" O'Rourke said. \"Where you can say anything that you want to from the highest perch of power in this land.\"  He continued of 2020: \"This is the mother of all tests for this democracy and whether we can run a campaign, have candidates at all levels from schoolboard to the White House who are willing to focus on issues, on our potential, on our promise, on the future instead of our fears, instead of attacking one another personally, instead of going for the most base impulse and instincts among us.\"\u00a0 O'Rourke said his decision wouldn't be affected by fellow Texas Democrat Julian Castro's announcement earlier this week that he is exploring a run for president, the Texas Tribune reports. \"I think it's something positive for the United States that he can offer and share ideas,\" O'Rourke said about Castro. Castro formerly wasa the mayor of San Antonio and also served as the secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Obama. \u00a0 O'Rourke said he hasn't ruled anything out for 2020, including challenging Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas.\u00a0  O'Rourke, whose populist brand of optimism was a hit with many Texas voters, said he had planned to make Friday his last day in Congress and spend it packing up his belongings and heading back to Texas. Instead, though, he's planning to return to Capitol Hill next week for discussions on passing federal spending bills \"because the government will run out of money on Dec. 21\" unless Congress acts.  Mr. Trump has vowed to help force a government shutdown unless funding to expand the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is approved - something O'Rourke calls inhumane and ineffective.  \"I will vote against any budget proposal that comes forward that adds to the already 600 miles of walls and fencing and physical barriers that we have in this country,\" he said.  \"Not only is it a waste of your money at a time that we are $21 trillion in debt, but we are projected to add $1 trillion in deficit spending to that debt just in this next fiscal year.\"  O'Rourke crossed into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, later Friday and headed to an immigration shelter to mingle with men, women and children, mostly from Central America, who want to claim asylum in the United States because they are fleeing violence or political persecution back home. Most said they have been forced to wait days - and assigned numbers scribbled on their arms - before being allowed to reach border crossings and formally make such claims.  \"We're here to understand your story and to see how we can help you seek asylum in our country,\" O'Rourke said in Spanish to a group from Guatemala.  Advocates O'Rourke spoke to at the shelter accused the U.S. of effectively \"rationing asylum,\" arguing that authorities are deliberately slow-playing the process. They say families sometimes give up waiting and try to cross illegally, only to be captured and face potential criminal charges.  Speaking to reporters upon returning to El Paso, O'Rourke repeated that he wasn't ready to make a 2020 decision, noting that he didn't expect presidential race talk to heat up so far from the election. He added that he may have a better idea of his next move after \"everything settles,\" perhaps after the end of the year.  On Saturday, O'Rourke is touring Tornillo, the tent city about 30 miles outside El Paso, where 2,300 immigrant teens are being held at what began as an emergency shelter but now is taking on a permanent feel - costing taxpayers up to $1,200 per child, per day.",

            "article_content": "President Trump spoke in Kansas City, Missouri, Friday afternoon for the 2018 Project Safe Neighborhoods National Conference organized by the Justice Department. His speech came hours after he announced changes in his Cabinet, including tapping William Barr to be attorney general. Barr previously served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush. Mr. Trump touted the Project Safe Neighborhoods, spearheaded by George W. Bush Attorney General John Ashcroft, which brings together law enforcement and community leaders who work together to combat violent crime. \"After many years of neglect, we are bringing back this life-saving program, stronger than ever before,\" Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump also praised Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, who recently won a Senate election. The president joked that too often, candidates look good, but then\"they choke like dogs.\" Hawley, he said, was not that kind of candidate. \"He had a tough race against a very tough competitor, and he was absolutely fantastic,\" Mr. Trump said. He also complained about how the \"fake news\" was more focused on Democrats taking the majority in the House than Republicans expanding their majority in the Senate. \"Nobody ever talks about the Senate! We won the Senate easily,\" Mr. Trump said. In his speech, Mr. Trump primarily focused on supporting law enforcement. He discussed bringing back the death penalty for \"cop-killers.\" \"For me it's not even a little bit controversial. You kill a cop, you get the death penalty,\" he said. He also railed against Democrats for supporting \"open borders,\" and called for greater support for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and funding for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. \"Congress must fully fund border security in the year-end funding bill,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I actually think the politics are very bad for them,\" he added about Democrats. Congressional Democrats remain opposed to providing funding for the wall, which could lead to a government shutdown at the end of the year. If confirmed, Barr will replace Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who was appointed by the president in November after he ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Several Democrats raised concerns about Whitaker because of his past criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Whitaker is currently overseeing the investigation. Mr. Trump talked to reporters before boarding Air Force One to travel to Missouri on Friday morning. The president called Barr a \"terrific person\" and a \"brilliant man.\" \"He was my first choice from day one,\" Mr. Trump said about Barr. Mr. Trump also officially named current State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert to replace Nikki Haley as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. on Friday. A former host for Fox News, Nauert joined the administration last year. \"I am pleased to announce that Heather Nauert, Spokeswoman for the United States Department of State, will be nominated to serve as United Nations Ambassador,\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Friday. CBS News' Major Garrett has reported that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly's departure is imminent. When he spoke to reporters, Mr. Trump made no mention of Kelly. He did say that he would likely make an announcement about joint chiefs of staff leadership over the weekend. Mr. Trump's trip to Kansas City also comes amid developments in the special counsel investigation. Mueller is expected to file memos on former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on Friday. Mr. Trump began his Friday with a Twitter tirade lashing out against Mueller and his investigation. \"Robert Mueller and Leakin' Lyin' James Comey are Best Friends, just one of many Mueller Conflicts of Interest,\" Mr. Trump wrote in one tweet. Comey is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee Friday. Mr. Trump is expected to travel to Philadelphia tomorrow for the Army-Navy football game.

            "article_content": "LOS ANGELES --\u00a0Alex Villanueva scored an upset win Monday in the race for Los Angeles County sheriff, making Jim McDonnell the first incumbent to lose the seat in more than a century. Villanueva, a retired sheriff's lieutenant, proclaimed victory last week. But McDonnell had declined to concede, saying he would wait for all the votes to be counted in the contest to lead the nation's largest sheriff's department. He finally admitted defeat Monday after updated election results showed Villanueva leading by nearly 126,000 votes with only 100,000 ballots left to be counted, according to City News Service. McDonnell promised an orderly transition of power in a statement released Monday, nearly three weeks after the Nov. 6 election. Villanueva is expected to be sworn in next week to lead the department, which has been plagued by scandal in recent years. Former Sheriff Lee Baca was convicted in 2017 of obstructing an FBI investigation into corrupt and violent guards who took bribes to smuggle contraband into the jails he ran and savagely beat inmates.  McDonnell highlighted his efforts to combat serious assaults by deputies in jails, the issue that led to Baca's resignation in 2014 amid the corruption investigation, reports the Los Angeles Times. But Villanueva campaigned to \"clean house,\" arguing not enough reform was made under McDonnell, reports CBS Los Angeles. He had the backing of the Los Angeles Democratic Party and the Association of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, the union representing rank-and-file deputies.\u00a0 He also had the backing of an immigrant rights group after he vowed to kick U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials out of the county's massive jail system, reports the Los Angeles Times. Jurisdictions across the country have faced controversy when it comes to cooperation with ICE over inmates flagged for deportation. The Times reports that Villanueva would still honor ICE's request to detain inmates convicted of serious crimes, however, as the department does now. Both McDonnell and Villanueva are veteran law enforcement officers, reports CBS Los Angeles. Villanueva spent three decades with the LASD before retiring earlier this year, while McDonnell was with the Los Angeles Police Department for 29 years \u2014 including as second-in-command to then-chief Bill Bratton \u2014 before going on to lead the Long Beach Police Department and then being elected sheriff in 2014. McDonnell had the endorsement of at least four of the five county supervisors who control his budget and had the support of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, former Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, and Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey. \"The honor of serving as the LA County Sheriff is one like no other in law enforcement,\" McDonnell said in a statement. \"The Sheriff will be immediately faced with a range of very complex issues that go to the heart of maintaining public safety and public trust.\"",

            "article_content": "House Republicans voted on Wednesday to make current House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy the minority leader by a wide margin, 159 to 43, in their leadership elections for the 116th Congress. McCarthy was challenged by Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch conservative and prominent member of the Freedom Caucus. Rep. Steve Scalise won a unanimous vote to become minority whip. Current House Speaker Paul Ryan is retiring after this term, which left the minority leader post up for grabs. McCarthy was widely believed to be the favorite, but Jordan had some allies on the far right in the House. A few dozen members comprise the Freedom Caucus, which was instrumental in the ousting of former House Speaker John Boehner in 2015. McCarthy briefly ran to replace Boehner, but soon withdrew his candidacy, in part due to opposition from more conservative members of the Republican conference. McCarthy has taken a harder line on issues such as immigration in recent weeks. He\u00a0proposed a bill last month to provide full funding to build the border wall between the United States and Mexico, a campaign promise and passion project for President Trump. Scalise was considering running for House speaker if Republicans kept their majority, but opted to stay in his current post as whip. McCarthy and Scalise will remain in their current positions as majority leader and majority whip, respectively, until the new Congress is seated in January. Democrats hold their vote on leadership positions later this month. Several other positions were decided by unanimous voice vote: Rep. Liz Cheney was elected GOP conference chair, Rep. Mark Walker was elected GOP conference vice chair, Rep. Tom Emmer was election chair of the National Republican Campaign Committee, and Rep. Jason Smith was elected GOP conference secretary. Rep. Gary Palmer defeated Rep. David Schweikert to become Republican Policy Committee chair. All of the newly elected members of Republican House leadership are white, and only one, Cheney, is female.

            "article_content": "LONDON -- Prime Minister Theresa May has managed to hash out a draft agreement with the European Union on the terms of Britain's looming divorce from the EU, and to convince her own divided cabinet that the deal is a better than the default alternative -- a \"no-deal Brexit.\"\u00a0 May emerged from her official residence at No. 10 Downing Street in London on Wednesday evening after a five-hour, \"detailed and impassioned debate\" to say her cabinet had taken a \"decisive step\" in the Brexit process. Her government still needs the British Parliament, and all other EU member states, to sign off on the deal.  May's government or the EU were expected to make the full details of the draft Brexit      proposal public this week.    May's negotiating team handed its 500-page proposal over to cabinet members earlier on Wednesday, after they finally nailed down an agreement with EU counterparts on what has proved the most contentious issue; keeping the border between Northern Ireland (which is Britain) and Ireland (which is Europe) open and unrestricted.\u00a0 The  proposal from May's team would, according to details leaked to British  media, temporarily keep the entire U.K. within the European customs  union, in exchange for the EU allowing the Irish border to remain free  of physical barriers or checkpoints. That key tradeoff means Britain  would still, for an unclear period, be subject to the EU's collective  trade rules.  The  trade union mandates tariff-free movement of goods across national  boundaries within the bloc, and sets standardized rates for imports from  outside the EU. It also sets dozens of other rules for trade within the  EU. It has taken more than two years of agonizing negotiations in Brussels, set in motion by the 2016 public referendum result demanding the U.K. leave the European bloc, to get to this point. With her cabinet's backing secured, May must now win over even more skeptics in her own party.  Many in the divided Conservative Party believe her proposal leaves Europe with too much control over Britain's trade and borders, certainly if the U.K. remains for any considerable period part of the bloc's customs union. More philosophically, and perhaps more importantly from a public perpective, they argue that such a deal would betray the British public's will after the majority vote to leave the EU.  She insists her proposal delivers on key promises to reduce Europe's checks on British trade and immigration.  \"We will deliver Brexit. We will not rerun the referendum,\" she vowed on the floor of the British Parliament on Wednesday. She has framed the choice that faced her senior aides, and which now faces the British Parliament, in stark terms: accept her deal with the EU, which she says is the best one Britain could possibly attain, or reject it and leave Britain susceptible to as-yet-unclear consequences when the divorce happens anyway on March 29, as stipulated by EU rules. Experts, politicians and pundits have warned for months that such a \"no-deal\" Brexit could cripple trade and the flow of essential goods into Britain, given that the kingdom would suddenly have no trade agreements in place with its most vital trading partner; the other 27 members of the European Union. What May does not often discuss in public is the third option: a rejection of her Brexit proposal, and her leadership entirely.  If enough senior members of May's party balk at the deal, it could still lead to a challenge for the leadership of the party. In Britain's version of democracy, that means she could theoretically be unseated as Prime Minister and her entire government replaced through a snap election.  (Put simply, in the U.K. the public elects a party to lead the government, rather than a single person to lead the executive branch, as in the U.S. Party leaders are elected internally, and the leader of the party which wins a majority of seats in Parliament [when there is a clear majority] serves as prime minister.) A senior party member warned hardline Conservative \"Brexiteers\" on Wednesday, that if they fail to back May's proposal, it could backfire on them. Former Conservative Party leader William Hague, who voted to \"Remain\" in the 2016 referendum, said the public's decision must now be respected, and warned that rejecting May's proposal in hopes of a better deal would be inherently risky: \"If you don't take this opportunity to leave the EU, to get Brexit over the line, you might never leave at all,\" he told BBC's Radio 4. That last remark from Hague was an acknowledgement of a growing movement in the U.K. -- in the public and among lawmakers from all major parties, including some Conservatives -- for a second public referendum on any Brexit deal eventually agreed on by Parliament.\u00a0 Both left-leaning British lawmakers who never wanted to leave the EU, and some ardent backers of the vote to \"Leave\" have pushed for a second referendum, albeit with starkly different motivations.  While the Brexiteers are hoping another vote would bolster the mandate for a \"hard\" Brexit (a clean break, with the U.K. leaving all EU customs and trade agreements), many \"Remainers\" believe a second referendum could see the British public completely reverse its 2016 decision and reject any Brexit at all. The EU has left open the possibility of a British reversal. Remainers point to polls which show a shift in opinion over the last two years, during which time the Brexit movement has been accused of lying about the potential benefits and pitfalls of a divorce from the EU -- and breaking Britain's election laws -- during the bitter campaign ahead of the first referendum.  Hague suggested on Wednesday that if May's cabinet had failed to back her proposal, \"it would probably mean a different government.\"\u00a0 With the cabinet's backing secured, any potential challenges appeared to be staved off on Wednesday, at least for the time being, But senior members of May's cabinet have already left over her handling of the entire Brexit negotiations, including lead Brexit campaigner and former London Mayor Boris Johnson. If anyone from within the Conservative Party was to stage a challenge to May for leadership, his name is high in the betting odds.  The terms of the divorce still need to be agreed not only by Britain's Parliament (and possibly the public if a second referendum is called), but also by the governments of all 27 other EU member states. If a deal is not finalized and put in place by March 29, the British withdrawal from the EU will be triggered automatically (no-deal Brexit) and all standing trade agreements between Britain and the EU will end. Britain's trade with all non-EU nations is also currently controlled to a large degree by EU regulations -- it also currently benefits from the collective bargaining power of membership in the 28-member bloc. Broad World Trade Organization rules would apply under that scenario, but without specific deals in place, economists say the cost of trade for the U.K. would increase significantly, at least until new agreements are reached.

            "article_content": "Jeff Sessions has been forced out as attorney general. \"At your request, I am submitting my resignation,\" Sessions wrote to the president Wednesday. \u00a0President Trump tweeted the news, writing, \"We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!\"\u00a0 A senior Justice Department official said White House chief of staff John Kelly called Sessions to request his resignation. The president did not call him. A senior White House official told CBS News that the president had been \"itching to pull this trigger\" since before the midterm elections, but held off on the urging of Senate GOP leadership and senior White House advisers. Sessions has repeatedly come under attack by Mr. Trump for recusing himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.   Matthew G. Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff, will now become acting attorney general, and he will also oversee the Russia investigation that the president often refers to as a \"witch hunt.\" Before Whitaker joined to the Justice Department, he wrote an\u00a0opinion piece for CNN\u00a0in August 2017 criticizing the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller.\u00a0 Whitaker argued that Mueller should not be able to investigate the Trump family's finances in the course of his probe. \"It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel,\" Whitaker wrote. \"Any investigation into President Trump's finances or the finances of his family\u00a0would require\u00a0Mueller to return to Rod Rosenstein for additional authority under Mueller's appointment as special counsel,\" Whitaker also wrote in the CNN piece in 2017. Whitaker issued a statement Wednesday night calling it a \"true honor\" to be chosen by Mr. Trump.\u00a0 \"I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, \u00a0that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans,\" Whitaker said. \"I will work with our colleagues in Federal, State, local, and tribal leadership, including our partners in law enforcement and our U.S. Attorneys, to ensure the safety of all Americans and the security of the nation.\" Earlier Wednesday at the president's news conference, CBS News' Major Garrett had asked about potential changes in his Cabinet, in particular, whether Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would remain with the administration.\u00a0 The president didn't offer a direct answer, saying only, \"We're looking at different people for different positions.\" He added that he is mostly \"extremely happy\" with his Cabinet. In his resignation letter, Sessions touted the department's initiatives, saying that the Justice Department had taken on \"transnational gangs that are bringing violence and death across our borders and protected national security\" and noted efforts on immigration enforcement and the opioid epidemic.

Their mission is to keep caravans of Central Americans out.  CBS News' Mireya Villarreal saw the steady stream of military vehicles in one south Texas border town. Where a week ago there was an empty field, there's now at least 300 troops. The soldiers are there as back up for Customs and Border Patrol agents. Army specialists said their first big task is to help reinforce the ports of entry with new barbed wire fencing. They said they won't be going out on patrol. President Trump sent the troops to the border as part of Operation Faithful Patriot. Mr. Trump has blasted illegal immigration in the past, and called for the importance of border security. But the caravan has become a frequent topic at his rallies leading up to the midterm elections, and the president has also threatened to cut off aid to some Central American countries for failing to stop the migrants. The bulk of that caravan is at a stadium near Mexico City, more than 650 miles away. There are reports that this deployment could cost upwards of $200 million. Some people living in the area are calling the move a midterm election stunt. But border patrol and local law enforcement say this is a dangerous area exploited by smugglers, so they welcome the help.",

            "article_content": "Ohio Republican state Attorney General Mike DeWine is hoping to get a last minute push from President Trump at a rally in Cleveland, one day before the midterm elections. DeWine is in the midst of a tough race for governor against Democrat Richard Cordray, who served as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under former President Barack Obama. President Trump has been talking a lot about immigration ahead of the midterms, but reporter Jessie Balmert of The Cincinnati Enquirer told CBSN that in Ohio, the focus will be on the economy and keeping Republicans in control. There's already a Republican governor and state legislature.  He noted that DeWine hasn't been either a strong supporter of the president or a vocal critic, like fellow Republican Gov. John Kasich. \"You have people who like John Kasich, you have people who like Donald Trump, and I think Mike DeWine wants voters from both parties to vote for him and so I think it's a little bit of an awkward spot for him trying to appeal to both groups of people,\" Balmert said. On the Democratic side, Cordray has aligned himself with Obama. He's also gotten support from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who campaigned for him last week. But like his competitor, he hasn't positioned himself as an outspoken critic of the president. \"He's saying he would work with the president when it makes sense for Ohio and he wouldn't when it doesn't make sense for Ohio,\" Balmert said. \"You see a lot of focus on the independent voters or those middle-of-the-road voters in Ohio because both campaigns are trying to pick them up right now.\" Balmert said President Trump will be a key issue for Ohio voters, whether they like him or not. But like in many states, health care could be the biggest issue for voters at the polls. Kasich expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which Cordray supports. DeWine has said he would seek to reform Medicaid expansion, and supports adding work requirements. ",

That's the underlying message in her new ad, \"Hunt,\" released Tuesday, which highlights her devotion to New Mexico's public lands. \"We know what we need for a shot at a brighter future,\" Torres Small said in the ad, which depicts her loading and shooting a gun on a hunting trip. \"Because out here makes the squabbles in Washington seem small.\" Here's the ad: The ad is a departure from the issue-based ads focused on immigration, health care and water rights Torres Small, a water rights attorney, has released during her campaign. She told CBS News in a phone interview that hunting is personal to her, helping to forge a stronger connection with her husband. Hunting is a family tradition, too -- both her grandfather and father were hunters. \"It's also just a source of what centers me,\" Torres Small said. \"It reminds me of the things that I love about New Mexico and frankly, why I'm doing this.\" She even delayed her honeymoon after getting married to hunt with her father and husband. The early morning hunting trips, she said, allow you to take in \"the silence of feeling the world wake up.\" Torres Small also asserts in the ad, which has a six-figure ad buy, that New Mexicans want to see politicians deliver on their promises. \"New Mexicans don't care which party gets the credit or the blame,\" Torres Small added in the ad. \"We just want someone to deliver.\" Historically, the Second Congressional District has been a Republican stronghold, with a couple of exceptions over the past few decades. Democrats Harold L. Runnels was elected to the seat in 1970 and Harry Teague was elected to the seat in 2008. But outside of that, the 2nd CD has sent Republicans to Congress.\u00a0 In the 2016 presidential election, President Trump won this district by 10 points. Torres Small is running against Republican state Rep. Yvette Herrell, who was endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in May. After receiving the endorsement, Herrell released an\u00a0ad\u00a0in May noting her endorsement from the NRA and Gun Owners of America. FEC filing records ending on June 30 show the NRA Political Victory Fund donated $2,000 to Herrell's campaign. \"This commercial is yet another attempt by Xochitl Torres-Small to confuse and mislead voters,\" said Rob Burgess, a senior adviser to Herrell's campaign, in a statement. \"Voters across the 2nd District are intelligent and can see through this smoke screen. Furthermore, voters know that Yvette Herrell is the only candidate endorsed by the NRA and the Gun Owners of America.\" Still, Torres Small may have some advantages that have helped her close the gap with Herrell. According to New Mexico's Secretary of State Office, there are more Democrats than Republicans registered in the district. She has also raised more money for this race than Herrell, according to FEC filing records. Though she's reaching out to disaffected Republicans and independents with an ad like this, Torres Small says she's hoping to ride an \"engagement wave\" in New Mexico, which would spur some of those registered Democrats to come out and vote on Election Day.

            "article_content": "Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican opponent Josh Hawley faced off in their first debate Friday afternoon. The two spent much of the debate attacking each other, with Hawley finishing several answers by calling McCaskill a \"Washington liberal\" out of touch with Missouri values. Both candidates emphasized their relationships with President Trump, with Hawley embracing Trump talking points on immigration and other issues, and McCaskill trying to assert her independence from both the president and the Democrats. \"I'm the only candidate in this race that has a proven track record of bipartisan accomplishments,\" McCaskill said. \"What Missourians want is a senator who hasn't forgotten where he's from,\" Hawley said in his opening statement. He accused McCaskill of being a partisan actor and an antagonist to Mr. Trump, who won Missouri by 19 points in 2016. McCaskill is considered to be one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in the Senate this year. The two candidates sparred over topics such as whether they would confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, whether they support insurance covering patients with pre-existing conditions, and tariffs. McCaskill repeated throughout the debate that she had voted for two-thirds of Mr. Trump's judicial nominees, although not his previous nominee to the Supreme Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch. McCaskill has not said how she will vote on Kavanaugh's nomination. In turn, Hawley called out McCaskill for voting to confirm all of President Barack Obama's \"liberal\" judges, and disparaged what he saw as judicial activism. \"I'm concerned that judges too often impose their own values from the bench,\" Hawley said. \"It's almost always the liberal, left wing, Hollywood media values that get imposed.\" McCaskill slammed a lawsuit brought by Hawley, the state's attorney general and 19 other GOP attorneys general, saying it would strip away consumer protections under the Affordable Care Act. This claim has been rated as \"true\" by fact-checkers in Missouri, although Hawley repeatedly said that he supported health coverage for people with preexisting conditions. \"I will never support taking away health insurance for those with preexisting conditions,\" he said in the debate.\u00a0 But the GOP attorneys general are suing to have the ACA -- which requires coverage of pre-existing conditions -- declared unconstitutional, since the Republican-passed tax law included a provision that repealed the tax penalty levied on individuals who do not have health insurance. Because the penalty was removed, Republicans are arguing that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and therefore, so is the health care law. On tariffs, Hawley also sides with the president. \"It's a trade war that China started,\" he said, adding, \"If we're in a war, I want to be winning it.\" McCaskill's view is that the tariffs are not having the desired effect. \"Hurting Missouri farmers and manufacturing is the wrong way to do it,\" she said of using tariffs to win the trade war. \"Missouri agriculture is the most important part of our economy.\" Hawley fought back by criticizing McCaskill's husband for not releasing his tax returns, although he did not say whether Mr. Trump should release his tax returns. While Hawley tried to paint her as a swamp creature of Washington, McCaskill attempted to highlight her bipartisan accomplishments in the Senate. \"I will work with anybody, anytime if I can get something done for Missouri families, and the way you do that is by finding common ground,\" McCaskill said. In his closing statement, Hawley said the Senate race was a \"choice between the heartland way of life and a radical left-wing agenda.\" The two candidates were joined onstage by Green Party candidate Jo Crain and independent Craig O'Dear, who is trying to attract votes from citizens tired of partisan gridlock in Washington.

            "article_content": "CHEMNITZ, Germany -- The governor of Germany's eastern state of Saxony visited Thursday the city where anger over the suspected killing of a man by migrants sparked violent protests. Police were preparing for further demonstrations during the trip to Chemnitz by Governor Michael Kretschmer, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. At least 18 people were injured Monday when far-right protesters, mobilized from surrounding areas and further afield, clashed with counter-protesters in the city center. The demonstration followed calls on social media to honor a 35-year-old German citizen stabbed to death Sunday in an altercation. Authorities denied online rumors that the victim had been protecting a woman from harassment, saying there was no evidence this had been the case. Still, the public display of anger and footage showing neo-Nazis hurling abuse and bottles at counter-protesters as police struggled to keep the groups apart raised fresh concerns about the threat posed by far-right extremists in Germany. Saxony has long been a hotbed of anti-migrant sentiment and is home to the group Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West, or PEGIDA, as well as a stronghold of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which received almost a quarter of the vote in the state last year. There have been regular attacks against migrants over the years in Saxony, especially since the influx of more than a million refugees to Germany in 2015 and 2016. While the share of foreigners in Saxony remains below the national average, concern among the population about migrants committing crimes is particularly high. Chemnitz prosecutors said a 22-year-old Iraqi and a 23-year-old Syrian were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with Sunday's killing. Adding to pressure on Kretschmer, who faces state elections next year, opposition parties have called for an investigation into alleged collusion between police and far-right extremists after the arrest warrants for the two suspects were leaked on social media. The incident comes days after a man at a far-right protest was filmed harassing journalists. Police subsequently held the reporters for 45 minutes - ostensibly to check their identities - preventing them from covering the demonstration. It later emerged that the protester was a civilian employee of Saxony's criminal police department. On Thursday, the state police department said that after talks with the man and his lawyer, the man would resign from his job with the police next week, the German news agency dpa reported. Green party lawmaker Claudia Roth told news agency dpa that \"organized far-right extremists\" appeared to be using public anger over the killing for their ends. Footage showing numerous protesters performing the stiff-armed Nazi salute was evidence of their extremist ideology, she said. Public displays of the salute, the Nazi swastika and other means of glorifying Adolf Hitler's National Socialist regime are forbidden in Germany and can result in fines or prison sentences. Authorities in Saxony requested the help of federal police to prevent further outbursts of violence in the coming days, including during a planned far-right protest outside a town hall meeting Kretschmer planned to hold with citizens late Thursday. In a separate incident, police said Thursday that a 20-year-old Syrian man was attacked in the northern city of Wismar by three German-speaking men shouting anti-migrant slurs and had to be hospitalized for his injuries. Rostock police said the incident late Wednesday was being investigated as a hate crime. The Syrian in Wismar was on his way home alone when he was attacked. Two of the suspects punched him in the face and the third hit him with a chain on the shoulder and ribs area, knocking him to the ground before they fled. He was released after treatment for a fractured nose and bruises to his face and upper body. The co-leader of Alternative for Germany, which came third in last year's national elections, said he understood the public anger over the killing of the German man last Sunday. Alexander Gauland told daily Die Welt in an interview published Wednesday that \"when such a killing occurs, it's normal for people to snap.\"",

In a race that has grown increasingly testy in recent weeks, longtime Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett, 60, and Gateway Mortgage Company founder Kevin Stitt, 45, have touted their conservative credentials as they seek to replace term-limited GOP Gov. Mary Fallin. Cornett has come under fire from Stitt, who attacked the former mayor in one ad as not being supportive enough of Trump or his immigration policies. In a televised debate last week, Cornett shot back, criticizing Stitt as a Johnny-come-lately to Oklahoma's Republican political scene. \"Where have you been over the last 14 years?\" Cornett said during the debate on Oklahoma City's KOCO-TV. \"You haven't been on the front lines fighting for conservative principles.\" Stitt, though, has fully embraced his standing as a businessman and political outsider. \"I've been in the private sector, in the real world creating jobs,\" Stitt responded. \"I haven't been cashing a government check.\" Republican candidates who try to align themselves more closely with Trump have seen success in a number of other states, including neighboring Kansas, said GOP political consultant Trebor Worthen. \"The Republican Party is President Trump's party, and any politician that you see across the country who has not been adequately supportive of President Trump has paid a price for that,\" Worthen said. \"The line of attack that the Stitt campaign is leveling against Mayor Cornett for not supporting President Trump in 2016 is a very effective line of attack.\" The two men's performance in the 10-candidate field in July broke along geographical lines, with Cornett winning big in Oklahoma City and central Oklahoma, and Stitt taking counties in Tulsa and eastern Oklahoma. Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb, who finished a close third in the race and performed well in many rural counties, hasn't endorsed either candidate. Those geographical differences separate the two candidates more than political ideology, said Republican political consultant Pat McFerron, who worked on Lamb's campaign. \"There might be a slight ideological difference, but it's very minor,\" McFerron said of Cornett and Stitt. \"I think we're going to see a much larger difference on geography.\" Both men have touted their opposition to abortion and support of Trump, but differed on their support of a tax increase this year narrowly approved by the Legislature to help pay for the first teacher pay hike in a decade. Cornett has said he supported Fallin's signing of the bill, while Stitt has said he wouldn't have signed it. Stitt has been able to outpace Cornett in fundraising mainly by bolstering his campaign with personal loans totaling more than $3.2 million so far, bringing his total raised to more than $6.5 million. Cornett has raised more than $3.2 million, but his campaign has been aided by two outside groups that have spent nearly $1 million on pro-Cornett ads. The winner of Tuesday's GOP primary will advance to November's general election against former Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson, who easily secured his party's nomination in June. Republicans running for statewide office in Oklahoma have enjoyed dominating success at the ballot box in the last decade, but Democrats are pinning their hopes on Edmondson, a 71-year-old Vietnam veteran and four-term attorney general. Edmondson hopes to tap into voter frustration with the GOP Legislature exacerbated by this spring's statewide teacher walkout and an anti-Trump sentiment that has energized Democratic voters. Edmondson met frequently with some of the tens of thousands of teachers who thronged the Capitol during the two-week walkout and talks on the stump about his experience as a young high school teacher in his hometown of Muskogee. Libertarian voters also get to cast their ballot in Tuesday's primary runoff between Chris Powell of Bethany and Rex Lawhorn of Broken Arrow.",

            "article_content": "CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia government lawmakers on Friday elected Treasurer Scott Morrison as the next prime minister in a ballot that continues an era of extraordinary political instability. Morrison defeated key challenger Peter Dutton, a former Cabinet minister, by a vote 45-40. Dutton's supporters had forced incumbent Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to hold the leadership ballot. Turnbull did not contest the ballot and later confirmed his intention to quit politics. His resignation would cause a by-election that could cost the government its single-seat majority. It could also encourage Morrison to soon call general elections. Scott Morrison previously worked for Tourism Australia before he was elected to parliament in 2007. He was an immigration minister in the government of Tony Abbott, and become known for a harsh \"stop the boats\" policy, which was intended to prevent asylum-seekers from traveling to Australia by sea. Called Operation Sovereign Borders, this policy saw asylum-seekers who did arrive in Australia either sent back to their countries of origin or transferred to camps on remote islands. Conditions in those camps, where some asylum-seekers have been held for years, have been criticized by human rights groups. Dutton's failure prevents the Australian policy shifting to the hard right, although there has been little policy discussion in the leadership crisis. Turnbull condemned Dutton supporters for bringing down his leadership in an intense and bruising campaign, which the prime minister described as \"an insurgency,\" that went public Tuesday. \"Many Australians will be shaking their head in disbelief at what's been done,\" Turnbull said. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop had been among the favorites and could have become Australia's second female prime minister. She was rejected on the first round of voting. A beleaguered Turnbull demanded the names of lawmakers in the conservative Liberal Party who wanted him to go before he would allow them to choose a new prime minister at a meeting at Parliament House on Friday. The names would prove a majority of his government had abandoned him. The bare minimum majority of 43 signatures were provided shortly before the meeting started. They included more than one Turnbull supporter who signed to break the impasse. Turnbull has become the fourth prime minister to be dumped by his or her own party before serving a full three-year term since the revolving door to the prime minister's office started in 2010. The trend is universally hated among Australians, who expect they will get to judge their leaders at the ballot box. Dutton's and Turnbull's camps waged the most chaotic, frenetic and at times farcical leadership struggle that Australian politics has seen in years, closing down Parliament on Thursday and damaging the Liberal Party's credibility. Public anger became apparent overnight with windows broken at the Brisbane office of Dutton, Turnbull's main rival in his government. But the extend of disquiet about Turnbull's leadership proved to be exaggerated by many Dutton supporter. Of the 85 lawmakers at Friday's meeting, 40 opted for no change.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic side of Congress is almost certainly going to look a little different after the midterm elections this year, as a result of the success of women and minority candidates in primary contests. Race by race, they've begun to make inroads into the traditional white and male establishment of national politics. The victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic primary against New York Rep. Joe Crowley -- a ten-term incumbent and the fourth highest-ranking Democrat in the House -- has been a beacon for other outsider progressive women and minorities trying to defeat entrenched Washington incumbents. Ocasio-Cortez is a self-avowed democratic socialist who supports Medicare for All and abolishing U.S. Immigration and Enforcement, which have become a litmus test for progressive Democrats. She is also a 28 year old Latina who upended the powerful Queens Democratic machine with her defeat of Crowley. Ocasio-Cortez's stunning victory inspires comparisons now whenever any progressive underdog candidate wins. Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida, shares many planks of Ocasio-Cortez's platform, and could be the first black governor of the state.\u00a0 Ayanna Pressley, who won a Democratic primary against 10-term Rep. Michael Capuano Tuesday night, could become the first black representative that Massachusetts sends to Congress.\u00a0 Kerri Evelyn Harris, a mixed race veteran and organizer, will find out Thursday night whether she'll be successful in unseating incumbent Democratic Sen. Tom Carper in Delaware's primary.\u00a0 Although Pressley and Harris have each been called \"the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\" by some media reports because of their shared progressive values and underdog outsider status, the comparisons have their limits. In Delaware, Harris, like Ocasio-Cortez, is a first-time candidate. She has a military background, is a community activist, and is also an openly LGBT woman of color. Harris is getting some help on the ground from Justice Democrats, the same group that recruited and supported Ocasio-Cortez's primary bid. Carper, meanwhile, has far out-raised Harris, but her supporters are hoping that the enthusiasm around her campaign is enough to propel her to victory. As was the case for Crowley, Harris' opponent, Carper, has support from big-name establishment Democrats, namely former Vice President Joe Biden, an icon in his home state of Delaware. Biden has recorded robocalls on Carper's behalf. However, while Carper spends a lot of time at home and campaigns regularly in his state, Crowley had a reputation for spending more time in Washington than in his Queens district.\u00a0 Delaware selected controversial candidates in primaries in the past -- conservative firebrand and\u00a0\"not-a-witch\" Christine O'Donnell won the Republican primary in the 2010 Senate race, instead of the hand-picked establishment candidate.\u00a0 Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, a first-time candidate whose previous experience was in political organizing, Pressley has been an elected official for years. Pressley previously worked for Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy II and Sen. John Kerry, and so Congress is familiar to her. She was the first woman of color elected to the Boston City Council in 2009. Pressley v. Capuano also differed from Ocasio-Cortez v. Crowley in that Pressley was not running significantly to the left of Capuano, a progressive who has been a reliable liberal vote since 1999.\u00a0 She readily acknowledged that there was little daylight between their policy positions, but argued that her candidacy was more about representation than policy.\u00a0 Massachusetts' 7th Congressional District is the only district in the state with more nonwhite than white residents. Capuano represented the old school of Boston politics, while Pressley ran on changing the face\u00a0 of the Massachusetts congressional delegation. Pressley took a page from Ocasio-Cortez and shunned money from corporate political action committees, raising significantly less than her opponent. During her campaign, she worked to engage more diverse voters, including black voters in neighborhoods such as Roxbury, Dorchester and Jamaica Plain, according to The New York Times.\u00a0 Caitlin Conant contributed to this article.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden recorded a campaign ad in support of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Tuesday, two weeks before the state primary election, as Cuomo faces a challenge from actress Cynthia Nixon. \"I've known Andrew for over 20 years. I know he's got skills, guts and experience,\" Biden says in the video. The ad features several pictures and clips of Biden and Cuomo together, shaking hands or hugging. Cuomo is seeking his third term. Nixon is running against Cuomo from the left, claiming that the incumbent governor is not progressive enough. Cuomo has overseen the legalization of same-sex marriage and has enacted some of the most stringent gun control laws in the country. However, he has hedged on issues that Nixon proudly supports, such as legalizing recreational marijuana and abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Nixon has no previous experience in government, although she has been an education activist in New York City for years. She was a staunch supporter of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio during his election campaign in 2013 and his re-election in 2017. Cuomo and de Blasio are political rivals. The ad featuring Biden highlights Cuomo's several years of governing experience, implicitly reminding voters that Nixon is a political neophyte. Although Nixon's name is never mentioned, Biden discusses how important it is for New York to have a seasoned leader as it takes on the administration of President Trump. \"We have leaders in Washington who want to roll back decades of progress no matter what the cost. This is one of the most challenging times I've ever seen for our country,\" Biden says in the ad. \"Andrew Cuomo is the perfect antidote.\" Cuomo has recently faced criticism from Mr. Trump for saying during a bill signing earlier this month that America was\u00a0\"never that great.\" Cuomo and Nixon will have a televised debate on Wednesday, Aug. 29. The primary is Sept. 13. Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has worked to portray himself as a major antagonist to President Trump, offered an alternative to the president's famous campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again,\" at a bill signing Wednesday. \"We are not going to make America great again. It was never that great,\" he said. The audience members, who were there to watch Cuomo sign a bill to make sex trafficking a felony in the state, reacted with audible gasps and cheers. The governor was attempting to make a larger point about women's equality, but the context was lost with the shocked reaction to his first sentence. \"We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged. We will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women -- 51 percent our our population -- is gone, and every woman's reach full potential is realized and unleashed,\" Cuomo said. The governor, a Democrat, is currently seeking re-election for his third term. Cuomo's Republican challenger, Marc Molinaro, almost immediately released a statement condemning Cuomo's words. \"America, with its imperfections, has always been great,\" Molinaro said. \"Mr. Cuomo owes the nation an apology. He should be ashamed of himself.\" And Cuomo's Republican opponent @marcmolinaro is out with a statement on this pic.twitter.com/1iWUa6WJte Cuomo is also facing a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, an education activist and former \"Sex And The City\" star. Nixon has staked a position far to the left of Cuomo, supporting such policies as Medicare for All, abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and legalizing recreational marijuana. Cuomo has shifted to the left in his rhetoric and policies in recent months, including softened language about\u00a0legalizing recreational marijuana. Cuomo, who is considered a potential 2020 presidential candidate, is a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, and the state has sued the administration several times.

            "article_content": "ATLANTA -- With a damning secret recording of his opponent and a Trump-Pence endorsement late in the race, Secretary of State Brian Kemp won a bruising Republican runoff Tuesday in the race for Georgia governor. Kemp in November will face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who could become the first black woman governor.  A self-described \"unapologetic conservative\" whose campaign ran an eyebrow-raising ad that said he could use his own pickup truck to \"round up criminal illegals,\" Kemp rode a national wave of voter contempt for the establishment in favor of bare-knuckled outsider politics.  The race will test Democrats' assertion that changing demographics have turned the Republican stronghold into a swing state.  Kemp beat once heavily-favored Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who outraised Kemp more than 2 to 1 and had a Rolodex of endorsements from establishment Republicans in the state including Gov. Nathan Deal. The NRA had thrown their support behind Cagle, CBS \u00a0Atlanta affiliate WGCL-TV reports.  In a tweeted endorsement last week, President Trump pointed to Kemp's tough stance on illegal immigration and strong support for gun rights. With days left in the race, Vice President Mike Pence also stumped for Kemp on the campaign trail. Both reiterated their support for Kemp in tweets Tuesday.  Kemp thanked supporters at a party in his hometown of Athens, Georgia, Tuesday night.  He said he had won a \"clear, convincing victory\" over Cagle and credited the White House's backing for sealing his win. He said Trump \"poured gasoline in the fire\" that fueled his victory.  Kemp also pivoted to attacking Abrams.  He portrayed the race against her in November as a battle with the \"radical left\" as Georgia's future hangs in the balance.\u00a0 Cagle asked his supporters to stand behind Secretary of State Brian Kemp's bid for governor.  After conceding the GOP runoff to Kemp, Cagle told supporters Kemp was \"undeniably ready to lead this state.\"\u00a0 Cagle began to lose ground after the release of a secret recording in June in which he says he helped pass a \"bad public-policy\" bill for political gain. The recording was made without Cagle's knowledge during a private conversation with former GOP gubernatorial rival Clay Tippins, who last week endorsed Kemp. Portions of the recording were released by Tippins and then by Kemp's campaign.  In a 50-second piece of the recording released in early July by Kemp's campaign, Cagle candidly discusses the GOP primary's sharp turn to the right, saying the five-man race came down to \"who had the biggest gun, who had the biggest truck and who could be the craziest.\"  Cagle denied that his words amounted to criticism of Republican primary voters, saying they were aimed squarely at his opponent.  Kemp had received widespread criticism - and national headlines - with television ads in which he pretends to intimidate a young man interested in his daughter with a shotgun and says he has a big pickup truck \"just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take 'em home myself.\"  Kemp's opponents also hammered his record of securing voter data as secretary of state, in a line of attack likely to become a refrain for Abrams during the general election.  Cagle labeled Kemp \"inKempetent,\" pointing to a 2015 incident in which Kemp's office inadvertently released Social Security numbers and other identifying information of millions of Georgia voters on disks sent to members of the media and political parties.  Kemp said a member of his staff was responsible for the error, that person was fired, and procedures were changed.  Kemp's office made headlines again last year after security experts disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn't fixed until six months after it was first reported to election authorities. Personal data was again exposed for Georgia's 6.7 million voters, as were passwords used by county officials to access files.  Kemp spokeswoman Candice Broce laid the blame squarely on Kennesaw State University, which had a contract to manage the system. \"It was not our system. It was not our equipment. It was not our network,\" Broce said.  In the race ahead, Democrats point to a Georgia electorate that has become more urban and less white in recent decades as a sign they may be able to break the GOP winning streak for statewide office. Abrams already has star power, having garnered national attention when she won more than 76 percent of Democratic votes in her May 22 primary. ",

            "article_content": "German soccer star Mesut \u00d6zil has represented his country in three World Cups, even leading Germany to its first World Cup victory in more than two decades in 2014 as their leading scorer with an impressive eight goals. Yet the star attacking midfielder -- who became the most expensive German player of all time when he was acquired by Arsenal in 2013 for \u00a342.5 million -- just quit Germany's national team in a series of explosive tweets, alleging racism on the part of the German media and the head of the German football association, over a photo he took with Turkish President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in London in May. \"Like many people, my ancestry traces back to more than one country,\" \u00d6zil, who was born and raised in Germany, wrote a statement on Twitter. \"Whilst I grew up in Germany, my family background has its roots firmly based in Turkey.\" \u00d6zil's grandfather moved from Turkey to Germany in the 1970s, seeking work as part of the formal guest worker, or Gastarbeiter, program, popular in parts of Europe at the time. The family settled in Gelsenkirchen, where the soccer star was born in 1988. So, while \u00d6zil spent his entire childhood in Germany's industrial Ruhr region, like many children of immigrant families, he feels a strong emotional pull toward the country of his ethnic roots as well.\u00a0 \"During my childhood, my mother taught me to always be respectful and to never forget where I came from,\" \u00d6zil said on Twitter Sunday. \"I have two hearts, one German and one Turkish.\" The past couple of weeks have given me time to reflect, and time to think over the events of the last few months. Consequently, I want to share my thoughts and feelings about what has happened. pic.twitter.com/WpWrlHxx74 Because of his family's ties to Turkey, when \u00d6zil encountered Turkish President Erdo\u011fan at a London charity event in May, out of respect, the soccer star says he didn't hesitate to take pictures shaking hands with the controversial leader, whose crackdown on opponents has been widely denounced by human rights groups and democratic governments like Germany's.\u00a0 At the time of the photo, Reinhard Grindel, the president of DFB, the German football association, criticized \u00d6zil for posing with Erdo\u011fan, stating \"football and the DFB stand for values that Mr. Erdo\u011fan does not respect. That's why it's not acceptable that our national team players are exploited for his election campaign.\" \u00d6zil, however, argued that the photo op was entirely apolitical. \"I'm aware that the picture of us caused a huge response in the German media,\" \u00d6zil wrote on Twitter Sunday, \"[but] the picture we took had no political intentions... For me, having a picture with President Erdo\u011fan wasn't about politics or elections, it was about me respecting the highest office of my family's country... Whether it had been the Turkish or the German president, my actions would've been no different.\" \u00d6zil goes on to say that the two spoke only about soccer, since President Erdo\u011fan also played the sport in his youth. However, right-wing German media is portraying the interaction as something entirely different -- the reason for Germany's poor performance in the 2018 World Cup. \"If a newspaper or pundit finds fault in a game I play in, then I can accept this \u2013 I'm not a perfect footballer and this often motivates me to work and train harder,\" \u00d6zil writes. \"But what I can't accept are German media outlets repeatedly blaming my dual-heritage and a simple picture for a bad World Cup on behalf of an entire squad. Certain German newspapers are using my background and photo with President Erdo\u011fan as right-wing propaganda to further their political cause... They didn't criticise my performances, they didn't criticise the team's performances, they just criticized my Turkish ancestry... This crosses a personal line that should never be crossed, as newspapers try to turn the nation of Germany against me.\" \u00d6zil goes on to state that while Adidas, Beats and BigShoe have stuck by him during this difficult time, other partners and sponsors have dropped him -- even removing his likeness from World Cup ads -- over fear of the right-wing German media. He also alleges that German politicians and prominent citizens have made racist remarks about his Turkish heritage amidst the backlash over the photo. \"I don't want to even discuss the hate mail, threatening phone calls and comments on social media that my family and I have received,\" \u00d6zil continues. \"They all represent a Germany of the past, a Germany not open to new cultures, and a German that I am not proud of... It is with a heavy heart and after much consideration that because of recent events, I will no longer be playing for Germany at international level whilst I have this feeling of racism and disrespect. I used to wear the German shirt with such pride and excitement, but now I don't.\" The DFB, for its part, has now issued a statement denying \u00d6zil's claims of racism and putting the onus for Germany's roster change squarely on the shoulders of its former star: \"We regret that Mesut Ozil had the feeling that he wasn't protected enough against racist slogans \u2013 like Jerome Boateng once was. But it was important that Mesut Ozil gave answers to the topic, like Ilkay Gundogan did, regardless of the result at the World Cup in Russia. At the DFB, we win and lose together, everyone as a team. The DFB would have been happy if Mesut Ozil remained a part of the team. He decided to not do so.\" Meanwhile, social media reaction has been swift, with several of the world's most prominent soccer stars turning to Twitter to tweet their support for \u00d6zil's decision. Surreal that someone who has done so much for his country on and off the pitch has been treated with such disrespect. Well done @MesutOzil1088 for standing up to this behaviour! https://t.co/w1dvWOHFYN Massive Respect \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffd @MesutOzil1088 https://t.co/2QbHQ958VF Had Germany gone on to win the World Cup this year, as they did in 2014, none of this might have transpired. Mesut Ozil had, after all, been named German Player of the Year on five occasions, and he might have been heralded for his play yet again. As it turned out, however, Germany was shockingly and embarrassingly shut out, scoreless, in the group round by Mexico and then South Korea, setting the stage for a sort of scapegoatism which reflects a larger world grappling with issues of immigration and national identity. \"In the eyes of Grindel and his supporters, I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose,\" \u00d6zil said on Sunday.\u00a0 And this isn't the first controversy to come out of the 2018 World Cup with respect to players' ethnicity vs. their nationality. Last week, South African-born \"Daily Show\" comedian Trevor Noah took heat for proclaiming that the World Cup, which France won on July 15, was actually won by Africa because of the large percentage of players on the French roster of African descent. \"Yes. Yes. Africa won the World Cup! Africa won the World Cup!\" Noah joked on his July 17 episode. \"I get it. I get it. They have to say it's the French team, but look at those guys -- you don't get that tan by hanging out in the south of France,\" Noah said. France's ambassador to the U.S. then fired back in a letter that \"the rich and various backgrounds of these players is a reflection of France's diversity,\" and said Noah's joke was akin to an \"argument of the white supremacist.\" \"I love those players,\" Noah shot back. \"I don't take their Frenchness away, but I also don't think you need to take their Africanness away.\" It's a global debate that shows no signs of abating anytime soon. And until it does, issues of national identity are likely to continue bleeding over onto the sports field, where the penalties may be far graver than a simple yellow card or a free kick.

            "article_content": "HELENA, Mont. \u2014 U.S. Sen. Jon Tester gave President Trump a tongue-in-cheek welcome to Montana Thursday by taking out a full-page ad in more than a dozen newspapers thanking him for signing 16 bills the Democrat sponsored or co-sponsored. Mr. Trump was scheduled to hold a rally in Great Falls on Thursday to campaign for Tester's Republican challenger, State Auditor Matt Rosendale. The president has made the Montana Senate race a priority after he blamed Tester for derailing the nomination of his first Veterans Affairs nominee, White House physician Ronny Jackson. Tester's ad, which ran in the Great Falls Tribune and in newspapers across rural northern and eastern Montana, sought to undermine the president's efforts to boost Rosendale by pointing out that he and the president agree on several issues. \"Welcome to Montana, and thank you President Trump for supporting Jon's legislation to help veterans and first responders, hold the VA accountable, and get rid of waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government,\" the ad read. The Tester campaign also planned a statewide radio ad campaign to run through the weekend touting his bills that Mr. Trump has signed. Tester is one of 10 Senate Democrats running for re-election in states that Mr. Trump won in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump singled out Tester in April, saying the farmer from Big Sandy \"will have a big price to pay\" for releasing allegations against VA nominee Jackson that included drunkenness, overprescribing medication and fostering a hostile work environment. Jackson denied the claims, but withdrew his nomination. Montana is the latest stop on Mr. Trump's midterm campaign tour, designed to boost Republicans as well as advocate for his first 18 months in office. He recently made a similar trip to North Dakota and is expected to keep traveling throughout the summer. In Great Falls, Mr. Trump plans to promote his record on the economy and national security, said a person familiar with the president's plans, adding that Mr. Trump would stress his recent moves on immigration and foreign policy as well as the low unemployment rate. The person was not authorized to discuss the plans publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The president is also expected to paint Tester as an \"obstructionist\" and embrace Rosendale as a better fit for the state that he won by 20 points. The visit comes less than two weeks after his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., campaigned for Rosendale in Billings. Rosendale, who is seeking to deny Tester a third term and give Montana an all-Republican congressional delegation, said Mr. Trump has focused on the race because of Tester's \"liberal obstruction.\" Montana, a purple state that elects both Republicans and Democrats to statewide offices, strongly supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 election, leading both candidates to compete for Trump supporters. Rosendale said he'll back Mr. Trump's agenda, while Tester said he'll support the president when it's in the state's interests and oppose him when it's not. Tester planned to spend Thursday listening to farmers' and business owners' concerns about Mr. Trump's import tariffs and was expected to be driving back to his farm when the president spoke, spokeswoman Marnee Banks said.",

            "article_content": "Ben Rhodes, who served as President Obama's campaign speechwriter and later his deputy national security advisor, said Monday the Trump administration's reversal of so many Obama administration policies is based not on ideology but simply because they were put into place by President Obama.\u00a0 Rhodes (who is the brother of CBS News president David Rhodes) joined \"CBS This Morning\" to discuss policymaking in the Obama administration, and his new book, \"The World as It Is: A Memoir of the Obama White House.\" Co-host Gayle King asked Rhodes whether Mr. Obama or other members his administration feel that the current president is now trying to \"unravel and undo everything that the Obama administration did.\"\u00a0 \"There are certain policies that they've targeted \u2013 Paris climate agreement, Cuba, TPP,\" said Rhodes, referring to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. \"There's not an ideological rationale for why you would take down all of those policies, other than that Barack Obama did them.\" \"I say in the book we didn't get everything right. I say that there are things I'm not certain about, and I'll be saying it for the rest of my life. I'll be thinking about the decision-making on Syria the rest of my life,\" Rhodes said, reflecting on the shortcomings of the U.S. response as Syria's civil war spiraled out of control. \"[But] the fact that America is a progressive, inclusive country that has a future that is more inclusive and more diverse, that I truly do believe. And frankly I think the project of the Obama presidency that will endure for decades, that's the direction America is headed \u2013 and that's not the direction Donald Trump is headed.\u00a0 \"So, I think when history has its accounting, America is going to end up looking a lot more like the Obama presidency than the Trump presidency.\" When asked about a comment by Mr. Obama following the 2016 election in which he said, \"What if we were wrong?,\" Rhodes said, \"President Obama wasn't unlike a lot of Americans after the election. He was trying to figure it out. There were different theories: Was it Russian meddling? Was it the campaign that the Democrats ran? We were on that last foreign trip and I was sitting with him in his presidential limousine and he'd read a column saying that maybe Democrats had pushed too far in the embrace of globalization and had gotten away from that sense of identity that is important to people, part of which was what President Trump had stoked.\u00a0 \"But I think, frankly, the reality is, any number of causal factors led to President Trump, and what I answer in the book is that question, which is, I don't think we were wrong.\" Co-host Norah O'Donnell asked if Mr. Trump won on a message of change.  \"That was his message,\" Rhodes said. \"The racism and misogyny was also a part of the message, and that's important to know.\" Rhodes said he felt \"shell-shocked\" by Clinton's loss, and admitted not considering the likelihood of a Trump win. But when asked whether the question \"What if we were wrong?\" was an indictment of the American electorate for not being willing to further the advances of Mr. Obama's presidency, Rhodes replied, \"Absolutely not. What President Obama has said his entire political career is, his bet was always on the American people. He couldn't become the first African-American president, a two-term president, without the confidence of the American people.\u00a0 \"I think what he's getting at is a bigger phenomenon in the world. We were on a trip that led up to that comment that he made, when we saw Angela Merkel in Germany who'd taken huge flack for letting in Syrian refugees. She literally had a tear in her eye the last time she saw President Obama. We left Justin Trudeau sitting there alone wondering what was going to happen with President Trump, and now we see.  \"We've seen the President Xi Jinping of China, who made kind of an ominous comment to us that if an immature leader throws the world into chaos, the world doesn't know who to blame. He was not talking about President Obama!\u00a0 \"And I think what he's referring to there is a sense of globalization, of immigration, trade. We're part of an enterprise, basically, a liberal international order that had pushed very far at changing the nature of our world over the last several decades, and the question is, did that get too far ahead of voters in places like the United States and United Kingdom who were feeling a sense of uncertainty because of that change?\" With regard to Mr. Trump's moving forward with plans for a summit with North Korea later this month, co-host John Dickerson asked, \"I know you're not a fan of President Trump, but doesn't he deserve his due in getting this to where it's gotten so far?\"\u00a0 \"Look, I think diplomacy is preferable to military conflict. The question is, what does that diplomacy produce? What I think is most likely is you'll see the North Koreans make commitments to denuclearize in the future, but in the past we've seen them make those commitments and not follow through. The follow-through is a question for them.\" David Morgan is a senior editor at CBSNews.com and cbssundaymorning.com.",

            "article_content": "President Trump on Thursday pardoned a conservative commentator he claims \"was treated very unfairly by our government!\" and announced he's thinking about clemency for Martha Stewart and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, among \"lots\" of other people. \"What they did to him was horrible,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking of his decision to clear the name of Dinesh D'Souza, who had pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud. It was the latest example of Mr. Trump trying to right a perceived wrong with his presidential pardon power, and a move that makes ever clearer that, in the Trump administration, the odds of a pardon have heavily favored those with a celebrity backer, those who have become a cause celebre among conservatives and those with a reality TV connection. Mr. Trump has been particularly drawn to cases where he believes there was a political motivation to the prosecutions \u2014 a situation that may remind him of his own predicament at the center of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling, which he insists is nothing but a \"witch hunt.\" Longtime associate of Mr. Trump, Roger Stone, told the Washington Post the president's recent pardons are a \"signal\" to former campaign aides who have been charged with crimes.\u00a0 \"It has to be a signal to Mike Flynn and Paul Manafort and even Robert S. Mueller III: Indict people for crimes that don't pertain to Russian collusion and this is what could happen,\" Stone told the Post. \"The special counsel has awesome powers, as you know, but the president has even more awesome powers.\" On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was seriously considering commuting the sentence of Blagojevich, the Democratic former governor serving a 14-year prison sentence on numerous counts of corruption, including trying to sell the U.S. Senate seat that was vacated by Barack Obama. The president also said he was considering a pardon for Stewart, the celebrity lifestyle guru who served a stint in federal prison after being convicted of charges related to a stock sale. Both had connections to Mr. Trump's \"Celebrity Apprentice\" reality television show: Blagojevich was a contestant in 2010 and Stewart hosted the 2005 spinoff series, \"The Apprentice: Martha Stewart.\" The president said as much on Thursday. \"Rod Blagojevich -- 18 years in jail for being stupid and saying things that every other politician, you know that many other politicians say,\" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"And if you look at what he said he said something to the effect like what do I get ... stupid thing to say. But he's sort of saying ... he's gonna make a U.S. senator, which is a very big deal. And it was foolish ...18 years now. I don't know him other than that he was on 'The Apprentice' for a short period of time.\" Stewart, the president said, was once his \"biggest fan in the world.\"\u00a0 \"I think to a certain extent Martha Stewart was harshly and unfairly treated,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And she used to be my biggest fan in the world.\" Hours earlier, Mr. Trump said on Twitter he would pardon D'Souza. An outspoken critic of Obama, D'Souza claimed his prosecution by the Obama Justice Department was politically motivated. Mr. Trump has issued five pardons as president: The first went to former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, a top Trump supporter during the 2016 campaign, who was spared the prospect of serving jail time after a conviction stemming from his use of racially targeted immigration patrols. Next came Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, who had taken photos of classified portions of a submarine. Mr. Trump often mentioned Saucier's case on the campaign trail as he criticized his former Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, for her use of a private email server. Saucier had claimed his prosecution was driven by sensitivity about classified information driven by Clinton's case. Next came former White House aide I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby. A former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, Libby was convicted of lying to investigators and obstruction of justice following the 2003 leak of the covert identity of a CIA officer. The Libby case was taken up by conservatives who argued he was the victim of an overly zealous and politically motivated prosecution by a special counsel. That pardon, especially, was seen as a sign that Mr. Trump might be willing to pardon former aides caught up in the Mueller inquiry. Mr. Trump has also been moved by cases championed by celebrities. Last week, he pardoned Jack Johnson, boxing's first black heavyweight champion, whose case had been brought to his attention by actor Sylvester Stallone. And on Wednesday, he met with reality TV star Kim Kardashian, who urged him to pardon Alice Marie Johnson, a woman serving a life sentence for drug offenses. Mr. Trump's predecessors largely relied on a formal, Department of Justice process to identify those deserving of clemency. None of the clemencies that Mr. Trump has granted have come through the front door of the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney, which typically assists the president in exercising his pardon power. Instead they've been brought to the president by White House lawyers, advisers and outside confidants and celebrities, according to a senior White House official, who said there are dozens of pardons currently under consideration by White House attorneys and the president. The official said Mr. Trump has prioritized actions that have personally affected him \u2014 noting he's been particularly drawn to cases where he believes there was political motivation to the prosecutions. In its latter years, the Obama administration searched for candidates like nonviolent drug offenders and those affected by mandatory minimum sentencing policies, viewing clemency as a tool to promote policy goals. There is no such systematic review by the Trump White House. But White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was unfair to suggest the only people winning pardons under Trump are those connected to him or with a celebrity backer. \"Certainly, something has to be brought to his attention and if somebody has the ability to do that it would help, but the president is making decisions based on the merits of the individual cases and what he thinks is the right thing to do,\" she said. \"There's a process, but ultimately the president has the power and the authority to make a decision and he does.\" Since the beginning of his presidency through May 7, Mr. Trump received 570 requests for pardons and about 2,306 requests for commutation of sentences. But because there were pending requests at the end of the Obama administration, the total number of requests for pardons pending before Trump is 2,271 and 8,932 for commutation. Mr. Trump has denied dozens of pardon and commutation requests, while thousands of petitions have been closed without presidential action. Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which worked with the Justice Department during the Obama administration to help identify candidates for clemency, said that many are torn over Mr. Trump's decision-making process, which appears to be more haphazard than in the past. \"Nobody wants to criticize displays of mercy because we think they're so sorely lacking, but most of these wouldn't be on anyone's 'Top 10' list of people who have been mistreated by the system,\" Ring said. Others were more critical. \"The president's ad hoc use of the pardon power is concerning enough. But the possibility that he may also be sending a message to witnesses in a criminal investigation into his campaign is extremely dangerous,\" tweeted Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that no one asked him to pardon D'Souza. But D'Souza told the conservative Daily Caller that Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas played a key role. D'Souza said that during a dinner about a month ago, Cruz said he would push for a pardon in conversations with Trump. D'Souza said Cruz called him recently to tell him Mr. Trump was receptive to the idea and action could be imminent. D'Souza, whose case had become a cause in conservative circles, was sentenced to five years' probation in 2014 after pleading guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to a U.S. Senate campaign in the names of others. Watchdog groups criticized D'Souza's pardon, saying it signaled contempt for the rule of law. \"Donald Trump has sent a message to his friends and cronies that if you break laws to protect him or attack our democracy, he's got your back,\" said David Donnelly, president and CEO of Every Voice. Mr. Trump is not the only president to draw flak for his pardon decisions. Former President Bill Clinton ignited a major controversy with a last-minute pardon for fugitive financier Marc Rich, the ex-husband of a major Democratic fundraiser. And Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon for his involvement in the Watergate scandal just days after taking over from his predecessor. ___ Associated Press writer Jonathan Lemire aboard Air Force One, Zeke Miller and Kevin Vineys in Washington, and Michael Tarm in Chicago contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "After ten were killed in an attack on a high school south of Houston on Friday, Washington mourned another mass shooting in America. \"This has been going on too long in our country,\" President Trump said at the White House, \"too many years, too many decades now.\" The assault was the nation's deadliest such attack since the massacre in Parkland, Florida that sparked a movement for stricter gun control laws. Also this week, President Trump ramped up his attacks on \"the Obama FBI,\" suggesting federal authorities may have planted a spy into his 2016 presidential campaign. The president's alarm came as the special counsel's Russia probe rounded the corner on its first year, decried by the president as \"the greatest Witch Hunt in American History.\"  However, Mueller's team is not the only investigation probing Russian election meddling. The Senate Judiciary Committee released thousands of pages Wednesday from its inquiry into a June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer. And the Senate intelligence committee announced it had finalized its review, concluding that Russian President Vladimir Putin intervened in 2016 to help then-candidate Trump.  On Capitol Hill, Republican leaders were dealt a blow Friday as opposition from Democrats and the conservative House Freedom Caucus scuttled a bill to renew popular farm subsidies and tighten work requirements for food stamp recipients. The Freedom Caucus is demanding a vote on a conservative proposal to curb legal immigration and support President Trump's promised border wall with Mexico.  In a controversial move Friday, the Trump administration proposed reviving a Reagan-era policy that abortion rights supporters have pilloried as a \"gag rule\" on federally funded family planning clinics. The move comes as Democratic enthusiasm grows for this year's congressional midterm elections, when the party hopes to flip crucial seats. And next week, South Korean President Moon Jae-in will fly to Washington to consult with President Trump over his planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Despite a spat over comments by key White House security aide John Bolton, the Trump administration is forging ahead with the meeting some hope will make history denuclearizing the peninsula.

            "article_content": "The sprawling network funded by the billionaire Koch brothers is having a very good run with President Donald Trump in the White House and Republican control of Congress. Tax cuts are now signed into law. A conservative judge is seated on the Supreme Court. And many governmental regulations, including those on labor and environmental practices, are facing rollbacks. That success is starting to get attention. Democrats are increasingly questioning how far the network's influence extends into the White House, casting the groups' backing by industrialists Charles and David Koch as puppeteers behind Mr. Trump's agenda and hoping to rouse their own donors to fight back. The network in turn is ratcheting up its focus on areas where it aligns with Democrats\u2014 most notably immigration legislation \u2014 and reviving calls for bipartisanship. \"We've come off one of the most successful years in our network's history,\" said James Davis, executive vice president of Koch-backed Freedom Partners and a spokesman for the Seminar Network, the broader organization of groups and donors. \"And we're going to turn up the heat on both parties to drive forward.\" But there's another outcome, too: Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and other senators recently fired off letters to the administration asking for a detailed accounting of the network's role at various government offices including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Labor Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The senators name more than a dozen individuals working in the administration with ties to the groups. On Monday, the lawmakers will launch a series of Senate floor speeches turning a spotlight on the influence. \"Americans have a right to know if special interests are unduly influencing public policy decisions that have profound implications for public health, the environment, and the economy,\" wrote Whitehouse with Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.; Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev.; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.; and Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M. The influence of the Koch-backed groups is somewhat surprising. They are an array of organizations and include Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners and Concerned Veterans for America, whose donors include some of the wealthy attendees of the twice-a-year Seminar Network conferences. The groups took a pass on donating to Mr. Trump's presidential bid. But they have managed to influence policy through several top allies in key jobs sprinkled across the administration. Among those in the Koch orbit with ties to the administration, perhaps the most prominent is Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, who is a past president of Freedom Partners, the network's chamber of commerce-styled group. Short plays a key policy-making role and is a Capitol Hill fixture of legislative battles. The senators mention several others with top policy roles, including Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president. Koch groups have been central to Trump policies Democrats oppose \u2014 among them tax cuts for the wealthy, loosening of environmental regulations, and expanding private-sector health care for veterans. Mr. Trump's first-year regulatory rollbacks were drafted by one of the Koch-backed groups and became a ready blueprint for action in Congress. The network, however, doesn't just toe the Trump line. On Monday, the group is stepping up its effort to push Congress not to let up on legislating as lawmakers turn to focus instead on campaigning for midterm elections. Two groups in the network are releasing a letter to congressional leaders of both parties, urging them to take up a bipartisan compromise to help young immigrants, known as Dreamers, who have been living in the U.S. illegally since childhood. They want Congress to pass a deal that was on the table earlier this year \u2014 a path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers and $25 billion for border security. Because most Americans want a solution that would allow the Dreamers to avoid deportation, the group says Mr. Trump and Congress should be able to come up with a solution. \"There is no reason to continue to delay action on the Dreamers,\" wrote officials from Freedom Partners and the LIBRE Institute, two network groups. \"What are we waiting for?\" The group is also pushing Congress to take up criminal justice reform, another issue with bipartisan support that has lagged. Republicans have little appetite to engage on big-ticket items as they struggle to keep control of their majority in the House, and try to pick off Democratic incumbents up for re-election in the Senate from conservative Trump-won states. And Democrats, while saying they are willing to engage with the Koch-backed groups, are at times envious of their operation and eager to pound on their influence, which includes chapters that mimic traditional party apparatus in many battleground states. It doesn't help build bipartisanship when much of the advocacy the Koch groups undertake, unleashing their army of volunteers and spending sums on advertising, ends up going against Democratic senators in Missouri, Wisconsin, North Dakota and others in tough election battles.",

            "article_content": "Florida\u00a0Gov. Rick Scott is challenging Democratic Senator Bill Nelson in an election that could be one of the most expensive and closely-watched races in the nation. Scott formally announced his Senate bid on Monday in Orlando after months of speculation that the governor would run.\u00a0 \"I am going to run for the\u00a0 U.S. Senate representing the great state of Florida so this is going to be a lot of fun,\" Scott told supporters in a video on his Facebook page, \"Scott for Florida.\" \"We're going to do the exact same thing we've done in Florida, we're going to turn around the national economy we're going to make sure that Washington works for us. It can work, it must work, we're going to make sure it works for Florida and for all of us,\" he added.\u00a0 He made the announcement 8 years after he launched his race for governor, saying he \"did something that everyone told me not to do.\"\u00a0 \"With the hard work of Floridians, we have come a long way, but our work is not done,\" added Scott.\u00a0 In scripted remarks made available ahead of his announcement in Orlando, Scott called Washington \"horribly dysfunctional.\" \"Washington is full of old thinking. Washington is tired. And the truth is, both political parties share some of the blame. They've tried a lot of things -- it just didn't work. But I will not accept the idea that we can't change Washington.\" Among his Senate policy issues, Scott told supporters in Orlando that he will push for term limits on Congress.\u00a0 \"This concept of career politicians has got to stop,\" said Scott. He added, \"We're not going to see a change in Washington if we don't have term limits.\" Scott is a multi-millionaire businessman who never ran for office before his successful governor's race in 2010. He campaigned as part of the tea party movement and called for massive budget and tax cuts, but was forced to scale back his plans amid opposition from the GOP-controlled Legislature. He also changed his hard-line positions on immigration. Scott is leaving office due to term limits, and had been urged to challenge Nelson, Florida's only statewide-elected Democrat, by President Donald Trump. Democrats have been anticipating his move for months and have ramped up their criticism, noting that Scott had previously been forced out as chief executive of Columbia/HCA amid a federal fraud investigation. Although Scott was never charged with any wrongdoing, the health care conglomerate paid a then-record $1.7 billion fine for Medicare fraud. Democrats also plan to fault Scott over his record while governor, including his initial push for deep budget cuts to education and his back-and-forth position on whether to expand Medicaid. \"Floridians will have the benefit of a clear-eyed view of a truly dismal record,\" said Dan Gelber, a former state senator and now Miami Beach mayor. \"Floridians won't forget the damage Rick Scott's self-serving politics have done these last 7 years, no matter how he tries to change his spots and obscure his record.\" Scott's record on gun laws earned him an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association before the killings of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in February. Ultimately, Scott signed Florida's new law raising the age limit to purchase rifles to 21 and creating a new process enabling law enforcement to seize guns from someone who is considered a danger. Scott took aim at Nelson meanwhile, contending the Democrat has \"done nothing\" in the Senate on high-profile issues such as gun violence. Nelson said Scott has not done enough -- he wants universal background checks and a ban on certain types of semi-automatic rifles.",

            "article_content": "Congressional leaders have finalized a sweeping $1.3 trillion budget bill that substantially boosts military and domestic spending but leaves behind young immigrant \"Dreamers,\" deprives President Donald Trump some of his border wall money and takes only incremental steps to address gun violence. CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan reports that the first big hurdle for the House was passing a procedural measure that allowed them to vote on the actual text of the omnibus bill. \u00a0Republican members cheered as it passed in a 211-207 vote which was closed after there was a narrow majority in support.\u00a0 With this vote, a final passage vote on the full omnibus package is slated for Thursday afternoon. Kaplan adds that many Democrats who voted no on the procedural measure will ultimately support the bill. As negotiators stumbled toward an end-of-the-week deadline to fund the government or face a federal shutdown, House Speaker Paul Ryan dashed to the White House amid concerns Mr. Trump's support was wavering. Although some conservative Republicans balked at the size of the spending increases and the rush to pass the bill, the White House said the president backed the legislation. Mr. Trump himself sounded less than enthused, tweeting late Wednesday: \"Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.\" Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming. Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next year...most ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment. Talks had stretched into Wednesday evening before the 2,232-page text was finally released. \"No bill of this size is perfect,\" Ryan said. \"But this legislation addresses important priorities and makes us stronger at home and abroad.\" Negotiators have been working for days \u2014 and nights \u2014 on details of the bill, which is widely viewed as the last major piece of legislation likely to move through Congress in this election year. Lawmakers in both parties sought to attach their top priorities. Two of the biggest remaining issues had been border wall funds and a legislative response to gun violence after the clamor for action following recent school shootings, including the one in Parkland, Florida. On guns, leaders agreed to tuck in bipartisan provisions to bolster school safety funds and improve compliance with the criminal background check system for firearm purchases. The bill states that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can do research on gun violence, though not advocacy, an idea Democrats pushed. But there was no resolution for Dreamers, the young immigrants who have been living in the United States illegally since childhood but whose deportation protections are being challenged in court after Mr. Trump tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. After the omnibus was posted, the conservative House Freedom Caucus announced they would oppose the bill for a variety of reasons, including what they feel is insufficient funding for border security, a failure to block federal dollars to sanctuary cities, and allowing the Fix NICS bill to be included without also including concealed carry reciprocity. There are roughly 30 members of that group, many of whom often vote against these large spending bills anyway. With enough Democratic support, their no votes won't matter. Democrats temporarily shut down the government earlier this year as they fought for that protection. But the issue only rose to a discussion item when Mr. Trump made a late-hour push for a deal in exchange for $25 billion in border wall funds. Instead, Mr. Trump is now poised to win $1.6 billion for barriers along the border, but none of it for the new prototypes he recently visited in California. Less than half the nearly 95 miles of border construction, including levees along the Rio Grande in Texas, would be for new barriers, with the rest for repair of existing segments. In one win for immigrant advocates, negotiators rejected Mr. Trump's plans to hire hundreds of new Border Patrol and immigration enforcement agents. \"We are disappointed that we did not reach agreement on Dreamer protections that were worthy of these patriotic young people,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The emerging plan removes a much-debated earmark protecting money for a rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The item was a top priority of Mr. Trump's most powerful Democratic rival, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, but Mr. Trump vowed to veto the bill over the earmark. Under the legislation, the project would remain eligible for funding, however, and a Schumer aide said it was likely to win well more than half of the $900 million sought for the project this year. The core purpose of the bill is to increase spending for military and domestic programs that have been sharply squeezed under a 2011 agreement that was supposed to cap spending. It gives Mr. Trump a huge budget increase for the military, while Democrats scored wins on infrastructure and other domestic programs that they failed to get under President Barack Obama. Leaving the chamber tonight, Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, summed up how many lawmakers see the next two days: \"The members know what is at stake. We have to pay our troops and support our president.\" That largesse has drawn opposition from some fiscal conservatives and could make passage a potentially tricky process. Last month, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul triggered a brief government shutdown over his objections to the deficit spending. On Wednesday, he tweeted his opposition to the emerging legislation, known as an \"omnibus.\" \"It's a good thing we have Republican control of Congress or the Democrats might bust the budget caps, fund planned parenthood and Obamacare, and sneak gun control without due process into an Omni ... wait, what?\" Paul tweeted. Most essential was support from Mr. Trump, who has been known to threaten to veto legislation even when his team is involved in the negotiations. Word of Mr. Trump's discontent sent Ryan to the White House, where he was invited to a face-to-face with the president, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the phone. White House aides said the president's support was never in doubt, but one senior White House official said the president was concerned that details of the package weren't being presented as well as they could be, both to members of Congress and the public. The group discussed how they could better sell the package, said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the private conversation. \"The president and the leaders discussed their support for the bill,\" said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, adding that it would fund Mr. Trump priorities such as wall construction, add money to combat the opioid crisis and provide new infrastructure spending. Both parties touted $4.6 billion in total funding to fight the nation's opioid addiction epidemic, a $3 billion increase. More than $2 billion would go to strengthen school safety through grants for training, security measures and treatment for the mentally ill. Medical research at the National Institutes of Health, a longstanding bipartisan priority, would receive a record $3 billion increase to $37 billion. Funding was also included for election security ahead of the 2018 midterms. Child care and development block grants would receive a huge $2.4 billion increase to $5.2 billion. And an Obama-era transportation grant program known as TIGER would see its budget tripled to $1.5 billion. Head Start for preschoolers would get a $610 million boost, while an additional $2.4 billion would go for child care grants.",

Warren also did not explicitly pledge to complete a second six-year Senate term if she's re-elected in November. \"I am not running for president of the United States. I am running for the United States Senate. 2018. Massachusetts -- woohoo,\" the senator said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday. She repeated her assertion on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" saying \"I am not running for president in 2020.\" The high-profile liberal is often discussed as a potential 2020 rival to President Trump. But she denied those claims during several Sunday show interviews. \"We really have to be in this fight for our democracy as we go forward and it's been incredible privilege to serve the people of Massachusetts, to go down to Washington and to say, I'm not here to serve the rich and the powerful, I'm not here to fight for an America that works better for a thinner slice of the top, I'm here to fight for working families like the kind of family I grew up in,\" Warren told \"Fox News Sunday\" of her 2018 re-election campaign in Massachusetts.\u00a0 She told \"Meet the Press\" that she knows there's anxiety among Democrats about a possible second Trump term. \"We can't just be a party that says we're paying attention about what happens every four years, and I know there's a lot of anxiety particularly on the Democratic side, about how are we going to deal with Donald Trump in 2020,\" Warren said. She added that her focus now remains on \"the fights taking place every single day\" on the Senate floor on issues like immigration health care and gun reforms.\u00a0 A Massachusetts newspaper had challenged Warren to clear up questions about her claims to Native American heritage by taking a DNA test. Asked if she will, Warren instead talked about her family and Native American issues. \"I went to speak to Native American tribal leaders and I made a promise to them that every time President Trump wants to try to throw out some kind of racial slur, he wants to attack me, I'm going to use it as a chance to lift up their stories,\" she said on CNN. Mr. Trump derisively refers to Warren as \"Pocahontas\" to mock her claim about being part Native American, most recently taking on her ancestry during a Saturday night rally in Pennsylvania. She said on Sunday that her Native American heritage is \"a part of who I am and no one will take that from me.\"",

            "article_content": "After last year's successful drive to cut taxes, what does the majority party in Congress do for an encore? The answer for Republicans seems to be, \"Not so much.\" For sure, Republicans in Washington feel good about the effect their overhaul of the nation's tax code is having on the economy, and recent polling suggests it's getting more popular as the midterm elections draw closer. But looking ahead to other potential legislation to boast about in hopes of boosting GOP chances of retaining control of the House and Senate, the agenda is pretty thin. President Donald Trump's trillion-dollar-plus plan to boost infrastructure has landed with a thud. Hopes in the House of taking on welfare reform seem likely to fizzle in the Senate. And issues like immigration and now even gun control invite internal GOP divisions at the height of primary season. Repealing and replacing former President Barack Obama's health care law is off the table. Instead, the GOP-controlled Congress is looking ahead to a year of abbreviated workweeks and low-profile and small-bore initiatives. The House is spending more and more time on the obscure and the arcane; the Senate chamber is being turned over for weeks at a time to routine nominations. Instead of repealing \"Obamacare,\" lawmakers are promising bipartisan legislation to free smaller banks from stricter regulations passed in 2010, fund the fight against opioids, and implement the party's promise for a huge military buildup. To many Republicans, that's plenty. \"We're going to have the largest defense buildup since Ronald Reagan. Most Republicans, they'd consider that a pretty big accomplishment. We're going to clearly do more on opioids than we've ever done,\" said veteran Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. \"They may be secondary issues to most people, but if you can pick off three or four big things like that I think you've got something to run on.\" Opioid funding and the Pentagon increases are on track to pass this month as part of a $1.3 trillion catchall spending bill, a follow-on measure to a long-sought bipartisan budget outline that passed in February. That omnibus bill is one of the few legislative trains that's guaranteed to leave the station this year. But for now, the Capitol Hill agenda is remarkably light. The Senate spent last week on a series of confirmation votes, continuing a pattern since Trump took office of devoting one out of every three weeks, on average, solely to voting on Trump nominees. And at other times, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., steers clear of controversial legislation and avoids Democratic filibusters. Every bill that passed the Senate last year either advanced under filibuster-proof rules or with the support of Democrats. In other words, there wasn't a single filibuster last year, simply because McConnell kept the floor free of anything that Democrats could block. The result was that the Senate floor became, for weeks at a stretch, a legislative dead zone. For its part, the House had a two-day workweek on noncontroversial legislation last week after GOP leaders canceled votes for Wednesday and Thursday, citing the decision to have Rev. Billy Graham lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. But some Democrats weren't buying it, noting that the supposed precedent cited by GOP leaders to cancel votes wasn't an ironclad tradition. They suggested the real reason was that the House had nothing to do and that lawmakers wanted to stay out of town to avoid political pressure on guns. Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., said they should have spent last week working on legislation to reduce gun violence. Instead, the House passed legislation aimed at cracking down on sex trafficking on the internet, which is part of a low-profile but widely backed Capitol Hill effort to combat human trafficking. This week, though, it's back to the obscure BRICK Act, an Obama-era chestnut that would delay new Environmental Protection Agency rules for brick makers. There's also legislation to ease clean air rules for power plants that burn low-quality coal refuse. Bigger issues like a hoped-for renewal of farm programs are a possibility, but a fight over House GOP demands to cut food stamps could kill it in its crib. In the Senate, Republicans are looking ahead to a scaled-back assault on the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Rather than an outright repeal, Republicans appear set to embrace a Senate effort that's focused more on providing regulatory relief to smaller banks. A number of Senate Democrats have signed on, especially those from rural states won by Trump. That's the type of smaller victory that may not have mass appeal but that is important to key constituencies back home. \"It's incumbent upon members to go home and sell what we're doing up here,\" said Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga. \"If we're always playing to the big event or playing to get on the news, then I think you're running a race that puts you behind the curve. They need to be in their districts, they need to have their focus on communicating with their districts.\"",

They leave behind frustrations, concerns and hopes for their respective deliberative bodies, things they hope will change even after they leave.\u00a0 \"Face the Nation\" sat down with some of the most influential Republican lawmakers leaving Congress. They spoke of a need for more diversity, less partisanship and loyalty to principle over the president.\u00a0 \"When you look at the future of the Republican Party, I think that we would be foolish to not see that we're heading into trouble,\" said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a retiring Republican who represents a diverse Florida district. \"Very few women are running on the Republican Party ticket for office. Far greater numbers of women are identifying themselves as being in the Democratic Party. Minorities that have always been, traditionally, a group that we should really be going after -- I don't see that we really have a recruiting program that's active to get minorities involved in our party.\" Ros-Lehtinen said the GOP seems unable to adapt to an increasingly diverse electorate. \"When you look ahead, what's our future going to be? Are we going to end up a marginalized party?\" she asked. \"I think that we need to look toward the future, and we need to have the policies that attract millennials, women and minorities. I don't see that.\" Arizona's Sen. Jeff Flake, who has issued scathing criticisms of Mr. Trump, shared similar fears about the party's failure to be racially inclusive.\u00a0 \"If you look, every four years, every presidential election cycle, we are as a country 2 percent less white,\" Flake said. \"You know, voters of color. It's changing that way. And I don't think that we've made enough of an effort as Republicans to appeal across a broader electorate.\" Flake said President Trump and GOP positions on key issues have also caused young people to turn away from the party. \"Given some of the positions, and the behavior that the president has exhibited, I think it makes it very difficult for young people to identify with the Republican Party,\" he said. \"I think they've been walking away from the party in general. I think they're at a dead sprint right now. \u00a0And we've got to change that.\" The outgoing lawmakers also expressed concerns over the future of their deliberative bodies as a whole, questioning whether Congress still has the ability to solve the nation's greatest problems with partisanship enveloping Capitol Hill. Flake pointed to a failure to come together on solutions that have broad support among the public as evidence of this political paralysis. \"In the Senate we have a 60-vote requirement for most legislation,\" Flake said. \"And we've had a hard time coming together. There are things that we should -- on the gun issue, obviously the bump stocks, 'no fly, no buy,' those kind of things -- there's broad consensus in the country, certainly. And there should be, and I hope that we can move legislation like that. There's no reason we shouldn't be able to.\" Ros-Lehtinen placed some of that failure\u00a0at the feet of the president.\u00a0 \"But on immigration, you look at the president's position, and what he says on Monday may be different than what he says on Wednesday, and may be different on Friday,\" she said. \"So it's very hard, I think -- for leaders on DACA, on Dreamers, like Jeff Flake -- to figure out a way forward. It's schizophrenic what's coming out of the White House in terms of policy on immigration and Dreamers.\"",

            "article_content": "A day after the deadliest school shooting in the U.S. in five years, Russian bots began inundating Twitter with gun-related tweets. Shooting-related terms dominated the trending hashtags and trending topics at\u00a0Hamilton 68, which is a website created by the bipartisan security organization Securing Democracy to track activity from Twitter accounts it's identified as linked to Russian influence campaigns. Popular terms included \"guncontrol,\" \"gunreformnow,\" \"floridaschoolshooting\" and \"nikolascruz,\" which refers to the suspect in the shooting. At\u00a0Botcheck.me, a website that tracks 1,500 political propaganda bots, the dashboard for most-popular hashtags in 24 hours from Wednesday to Thursday evening was dominated by terms such as \"guncontrol,\" \"parkland\" and \"gunreformnow.\" Ash Bhat, one of the project's creators, wouldn't speculate on who was behind the bots his site tracks but told Wired the bots amplify the hashtags until they're eventually adopted by human users. \"Over time, the hashtag moves out of the bot network to the general public,\" he said. The figures from the bot-tracking sites illustrate how Russian meddlers continue to manipulate the platform following efforts to use social networks to sow discontent during the 2016 U.S. election. Those efforts targeted highly politicized social issues such as immigration, guns and LGBT rights. Twitter has said it detects about 450,000 \"suspicious\" logins a day that may be bots or computer programs created to automatically post and respond to things on Twitter. It has also said it's identified 3,814 accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, which was the seat of the Russian propaganda effort during the election. Prosecutors on Thursday\u00a0charged Cruz, a 19-year-old former student at the school, with 17 counts of premeditated murder after the rampage Wednesday at\u00a0Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

            "article_content": "WICHITA, Kan. -- Attorneys for three men accused of plotting to bomb a mosque and apartment complex housing Somali refugees urged a federal judge on Wednesday to include prospective jurors from rural western Kansas because they are more likely to have voted for President Donald Trump. But the government countered that granting the request would as a matter of policy \"wreak havoc,\" saying the defense is seeking to pick a jury pool based on ideology while \"opening a dangerous door\" to similar requests in other cases. U.S. District Judge Eric Melgren took the matter under consideration after a hearing in U.S. District Court in Kansas, saying he would try to rule quickly. The trial begins March 19 in Wichita. Gavin Wright, Patrick Stein and Curtis Allen are charged with conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy against civil rights for allegedly planning to detonate truck bombs in the meatpacking town of Garden City the day after the November 2016 election. Wright also faces a charge of lying to the FBI. Stein, using the screen name Orkin Man,\u00a0referred to Somali immigrants as \"cockroaches\"\u00a0and expressed his belief that the government is run by a terrorist organization, Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mattivi said in October. The three men, who were indicted in October 2016, have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors have argued the men formed a splinter group of the militia Kansas Security Force that came to be known as \"the Crusaders.\" Wright is quoted in a wiretap transcript as saying he hoped the attack on the Somalis would \"wake people up\" and inspire others to take similar action against Muslims. The defense contends the case will require jurors to weigh whether the alleged conduct constitutes a crime or whether it is constitutionally protected speech and assembly and the right to bear arms. Defense attorneys had argued that court plans to only summon citizens in the more urban counties closest to the federal courthouse in Wichita is a discriminatory practice that excludes rural and conservative jurors. But the judge during the hearing noted several counties surrounding the federal courthouse in Wichita already used to draw potential jurors are rural counties. Kansas voted overwhelmingly for Trump in the 2016 election, and Melgren mused during the hearing that he does not see a material difference between picking a jury pool from a group that voted two-thirds for Trump as compared to a group that voted three-fourths for Trump. During the campaign Trump called for a crackdown on immigration and a ban on Muslims entering the country. But attorney Kari Schmidt, who represents Wright in the case, told the judge there is a difference in the belief systems between people in rural southwest Kansas where the crimes allegedly occurred and people in the other rural counties near Wichita that the judge cited in making his comparison. \"I don't think I can say it's legally recognizable, but factually recognizable,\" she said. The government cited legal cases finding that groups of prospective jurors defined by geographical location are not \"distinctive\" groups for purposes of a constitutional attack on a prospective jury pool. By contrast, women and racial groups are considered distinctive groups for such purposes. Prosecutors contended the defense request would set a \"dangerous precedent.\" \"At its core, it is seeking to stack the deck,\" Justice Department attorney Risa Berkower said.",

Asked by reporters Wednesday about President Trump's reaction to the book, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, \"I think, furious, disgusted, would probably certainly fit when you make such outrageous claims and completely false claims against the president and his family.\" Here are some of the highlights so far from\u00a0Wolff's \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House:\" Post-election plans didn't include winning: Top campaign advisers Kellyanne Conway and Jared Kushner, also Donald Trump's son-in-law, and Donald Trump himself never \"wavered in their certainty\" that he would lose. \"Not only would Trump not be president, almost everyone in the campaign agreed, he should probably not be,\" Wolff wrote. He reported that Conway was pursuing a permanent on-air job, that Donald Trump was building his brand and floating rumors of a Trump network, and Melania Trump could return to \"inconspicuously lunching.\" \"Losing would work out for everybody,\" Trump believed, according to Wolff. Just after 8 p.m. on Election Night, when it was beginning to look like Mr. Trump might win, Donald Trump Jr. reportedly said his father \"looked as if he had seen a ghost.\" Melania Trump \"was in tears -- and not of joy.\" Trump's \"ignorance\": \"He was what he was. Twinkle in his eye, larceny in his soul. Everybody in his rich-guy social circle knew about his wide-ranging ignorance,\" Wolff wrote. Campaign aide Sam Nunberg reportedly attempted to explain the Constitution to him and got as far as the Fourth Amendment before Mr. Trump became bored. Disgraced Fox News chief Roger Ailes told him he needed a \"son of a b****\" as chief of staff, rather than his first preference, Kushner. Conway told him, \"You can't just hire your children.\" Ailes suggested former House Speaker John Boehner. \"Who's that?\" asked Mr. Trump. After a phone conversation with the president-elect on visas for high-skilled workers, in which Mr. Trump allegedly claimed that Silicon Valley companies could use his help after the unfavorable Obama years, Wolff says media mogul Rupert Murdoch told him, \"Donald, for eight years these guys had Obama in their pocket. They practically ran the administration. They don't need your help.\" Mr. Trump apparently replied that they \"really need these H-1B visas.\" Murdoch, according to Wolff hung up the phone and said, \"What a f****** idiot.\" Bannon's vision: He had a list of some 200 executive orders for the first 100 days, and the first would be an immigration crackdown. He was able to push through his agenda, Wolff wrote, because none of the top staffers had specific responsibilities. Trump residence: The president maintains a separate bedroom from his wife, according to Wolff, and he ordered two more TV screens for his bedroom, in addition to the one that was already there. And he had a lock put on the door. No one, wrote Wolff, touches anything. The president even strips his own bed. When he wasn't having a 6:30 p.m. dinner with Bannon in the early days of the administration, he was in bed by then, with a cheeseburger, TVs on, and he was calling his friends. Ivanka Trump for president: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner made a deal that if the opportunity came up, \"she'd be the one to run for president. \"The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump,\" Wolff wrote. \u00a0Bannon's response: \"'They didn't say that?\" he said. \"Stop. Oh, come on. They didn't actually say that? Please don't tell me that. Oh my God.'\" Trump's hair: Ivanka Trump \"treated her father with a degree of detachment, even irony, going so far as to make fun of his comb-over to others. She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate -- a contained island after scalp-reduction \u00adsurgery -- surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The color, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men -- the longer it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump's orange-blond hair color.\" Bannon's opinion of Ivanka Trump: The Wall Street Journal, which has obtained the book, said that Bannon says she is as \"dumb as a brick.\"   The White House slammed the book and those who cooperated with Wolff. \"This book is filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House. Participating in a book that can only be described as trashy tabloid fiction exposes their sad desperate attempts at relevancy,\" Sanders initially said in a statement. Sanders told reporters Wednesday that there were about \"a dozen\" interactions between Wolff and White House officials, which she said took place at Bannon's request. Mr. Trump also spoke to Wolff, in what Sanders characterized as \"one brief conversation that had nothing to do originally with the book.\" They talked for about 5 - 7 minutes, and Sanders said it was \"the only interaction he's had with Michael Wolff since he took office.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement, \"The book is clearly going to be sold in the bargain fiction section. Mrs. Trump supported her husband's decision to run for President and in fact, encouraged him to do so. She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did.\" Grisham also said that Melania Trump has never met Wolff. A spokesperson for Kushner and Ivanka Trump declined to comment. Bannon figures heavily in Wolff's book, and according to the Guardian, which also got an early look at Wolff's book, Bannon says that Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer -- which included former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- was \"treasonous\" and \"unpatriotic.\" Bannon also allegedly told Wolff that the government investigation into whether Trump campaign associates colluded with the Russians would \"crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.\" In June 2016, Trump Jr., Manafort and Kushner met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York. Rob Goldstone, an associate of Trump Jr., had told Trump Jr. that the Russians had damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. When Trump Jr. claimed that there was in fact nothing worthwhile on Hillary Clinton that came out of the meeting, according to the Guardian, Wolff writes that Bannon ridiculed Trump Jr., Manafort and Kushner. \"The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor \u2013 with no lawyers. They didn't have any lawyers,\" Bannon said. \"Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s***, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.\" Bannon went on to talk about what he thinks they should have done instead, which would have been to have the campaign's lawyers meet with the Russians and let the material be \"dumped\" to Breitbart or \"maybe some other more legitimate publication.\" With that approach, \"You never see it, you never know it, because you don't need to \u2026 But that's the brain trust that they had,\" Bannon added. President Trump issued a blistering statement Wednesday about Bannon: Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party. Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans. Steve doesn't represent my base -- he's only in it for himself. Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed in May to take over the Russia investigation after the president fired FBI Director James Comey, has indicted Manafort and his associate Rick Gates on money laundering charges, and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Mr. Trump has consistently denied colluding with Russia. Wolff told the Guardian that he spoke to Mr. Trump and a number of senior officials and advisers for \"Fire and Fury,\" which will be published next week, and he said that one recurring theme in the book is the \"rancor\" between Bannon and Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter. He quotes former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who has advised Mr. Trump, as well as Kushner, as saying, \"It is a war between the Jews and the non-Jews.\" Kushner and Ivanka Trump are both Jewish. Wolff also says in the book, according to the Guardian, that one of Mr. Trump's outside advisers and a close friend, billionaire Thomas Barrack Jr., said of the president, \"He's not only crazy, he's stupid.\" However, Barrack denied ever having made the comment. \"The quote attributed to me by Michael Wolff is completely and utterly false,\" Barrack said in a statement to CBS News. \"I have never been interviewed by Michael Wolff, nor did I give him any quotes, nor did he attempt to verify this totally false comment with me. It is clear to anyone who knows me those are not my words, and they are wholly inconsistent with how I talk and feel about the President who is my longtime friend and for whom I have inordinate respect.\" Trump attorney Ty Cobb declined comment.

            "article_content": "Outgoing White House chief of staff John Kelly, reflecting on his tenure working with President Trump, blamed former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the controversial \"zero tolerance\" policy that separated immigrant families at the southern border. In an exit interview with the Los Angeles Times, he also admitted the border wall \u2014 a signature promise by Mr. Trump \u2014 isn't really a wall.\u00a0 \"To be honest, it's not a wall,\" Kelly told the paper. \"The president still says 'wall' \u2014 oftentimes frankly he'll say 'barrier' or 'fencing,' now he's tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.\" Kelly will leave the administration on Wednesday and will be replaced by Mick Mulvaney as acting chief of staff. In his interview with the L.A. Times, Kelly reflected on the highs and lows of his tenure, laying the blame for the child separation policy at the feet of Sessions, who was fired after the midterm elections in November. In May, Sessions announced the Justice Department would pursue prosecution of anyone entering the country illegally, meaning adults traveling with children would be separated from their family members. Kelly said the announcement had caught the White House by surprise, even though Kelly himself had previously raised the possibility that separating families could serve as a deterrent for illegal immigration. \"What happened was Jeff Sessions, he was the one that instituted the zero-tolerance process on the border that resulted in both people being detained and the family separation,\" Kelly said. \"He surprised us.\" The administration backtracked in June, with Mr. Trump signing an executive order to keep families together even as the Justice Department pursues prosecutions. Kelly said he was looking forward to taking a break from what he called a \"bone-crushing hard job.\" Kelly served 46 years in the Marines and retired in January 2016 as the U.S. military's longest-serving general. As chief of staff, he said he typically woke up at 4 a.m. and came home at 9 p.m., where he kept working. \"I'm guarded by the Secret Service. I can't even go get a beer,\" he joked.",

            "article_content": "As the partial government shutdown enters its second week, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana called the stalemate in negotiations between the White House and congressional leaders \"nothing short of ridiculous.\" \"We passed a bill ... a couple of weeks ago to keep the government open and the House refused to take it up,\" Tester said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, referring to a funding measure passed by the Senate two weeks ago which went nowhere after President Trump said he would not support it. \"I think the fact that we're at a government shutdown is nothing short of ridiculous.\" Tester, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Democratic and Republican lawmakers need to sit down and \"pound out\" an agreement to reopen the government, which has been partially closed since Dec. 22.\u00a0Hundreds of thousands of federal employees\u00a0will work without pay or be furloughed until the shutdown ends.\u00a0 Tester said one of the main sources of the impasse in Congress, which reconvenes Monday, is the president's unwavering $5 billion demand for funds to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\u00a0 \"The problem is that the president has $1.3 [billion] from last year for border security \u2014 actually $21 billion for border security, $1.3 [billion] for the wall \u2014 that he has spent very little of,\" Tester said. \"And he says yet he needs more.\"\u00a0 He added that although the president wants to appear like he's not backtracking on one of his principal campaign pledges, the border security Mr. Trump is now calling for differs from what he touted on the campaign trail.\u00a0 \"The president wants to continue to take a campaign promise that he made, which was to have Mexico pay for a wall, and say, 'No the rules have changed. Now, we're still going to build a wall but we're going to have the American taxpayer pay for it. We're going to use the American taxpayer like an A.T.M. machine,'\" he said. \"That's not the right direction to go.\" Tester said Mr. Trump shifted positions from his initial $1.6 billion border security request in the budget proposal for fiscal year 2019. \"The president moved the goalposts and said, 'No, now I want $5 billion,'\" he said.\u00a0 After\u00a0meeting with U.S. service members in Iraq\u00a0Wednesday,\u00a0Mr. Trump said he would do \"whatever it takes\"\u00a0to ensure Congress approves funding for a border wall. Earlier in December, in a remarkable Oval Office clash with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, the president vowed to take the blame if the government shut down. But he has recently sought to fault Democrats, dubbing it the \"#SchumerShutdown\" in a tweet on Sunday. As the government will likely remain partially closed as the next Congress is sworn in Thursday, Pelosi and House Democrats will be charged with passing a spending bill with their new majority. Tester called the recent deaths of Jakelin Caal and Felipe Alonzo Gomez, two migrant children from Guatemala who were in Border Patrol custody, \"unacceptable.\" On Saturday,\u00a0the president blamed Democrats\u00a0for the migrant children's deaths. But Tester said the deaths were \"everybody's fault\" and highlighted Congress' failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform in recent years.\u00a0 Tester is one of two incumbent Democratic senators who survived tough challenges in the midterm elections in states the president won by more than 10 percentage points in 2016. He said his party can find more electoral success in rural, red states by listening to all constituents and not taking voters for granted.\u00a0 \"I don't look like your basic Democrat,\" he said. \"My wife and I still farm and we still believe in the citizen-legislature model. We go everywhere in the state. I go everywhere in the state and I listen to Montanans, whether it's in conservative areas or liberal areas, and take those ideas back to Washington D.C. and put them into action.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana that aired Sunday, Dec. 30, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Montana Democratic Senator Jon Tester, another member of the committee in charge of government spending. He's also one of only two moderate Democrats to win re-election in a reliable be- reliably red state. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR JON TESTER: It's great to be here, Margaret. Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague Senator Shelby said negotiations are at an impasse and they need to find out what Democrats want and when. As the Democrat here what can you explain? SEN. TESTER: Well first of all, Margaret, I would just say that you know we passed a bill a couple of year- couple of weeks ago to keep- keep the government open. And the House refused to take it up. I think that the fact we're at a government shutdown is nothing short of ridiculous. I think that Senator Shelby and- and others are- are spot on. We need to sit down and- and pound out a deal. I think that that agreement that the- the Senate passed- in a bipartisan way, a couple weeks ago would have give us the opportunity to come to an agreement. The problem is-is- is that the president has one point three billion dollars from last year for- for border security, actually 21 billion for border security, one point three for the wall that he has spent very, very little of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: He says needs more. SEN. TESTER: Yeah. And he says yet he needs more. Yet there's no plan to go where the money how the money is going to be spent or any analysis on what's most effective to secure the border. Bottom line is, Margaret, is that I don't talk to anybody in the Senate that doesn't want secure borders. It's just how the money is going to be spent. And if the president wants to continue to take a campaign promise that he made, which was to have Mexico pay for a wall and say no the rules have changed now we're still going to build a wall but we're going to have the American taxpayer pay for it we're going to use the American taxpayer like an A.T.M. machine. That's not the right direction to go. MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House says it's Democrats who walked away from the table. You heard Senator Shelby say there there was an offer that he put forward of two and a half billion this year two and a half billion next year. What happened to that? SEN. TESTER: Well I think that- that that deal never got passed leadership. But- but what did happen this last year is the president asked for one point six billion dollars in his budget proposal for this next year. The Appropriations Committee, which Senator Shelby chairs, and Senator Leahy is a ranking member of agreed to that in a bipartisan way. Senator Shelby voted for it. Senator McConnell voted for it. The president moved the goalposts and said, no, now I want five billion. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well and they've come down to around two. Why can't Democrats come up from one point three? SEN. TESTER: Well I think that that's negotiations that need to be done between leadership between Senator Shelby, Senator Leahy and others and move forth. But the big thing is is that how is the money going to be spent. What's the most effective way to secure that southern border. And that's really what's important here. I think we can do it with technology and manpower and much more effectively than- than with a wall. MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Senator Shelby say there that he thinks probably you're going to have to talk about things that Democrats have said they wanted including protections for dreamers. Is that the kind of sweetener that would get Democrats to reconsider? SEN. TESTER: Well I think we've been here before. I was- I was in the room when the president said if- if Congress passes that I'm going to sign it. And then he moved back away from that. And so I think ultimately in the end we do need comprehensive immigration reform, there's no doubt about that, Margaret. But- but in the end we need to know what the president wants. And hopefully he'll stick to it. When we passed the bipartisan funding to go to the first of February, a couple weeks ago, the president said he was gonna sign it. And then after we passed it he said he wasn't going to sign it. We need some predictability. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said, of those two migrant children who've died in U.S. custody, that it's Democrats fault. Essentially he's arguing that there's incentives that are in U.S. law that encourage people to cross and take this really dangerous migration route. How do you respond to that? SEN. TESTER: Well I respond to the fact that we need comprehensive immigration reform that needs to be there for a while. I think it's everybody's fault. This is unacceptable. And- and the bottom line is is that if we're able to get comprehensive immigration reform done, which is going to require some-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a big ask. SEN. LEADERSHIP--leadership in the White House too. Then I think that we will see things settle down in the southern border in a big, big way. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a cost for Democrats to appear to work with the president? SEN. TESTER: No, I think what Democrats need to do is they need to work for the country and make sure that not only the southern border, but the northern border is secure make sure that we have the ability on the borders to be able to screen every vehicle coming across to make sure that drugs don't come into this country. And I think that if we're able to get a plan to be able to do that, which I don't think is that hard to do, I think Democrats and Republicans can work together to- to make sure that we have a secure border and- and keep this country safe. MARGARET BRENNAN: When we introduced to you I pointed out that you were one of only two Democratic senators to get reelected in a state that the president took by double digits back in 2016 and the president came to Montana and personally campaigned against you. SEN. TESTER: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: How do- how do you take your win and advise other Democrats on how to win states in the West and Midwest? MARGARET BRENNAN: I don't look like your basic Democrat, Margaret. And- we still farm. My wife and I still farm and we still believe in the citizen-legislature model. We go everywhere in the state. I go everywhere in the state and I listen to Montanans whether it's in conservative areas or liberal areas and take those ideas back to Washington D.C. and put them into action. I think it's more of a function of- of listening and going everywhere. I don't believe in models that say you just knock on this door, you just go to this community and you'll get elected. I think you go everywhere and you listen to everybody. Everybody's got ideas. Some of them are great and take those great ideas back to Washington D.C. and that's how we win. MARGARET BRENNAN: In saying that though are you implying that Democrats have gotten out of touch with the part of the country you're from? SEN. TESTER: I think all politicians have gotten out of touch. In fact, that they just go to certain places where they think they can get enough votes to win. I think that what makes this country great is a Washington D.C. that works for everybody and works for this country. And in order to do that you've got to go everywhere and listen to everybody's concerns and needs and go back and try to find solutions. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you're one of a few working farmers still in the Senate, so I want to ask you about the impact of the trade war. SEN. TESTER: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House put together the second bailout package for-- SEN. TESTER: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: American farmers because of some of the impact of- of the trade war. What has been the impact you've seen in your state and are people questioning their support for the president because of that? SEN. TESTER: Well margins in production agriculture are always really narrow. And so when you get a situation where you start to lose export markets, which is what has happened with this- with this trade war, you end up lowering prices at the farm gate. You have more play- more farms that potentially go into a situation where they're not solvent anymore and bankruptcy. The trade war has to end. We need those foreign markets. I personally have about 40 percent of my crop still on the farm from 2017 because of the trade war. Most folks can't stand that, in fact after about 18 months they'll start going broke. We need those markets. We need to hold China accountable, but we need the markets and we need to move forward. There are other ways to put pressure on China other than using the family farmer, the American farmer as a tool. For instance use the financial system. It'll bring them to- bring them to- to the table much more quickly I believe and it won't put folks in rural America out of business and I think that if this continues we'll see more farmers go broke and we'll see rural America further- further be- be further diminished. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Tester thank you for coming on the show-- SEN. TESTER: Margaret, thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and good to have you here in person.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota that aired Sunday, Dec. 16, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar a key Democratic voice on the Judiciary Committee. Senator, good to have you here. SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thank you so much. It's great to be on, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We had this significant decision out of Texas on Friday with this federal judge striking down Obamacare as unconstitutional and you have tweeted, \"now it's on us and the Democratic attorney generals. Let's get to work.\" What does that mean? SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Well what that means is because you have an administration - and you just heard it - that basically is standing while the house is burning down and instead of going in there and putting out the fire they're throwing lighter fluid on it in terms of tweets and rhetoric and things they're saying. The ruling was absurd. Justice Roberts and a conservative court has already ruled that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional unlike what Mr. Miller said. And in fact you can have part of it not exist and you can still have the rest of it protect Americans. And that is exactly where this is headed and I can say that this is about first of all throwing people off of their insurance. No protection with preexisting conditions, kids staying on their parent's insurance until they're 26 years old. A very popular and important protection. Medicaid expanded for millions of Americans. That's what we're talking about here. And for them just to throw up their hands and say, \"well I'd be great if we just started from scratch.\" That's not what the American people believe. Just look at the results from the last election. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Barrasso who was just here said that he does think there's room for legislation to protect preexisting conditions. One of the things that would get thrown out with this ruling if it's upheld. Would you-- SEN. KLOBUCHAR: But I just mentioned a number of other things that would also have to be done. So the best thing here-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But is there room for Democrats to work on those sort of issue specific things with Republicans? SEN. KLOBUCHAR: There's always room to work on things but the best way - and what I believe will happen - is this will be stayed in court. So it continues to take effect. Then it will go up on appeal. It will be upheld. But what we should be doing is governing from opportunity and not chaos. That means doing something about pharmaceutical prices and passing my bill to allow Medicare to negotiate for less expensive drugs for our seniors and letting less expensive safe drugs come in from other countries so that we can actually have competition doing something about premiums with reinsurance and some of the things going on in the states. So yes there are things to do but we should be working to improve the Affordable Care Act not just throw it out and set it on fire. MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard some disagreement among Republicans on how to do that. There's also disagreement within the Democratic Party on how to handle healthcare. Former Attorney General Eric Holder says it's time now to move to some version of Medicare for all and end this nonsense. That was his reaction to Friday's ruling. Do you agree with him? SEN. KLOBUCHAR: We need universal healthcare and there are many ways to get there. That is one of them. The other is to at least expand Medicare to age 55. There's a number of bills that I'm part of including allowing the expansion of Medicaid which I think is something we're not talking enough about that Senator Schatz from Hawaii is leading. And then of course allowing for an expansion of Medicare. So there's many things we can do. But right now with an administration in place that seems bound and determined to take away people's health care we have to protect the ability of people to even have their health care exist because they are talking about throwing them off for preexisting conditions. MARGARET BRENNAN: As we mentioned you sit on the Judiciary Committee. I want to ask you about some testimony before your committee this week from Customs and Border Patrol. We mentioned the - the case here of this seven year old from Guatemala - this migrant girl who died tragically after passing into U.S. territory. Should the commissioner of CBP, said to you during that testimony that this had happened? It wasn't disclosed until days later. SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Yeah, I just went back and looked at that testimony. I look at the face of that sweet little girl - 7-year-old Jakelin Caal. She looks like the faces of the kids that were in my daughter's second grade class. And he came and testified before us and I asked him if he regretted any of the Trump immigration policies and he said he did, but he didn't even mention that this had happened. Under law they're supposed to tell Congress within 24 hours if someone dies. So we clearly have to get to the bottom of that. But the second thing is comprehensive immigration reform, so that we can have some order at the border and that we can have a smart plan that works for our country, including a path to citizenship and doing something about states like mine where we don't have enough workers in our fields and in our factories. Making sure that we have smart policies that work with fencing and other things. And that's not what they're talking about what they're talking about is chaos. MARGARET BRENNAN: What- are you laying responsibility on the U.S. government for this little girl's death? SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I just want to get it investigated and figure out exactly what happened. But what I do believe is that if we just keep playing games with people's lives - that's what they're doing - they're playing games with people's lives. They're playing games with a shut down which last time cost twenty billion - the Ted Cruz shut down - for our economy. They are playing games with members of Congress, they take the leaders of Congress into the White House and create a media circus instead of just sitting down and negotiating. Do I think that we can avoid a shutdown? Of course, I do. Because there's people on both sides of the aisle that want to find common ground. I think that's possible. But the way that they're acting is not furthering the attempt to make sure that our government is steady at a time when the stock market is careening and we've got a judge throwing out the healthcare bill. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to quickly ask you about a sexual harassment bill that you have been a- a key voice on. But to answer the criticism from the White House, don't Democrats need to show some flexibility to avoid the shutdown? SEN. KLOBUCHAR: We have suggested so many things, comprehensive immigration reform that passed the Senate would have brought down the debt by one hundred fifty eight billion and there was significant funding in there for border security. We just did it with the dreamer's deal that was bipartisan that was suggested. So of course we're willing to work with them. But as pointed out by Speaker Pelosi, there aren't the votes for that wall. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does your sexual harassment bill become law? Do you have any idea? SEN. KLOBUCHAR: We're very excited president is going to sign into law. This is a bill that finally says to America we got rules in place that don't protect politicians, that protect victims and it's time to clean up this mess. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Margaret.",

            "article_content": "Hundreds of immigrants have been dropped off by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a bus station in downtown El Paso and hundreds more may be released in the southwest Texas city in coming days, reports the CBS affiliate there, KDBC-TV. El Paso's outgoing and incoming representatives in Congress and local charity officials said ICE didn't give the city and charities time to prepare to handle the migrants. ICE fired back, blaming Congress for the sudden releases. ICE bussed 214 migrants to the depot Sunday night and some 200 more throughout the day Monday, which left El Paso's Office of Emergency Management and charities scrambling two days in a row, KDBC said. Greyhound told CBS News ICE sent the first group \"without warning\" and did something similar on Oct. 26. Volunteers came to the bus station to donate and hand out food and other items as arrangements were made to bring the migrants elsewhere. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat, said in an interview posted on Twitter, \"We're trying to ensure that ICE gives the community notice next time when they know that there's not going to be space in existing migrant shelters, to give the community 24-hours head-up\" so it can prepare.  \"We expect another 200 on Christmas Day and it's very possible we'll see another 200 released the day after Christmas, pushing the existing available shelter capacity beyond its limits,\" he said. Our thanks to everyone in the community who has come out on Christmas Eve to help migrant families. If you're not in El Paso and want to help, make a donation at https://t.co/062olx7YIp pic.twitter.com/Lm6oEigME2 O'Rourke also said, \"ICE admitted that they made a mistake\" in failing to notify local and charity officials of its plans so they could \"have those beds ready so we don't have migrants standing at a park, or in a parking lot or at a bus station\" without food. \"We just need a little bit of a heads up so that folks aren't \u2026 literally dumped at a bus station without money or on the street,\" O'Rourke said. \"We're a little perplexed because this is not something typically that ICE does,\" said Dylan Corbett, director of Hope Border Institute. Corbett said the federal agency usually communicates with Annunciation House, a nonprofit shelter, so it's prepared for large intakes. O'Rourke's replacement, Rep.-elect Veronica Escobar, also a Democrat, released a statement saying in part, \"The lack of community coordination by ICE \u2026 demonstrates a reckless disregard for very vulnerable people, including children. It is unacceptable.\" ICE countered by pointing at lawmakers, saying in a statement, \"After decades of inaction by Congress, the government remains severely constrained in its ability to detain and promptly remove families with no legal basis to remain in the U.S. To mitigate the risk of holding family units past the timeframe allotted to the government, ICE has curtailed reviews of post-release plans from families apprehended along the southwest border. \"ICE continues to work with local and state officials and NGO partners in the area so they are prepared to provide assistance with transportation or other services.\" O'Rourke didn't run for re-election, instead challenging Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for his seat. O'Rourke lost but impressed observers by only falling about three points short in a heavily Republican state and with his fundraising prowess and ability to draw and excite crowds.",

            "article_content": "Friday evening, President Trump turned to Twitter to name Office of Management and Budget chief Mick Mulvaney his pick for acting White House chief of staff.  ....I look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! John will be staying until the end of the year. He is a GREAT PATRIOT and I want to personally thank him for his service! Fierce speculation had abounded over the president's replacement for John Kelly, after several top contenders made their disinterest for the role clear. Mulvaney will now face steep challenges in the new post, highlighted this week by another torrent of harrowing headlines for the president. \u00a0 Earlier Friday, the special counsel rebuked Michael Flynn's suggestion that FBI agents duped the former intelligence agency head into lying.  \"He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents, to know the importance of telling them the truth,\" Mueller probe attorneys chided in a court filing.  In his own Twitter attacks, President Trump has echoed the argument from his former national security adviser, bashing federal investigators for trying \"to scare everybody into making up stories.\" But the president's wrath has apparently done little to slow prosecutors in his own Justice Department, which this week secured a guilty plea from Russian spy Maria Butina, scored a three year sentence for longtime Trump fixer Michael Cohen, and reportedly opened a potential new front of Trump scrutiny: foreign donations to his inaugural fund.  In the Senate on Thursday, several Republicans broke with the Trump administration to pass bipartisan resolutions condemning Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and calling for an end of U.S. support for the Kingdom's bloody war in Yemen.  And in the House, prospects for President Trump's demands for billions in border wall funding have dimmed in the wake of his fiery encounter Tuesday with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \"I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down,\" the president had told the duo. The president's border funding fight was made thornier Friday by news a child had perished in the Border Patrol's custody, triggering immediate criticism from Democrats and calls for an investigation.  Speaking with the press Friday, White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley mourned Jackeline Caal, appearing to blame her father and current immigration laws for the 7-year-old Guatemalan girl's \"horrific, tragic situation.\" \"Does the administration take responsibility for a parent taking a child on a trek through Mexico to get to this country?\" Gidley asked. \"No.\" For the latest on all the news of the week, don't miss \"Face the Nation\" (@FaceTheNation) this Sunday with Margaret Brennan (@margbrennan).

By the end of the week troops will start returning from Texas and Arizona, the beginning of a redeployment that will bring 3,000 home for the holidays.\u00a0 In the lead-up to November's midterm elections, President Trump ordered the deployment of U.S. troops to the border amid reports of incoming migrant caravans. Democrats blasted Mr. Trump's action as an expensive political ploy, while the president and his allies said it was necessary to prevent an \"invasion\" of asylum seekers and other migrants.\u00a0 In a series of tweets Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump called the operation a success. \"Despite the large Caravans that WERE forming and heading to our Country, people have not been able to get through our newly built Walls, makeshift Walls & Fences, or Border Patrol Officers & Military,\" he tweeted.\u00a0 By the holidays, the only Army troops left will be at Army North headquarters in San Antonio. In California and Arizona, aviation units will remain to transport military police to ports of entry. Aviation units in California will also be on hand to transport engineering units in California.\u00a0 \"Most forces in Texas will redeploy to their home bases to prepare for other missions...However, we have the ability to quickly reestablish support operations in Texas if needed,\" Army spokesperson Col. Cathy Wilkinson told CBS News.\u00a0 Some 5,700 troops were at the border by late November. A White House memo released that month said the troops were authorized to use lethal force, although Secretary of State James Mattis said they would not use it.\u00a0 The military deployment to the border cost $210 million, according to the Associated Press. That includes $138 million for the National Guard deployment and $72 million for active duty troops.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Less than 1 in 5 second-generation Hispanics and Latinos living in the United States believe the American Dream is \"alive and well,\" according to a recent survey commissioned by We Are All Human, a foundation focused on diversity and inclusion. The findings were released Monday at the Hispanic Leadership Summit at the United Nations. In the survey, nearly half of second-generation respondents said they believed that the American Dream was alive, \"but not what it once was.\"  Claudia Romo Edelman, founder of We Are All Human, believed the decline in confidence was a problem of representation. After November's midterm elections, the percentage of Hispanics in Congress will be just shy of 8 percent, while the share of Latinos in the total U.S. population is\u00a0estimated to be approximately 18 percent\u00a0\u2014 or nearly 58 million people. Two-thirds of those surveyed said their vote as a U.S. citizen \"didn't count.\"\u00a0 \"They haven't seen themselves represented, not in media, not politics, not anywhere,\" said Edelman in an interview with CBSN. First-generation Hispanics are more optimistic, according to the survey. Thirty-seven percent of first-generation Hispanics and Latinos survey respondents believe the American Dream is alive and well.\u00a0 Just under half of first-generation respondents believe the current state of the Hispanic community was \"very good\" to \"excellent.\" Edelman believed the survey findings called for a unification of the Hispanic community within the United States. Those who identify as Hispanic come from more than two dozen Central and South American countries, and can sometimes prioritize their home country's affiliation rather than embracing the Hispanic community as a whole, Edelman said. \"Those 26 different origins should become one, one strong Hispanic community that has a voice together and can come and express it and demand the government and corporations to show us their love,\" Edelman said. Zeno Group, a global communications firm, was commissioned by We Are All Human to conduct the Hispanic Sentiment Study, which surveyed more than 2,500 Hispanics and Latinos over the age of 14.",

            "article_content": "LONDON -- Hungary's far-right government has forced a United States-accredited university founded by the philanthropist George Soros out of the country, the college said Monday. The school, Central European University, called it \"a dark day for Europe and a dark day for Hungary.\" Central European University (CEU), established in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union, is one of the top-ranked universities in the region. According to the mission statement on its website, one of its aims is to be \"a source of support for building open and democratic societies that respect human rights and human dignity.\" It says it will be moving its U.S.-accredited programs, which account for more than 80 percent of its degrees, to Vienna, Austria. Monday's announcement came after a drawn-out battle with the increasingly authoritarian government of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, which has been cracking down on dissent in the country, as well as on organizations with links to Soros, who was born there but is now a U.S. citizen. \"This is unprecedented,\" CEU president Michael Ignatieff said in a statement. \"A U.S. institution has been driven out of a country that is a NATO ally. A European institution has been ousted from a member state of the EU.\" Soros has been demonized by Orban and his Fidesz party for years, and an anti-Soros narrative made up a large part of their election campaign. They used anti-Semitic tropes to accuse the American billionaire of being behind any number of plots, including promoting illegal immigration. Soros is Jewish and survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a child before eventually moving to the United States. Central European University is viewed by Orban as promoting liberal ideals that clash with his vision for an \"illiberal\" Christian democracy in Hungary. \"The government has never even tried to pretend that there were academic grounds for their actions,\" the university's statement said. \"Arbitrary eviction of a reputable university is a flagrant violation of academic freedom. It is a dark day for Europe and a dark day for Hungary.\" Earlier this year, Soros' other main operation in Hungary, the Open Society Foundations, moved its headquarters from Budapest to Berlin after the Orban government passed legislation \u2013 named \"Stop Soros\" \u2013 restricting the ability of NGOs to work on asylum cases. Legislation passed in 2017, which seemed to be aimed at CEU, required that all universities in Hungary have campuses in their native countries. CEU is an American-accredited institution, but did not at that time have a campus in the U.S. To comply with the law, it formed a partnership with Bard College in New York and negotiated an agreement with the Hungarian government; however the government did not sign the deal. CEU said it had to announce it was moving its U.S.-accredited programs to Vienna on Monday in order to have time to recruit students for next year. \"CEU is not\u2026 an ordinary university, because it has a specific goal\u2026 to educate people from the region and from central Asia and so on, for them to go back and democratize,\" Felix Bender, a Ph.D. student in political science at the university, told CBS News. \"It's really ironic that the country that they're in is kicking them out for those reasons.\" The European Commission said it was \"deeply concerned\" by CEU's move. It is expected to put additional pressure on Orban's allies in the European Parliament to isolate him. In September, European lawmakers voted to begin proceedings to punish Hungary for potentially violating democratic norms, partially in response to the government's moves against CEU. \"Other countries\u2026 have been closely observing the situation and checking how far one can go in silencing opposition and academics,\" Bender says. \"Now they know: There is no opposition to such methods coming from the side of the EU. And this worries me.\" The Hungarian government dismissed criticism on Monday, however. \"The Soros university is leaving but staying,\" Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, tweeted. \"It's common knowledge that a significant number of its courses will still be held in Budapest. This is nothing more than a Soros-style political bluff, which does not merit the attention of the government.\"",

Pelosi spoke briefly, introducing each new member of Congress present at the conference. She said that the new Congress would prioritize voting rights and ethical reform. Pelosi responded to a question from CBS News' Nancy Cordes about the priority for investigations next Congress. Pelosi said while Americans \"want us to address their bread and butter kitchen table issues\" like lower healthcare costs, bigger paychecks and integrity in government, \"make no mistake, oversight is a congressional responsibility.\" Pelosi also called the new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico a \"work in progress\" when she was asked if the Democrats will approve such an agreement.\u00a0 The Democrats' first bill will address voter suppression with an update to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, zero in on the integrity of government officials so members do not get \"tangled up in money\", and aim to work in a bipartisan manner with House republicans. Several new members spoke after Pelosi to outline their plan for \"tackling the culture of corruption in Congress,\" in the words of Rep.-elect Dean Phillips. Rep.-elect Veronica Escobar also said that immigration and the plight of Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria were Democratic priorities. \"We are energizing the American public to again believe in the system,\" said Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar, the first Somali American elected to Congress. Pelosi garnered enough votes to secure the nomination for speaker from her own party, although the full House still needs to approve her, and she'll need 218 votes to win the speakership during the election in January. \"We had the most unifying session,\" Pelosi said after the closed-door meeting of the House Democratic Caucus earlier this week. \"Our diversity is our strength, our unity is our power. ... Let us just take a moment to drill home the fact that we are in the majority. Majority, majority, majority.

            "article_content": "Nick Ayers could almost be confused for a college fraternity brother as he flashes a broad grin in a\u00a0selfie\u00a0taken with Mike Pence just moments after the Indiana governor was named Donald Trump's running mate. In fact, the baby-faced campaign strategist in the white undershirt had a pivotal role in Mr. Trump's selection of Pence in 2016. And two years later, Ayers' bond with Pence is stronger than ever, as are his ties to the president. A seasoned campaign veteran at age 36, Ayers is emerging as a leading contender to replace White House chief of staff John Kelly, whose departure has long been the subject of speculation. If selected, Ayers would return a political mind to the role as Trump's presidency enters a new, more perilous phase in which he fights for re-election while fending off new oversight efforts from a Democratic House. In any administration, the role of White House chief of staff is split between the responsibilities of supervising the White House and managing the man sitting in the Oval Office. Striking that balance in the turbulent times of President Trump has bedeviled both Kelly and his predecessor, Reince Priebus. If Ayers becomes the third person to tackle the job, it'll be his most significant challenge \u2014 and one friends say he's well-equipped to handle. \"He manages up as well as anyone I've ever seen,\" said Phil Cox, a former colleague at the Republican Governor's Association who bought Ayers' political consulting business earlier this year. Mr. Trump is said to have warmed to Ayers in part by watching the effectiveness of Pence's largely independent political operation. The vice president's chief of staff for the last 18 months, Ayers has earned the backing of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, for taking on the new role, White House officials said. Ayers would be the youngest chief of staff since 34-year-old Hamilton Jordan served under Jimmy Carter. But before Ayers can have his crack at leading the White House staff, he first has to overcome opposition from some who may soon work for him. On Air Force One on Sunday as Mr. Trump returned to the U.S. from a turbulent two-day trip to Paris, aides argued to the president that Ayers was the wrong person for the job, according to two people familiar with the matter, The Associated Press reports. More than a half-dozen administration aides spoke about Ayers on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel matter, the AP reports. In some corners of the White House, Ayers is viewed skeptically over how he has led Pence's office, which operates largely independent of the Trump West Wing. Some in the White House blame Ayers for planting news stories critical of the administration or its strategies, while others have complaints about his efforts to circumvent the president's political operation. Some aides have taken to calling him \"Tricky Nicky.\" Ayers didn't respond to a request for an interview from The Associated Press. But allies said he is eager to take on the chief of staff job. He and Mr. Trump have been discussing the possibility of making the switch for months. Allies said that while Ayers isn't as deeply versed in foreign policy as some of his predecessors, he had developed experience advising Pence on global affairs. He has been a frequent participant in Mr. Trump's daily intelligence briefings, occasionally even when Pence wasn't present. The timing of Kelly's expected departure isn't clear, though White House aides predict it will occur in tandem with the anticipated exit of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in the coming months. Sources familiar with the matter told CBS News Nielsen will be leaving, but say the timing is uncertain. Just last month, Mr. Trump praised her response to devastating hurricanes, and she has been a vocal advocate for the president's policies, including immigration. But sources said she could fall victim to the president's frustration that his immigration agenda has stalled. However, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway attempted to cast doubt Tuesday on the anonymously sourced reports about a staff shake-up. \"Why do they remain anonymous? Could it be that it's not completely verified and true?\" she said.",

            "article_content": "TIJUANA, Mexico -- The United States closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the busiest border crossing with Mexico to install new security barriers on Monday, a day after hundreds of Tijuana residents protested against the presence of thousands of Central American migrants. The U.S. also closed one of two pedestrian crossings at the San Ysidro crossing in a move apparently aimed at preventing any mass rush of migrants across the border. The installation of movable, wire-topped barriers threatens to complicate life for Mexicans using San Ysidro, where about 110,000 people enter the U.S. every day in 40,000 vehicles. Long lines backed up in Tijuana, where many people have to cross the border to work on the U.S. side. Such inconveniences prompted by the arrival of the migrant caravan may have played a role in Sunday's protests, when about 400 Tijuana residents waved Mexican flags, sang the Mexican national anthem and chanted \"Out! Out!\" referring to the migrant caravan that arrived in the border city last week. Tensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road -- and with many more months likely ahead of them while they seek asylum in the U.S. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000. U.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived. Some Tijuana residents supported the migrants, but others accused the migrants of being messy, ungrateful and a danger to Tijuana. They also complained about how the caravan forced its way into Mexico, calling it an \"invasion.\" And they voiced worries that their taxes might be spent to care for the group. \"We don't want them in Tijuana,\" protesters shouted. Juana Rodriguez, a housewife, said the government needs to conduct background checks on the migrants to make sure they don't have criminal records. A block away, fewer than a dozen Tijuana residents stood with signs of support for the migrants. Keyla Zamarron, a 38-year-old teacher, said the protesters don't represent her way of thinking as she held a sign saying: \"Childhood has no borders.\" Most of the migrants who have reached Tijuana via caravan in recent days set out more than a month ago from Honduras, a country of 9 million people. Dozens of migrants in the caravan who have been interviewed by Associated Press reporters have said they left their country after death threats. But the journey has been hard, and many have turned around. Alden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, told the AP on Saturday that 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision. \"We want them to return to Honduras,\" said Rivera. The migrants' expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million people to handle the influx. Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants' arrival an \"avalanche\" that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. Gastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx. Tijuana officials converted a municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city's privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000. At the municipal shelter, Josue Caseres, 24, expressed dismay at the protests against the caravan. \"We are fleeing violence,\" said the entertainer from Santa Barbara, Honduras. \"How can they think we are going to come here to be violent?\" Elsewhere on Sunday, a group of 200 migrants headed north from El Salvador, determined to also find safety in numbers to reach the U.S. Edwin Alexander Gomez, 20, told AP in San Salvador that he wants to work construction in New York, where he hears the wages are better and the city is safer. U.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in the midterm elections, used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor of Tijuana and try to discourage the migrants from seeking entry to the U.S. Trump wrote that like Tijuana, \"the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\" He followed that tweet by writing: \"Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away.\"",

Kevin McCarthy, a close ally of President Trump, said Thursday that he has not been interviewed to replace General John Kelly as White House chief of staff, and that he is focused on his new role as the House Minority Leader in the next Congress. \"No, I have not interviewed for that job,\" McCathy, who currently serves as the House Majority Leader, said in a \"CBS This Morning\" interview. \"I have a job i was just elected to.\" \"My job is to win that majority back, and I'm focused on that,\" he said. \u00a0 McCarthy, a California Republican, has cultivated a relationship with Mr. Trump. He reportedly even had had an aide pick out \u00a0pink and red Starbursts to give the president as a gift earlier this year after noticing that Trump only ate those flavors. Mr. Trump calls him \"My Kevin,\" and McCarthy's name is sometimes mentioned as a potential replacement if the president were to replace his chief of staff. House Republicans voted by a large margin Wednesday to make McCarthy their leader in the next Congress, giving him a victory over a challenge by Rep. Jim Jordan, a prominent member of the Freedom Caucus. In recent weeks, McCarthy has taken a harder line on issues such as immigration; he\u00a0proposed a bill\u00a0last month to provide full funding to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico, a campaign promise and passion project for President Trump. But McCarthy told \"CBS This Morning\" that he's focused on broadening the appeal of the Republican Party, not on hewing to conservative positions. \"We have a lot of room to grow,\" he said. Asked whether Mr. Trump's combative style hurt his party in the midterm elections, where\u00a0Democrats won control of the House, McCarthy said he is focused on moving from campaign modern to policy mode.\u00a0 \"Tone matters a lot where we're going,\" he said. He did not criticize Mr. Trump's style, though, saying that the president has racked up some bipartisan accomplishments, including work on sentencing reform. \"There are places for improvements, and there are also places he was been very successful at,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "LONDON - Like white smoke from the Vatican announcing a new pope, the signal from Britain's Cabinet table said: We have a decision. After a year and a half of negotiating with the European Union -- and fighting with itself -- the U.K. government on Wednesday backed a deal to allow Britain's orderly exit from the bloc and paint the outlines of future relations. In a hard-won victory, British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday persuaded her Cabinet to back a draft divorce agreement with the European Union, a decision that triggers the final steps on the long and rocky road to Brexit. May's fractious Conservative government agreed on a deal that solves the key outstanding issue -- how to ensure a frictionless border between the U.K.'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. The \"backstop\" plan involves keeping the U.K. in a customs union with the EU until a permanent trade treaty is worked out. It's a breakthrough, but the path to Brexit day -- just over four months away on March 29 -- remains rocky. May still faces pitfalls and threats from her domestic opponents as she tries to navigate the U.K.'s orderly exit from the EU. The prime minister hailed the Cabinet decision as a \"decisive step\" toward finalizing the exit deal with the EU within days. It sets in motion an elaborate diplomatic choreography of statements and meetings. Many in the divided Conservative Party believe May's proposal leaves  Europe with too much control over Britain's trade and borders, certainly  if the U.K. remains for any considerable period part of the bloc's  customs union. More philosophically, and perhaps more important from a  public perspective, they argue that such a deal would betray the British  public's will after the majority vote to leave the EU.  May insists her proposal delivers on key promises to reduce Europe's checks on British trade and immigration. \"We will deliver Brexit. We will not rerun the referendum,\" she vowed on the floor of the British Parliament on Wednesday. \"I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom,\" she said. And in a warning to her opponents, May added that the choice was between her deal, \"or leave with no deal; or no Brexit at all.\" The draft divorce agreement between Britain and the European Union has two parts: a legally binding withdrawal agreement, which runs more than 580 pages, and a looser political declaration on future relations. Here are some key points in the deal May got her government to agree to: Transition period: Britain will leave the EU on March 29 but remain inside the bloc's single market and be bound by its rules until the end of December 2020, while the two sides work out a new trade relationship. The transition period can be extended by joint agreement before July 1, 2020 if both parties decide more time is needed. Irish border: The deal commits the two sides to a \"backstop\" solution to guarantee the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland remains free of customs posts or other obstacles. It keeps the U.K. in a customs arrangement with the EU, and it will last until superseded by permanent new trade arrangements. Both sides said they hope to have a new deal in place by the end of 2020, so the backstop is never needed. Divorce bill: Britain agrees to cover contributions to staff pensions and commitments to EU programs the U.K. made while a member for the funding period that runs to 2020. The bill has previously been estimated at about 39 billion pounds ($50 billion). Citizens' rights: EU citizens living in Britain, and Britons elsewhere in the bloc, will continue to have the rights to live and work that they have now. The seven-page political declaration says Britain and the EU will seek a \"free trade area combining deep regulatory and customs cooperation,\" and \"ambitious, comprehensive and balanced\" arrangements for the services sector. Other ambitions include visa-free travel for short-term visits, smooth railroad, air and sea transport, and \"comprehensive, close, balanced and reciprocal law enforcement and judicial cooperation.\" Details will be worked out after the U.K. leaves the EU on March 29. Here's a look at what's likely to happen next: May is due to update Parliament on Thursday on what has been agreed,  while Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab will likely head to Brussels to meet  with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Barnier declared there has been \"decisive progress\" toward a deal --  the phrase that allows EU leaders to call a special summit to approve  the deal. They have penciled in a meeting for Nov. 25. Once the EU has signed off on it, the deal also must be approved by the European and British parliaments May hopes to get it passed by U.K. lawmakers before Christmas. Business groups warn that most U.K. companies will implement Brexit contingency plans -- cutting jobs, stockpiling goods, relocating production -- if there isn't clarity by then about the terms of Brexit. But she faces an uphill battle. May's Conservative Party doesn't hold a majority of seats in the House of Commons and relies on 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to win votes. But the DUP said it will reject any deal that treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the U.K. Several dozen pro-Brexit Conservatives have vowed to oppose any arrangement that keeps Britain in a customs union and tied to EU trade rules, indefinitely. The main opposition Labour Party also said it will oppose any deal that doesn't offer the same benefits Britain currently has as a member of the EU's single market and customs union. May is calculating that, faced with the prospect of a chaotic \"no-deal\" exit -- complete with financial turmoil, gridlock at U.K. ports and shortages of essential goods -- most Conservatives and some opposition lawmakers will crumble and support the deal. If enough senior members of  May's party balk at the deal, it could still lead to a challenge for the  leadership of the party. In Britain's version of democracy, that means  she could theoretically be unseated as Prime Minister and her entire  government replaced through a snap election.  A senior party member warned hardline Conservative \"Brexiteers\" on  Wednesday, that if they fail to back May's proposal, it could backfire  on them.  Former Conservative Party leader William Hague, who voted to \"Remain\" in  the 2016 referendum, said the public's decision must now be respected,  and warned that rejecting May's proposal in hopes of a better deal would  be inherently risky: \"If you don't take this opportunity to leave the  EU, to get Brexit over the line, you might never leave at all,\" he told  BBC's Radio 4.   If Parliament rejects the deal, Britain enters unknown territory. Lawmakers could try to send the government back to the negotiating table with the EU, though there's no simple mechanism to make that happen. They could defeat the government in a no-confidence vote in an attempt to trigger a national election. They could even vote for a new referendum on EU membership, though it seems unlikely there would be time to hold one before the U.K.'s scheduled departure date. The U.K. will cease to be an EU member on March 29 -- deal or no deal. Iain Begg, a professor at the London School of Economics' European Institute, said rejection of a deal would trigger a major political crisis because Britain's patchwork constitution offers no \"prescribed way out of that dilemma.\" He said in that case, \"we really are into a period of great uncertainty about what happens next. I think nobody can know how it would unfold.\"",

Ted Cruz said he doesn't think Congress should pass legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller, telling \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday an earlier bill to shield Mueller from removal was \"unconstitutional.\" Some of Cruz' Republican colleagues are pushing legislation to protect Mueller and his investigation after President Trump ousted former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and replaced him with Matt Whitaker as acting attorney general. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona has introduced legislation along with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Connecticut to keep the president from firing Mueller.\u00a0 Asked by moderator Margaret Brennan whether there should be legislation to protect the special counsel, Cruz responded, \"No, I don't believe there should.\" \"We had a bill come through the Judiciary Committee that tried to make it impossible for a special counsel to be removed. I believe that legislation was unconstitutional, that it was inconsistent with Article II of the Constitution,\" Cruz added.\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has describes Flake's legislation to shield Mueller as unnecessary.\u00a0 Mr. Trump berated a reporter last week on the White House South Lawn for asking whether Mr. Trump will ask Whitaker to rein in the Mueller investigation. \"What a stupid question,\" the president told CNN's Abby Phillips. But Cruz demurred on whether ending birthright citizenship through executive order would be unconstitutional. Mr. Trump has threatened to sign an executive order attempting to do just that. Asked repeatedly by Brennan whether issuing such an order and bypassing Congress would defy the Constitution, Cruz stuck to other points, focusing on the president's decision to send troops to secure the border and proclamation limiting asylum claims signed on Friday.\u00a0 \"Well, Margaret, as I said on the executive order on immigration I have not studied that or yet, it just came out this week,\" Cruz said. \"You know, I have to admit I was kind of busy we had an election a couple of days ago. And so I have not yet reviewed the executive order, and I try on legal decisions, my career has been being a constitutional litigator, so I don't reach constitutional opinions lightly.\" \"If the order defies the laws of Congress then, yes it's unconstitutional. If the order constrains and directs how the executive will implement the law then it's not,\" Cruz continued. \"Now my understanding is this executive order does things directing resources to the border. Those resources are clearly within the purview of an executive order for the president.\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "MEXICO CITY -- Thousands of Central American migrants decided to depart Mexico City early Friday and head toward the northern city of Tijuana, opting for the longer but likely safer route to the U.S. border, caravan organizers said. The decision was made late Thursday in a Mexico City stadium where roughly 5,000 migrants have spent the past few days resting, receiving medical attention and debating to how to proceed with their arduous trek.  They will proceed toward the U.S. on the heels of President Trump's latest move to tighten the nation's asylum rules, as he had\u00a0declared he would do last week\u00a0ahead of Tuesday's midterms. The administration announced on Thursday that it was moving forward with a regulation withholding asylum protection from immigrants who cross the border illegally first.\u00a0 The\u00a0interim final rule\u00a0posted by the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security would bar immigrants who cross the \"southern border unlawfully\" from \"eligibility for asylum.\" Immigrants would have to apply for asylum status at designated points of entry, and those already in the country illegally would not be able to apply.\u00a0 The announcement that the caravan would push northward on Friday, toward the official crossing at Tijuana, came shortly after caravan representatives met with officials from the local United Nations office and demanded buses to take them to the border. Caravan coordinator Milton Benitez told the migrants that they were still waiting for a response. But he later said to The Associated Press the officials had offered them buses for women and children but organizers demanded that they be for everyone. U.N. representatives could not be immediately reached to confirm this. The migrants hoped that buses would arrive for them Friday morning but decided to leave Mexico City even if they didn't. \"God, please let the buses arrive, but if not we will walk,\" said 18-year-old single mother Delia Murillo who left her girl in Honduras because she feared for her safety on the trek. Addressing the assembly in the Mexico City sports complex, organizer Walter Cuello yelled: \"Five in the morning Tijuana!\" The migrants responded with enthusiastic applause and shouts. Their plan was to walk to the central Mexican city of Queretaro on Friday. Some migrants doubted the buses would arrive. \"There will be no buses,\" said Hector Wilfredo Rosales, a 46-year-old electrician from Olancho, Honduras, who was traveling with his 16-year-old son-in-law. \"They have lied to us a lot but we will walk like we have done so far.\" Mexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, and a previous caravan in the spring opted for the longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border. \"California is the longest route but is the best border, while Texas is the closest but the worst\" border, said Jose Luis Fuentes of the National Lawyers Guild to gathered migrants. Rosales said he would have preferred a shorter route \"because there are a lot of women with children with us and it is going to be very hard.\" But he agreed with the decision to leave Mexico City and hoped people along the way would give them lifts. The migrants said they wanted buses to take them to the U.S. border because it is too hard and dangerous to continue walking and hitchhiking. Benitez noted that it would be colder in northern Mexico and it wasn't safe for the migrants to continue along highways, where drug cartels frequently operate. \"This is a humanitarian crisis and they are ignoring it,\" Benitez said as the group arrived at the U.N. office. The Central American migrants began their arduous trek toward the United States more than three weeks ago and were turned by President Trump into a campaign issue in the U.S. midterm elections. Mexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status. But most want to continue on toward the United States. Authorities say most have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries. About 85 percent of the migrants are from Honduras, while others are from the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. On Wednesday, a bus left from Mexico City to return 37 people to their countries of origin. There have already been reports of migrants on the caravan going missing, though that is often because they hitch rides on trucks that turn off on different routes, leaving them lost. The U.N. human rights agency said its office in Mexico had filed a report with prosecutors in the central state of Puebla about two buses that migrants boarded in the last leg of the trip to Mexico City early this week, and whose whereabouts are not known. In Mexico City, the migrants received medical attention and humanitarian assistance, including food, water, diapers and other basics. They searched through piles of clothes and grabbed boxes of milk for children. Marlon Ivan Mendez, a farm worker from Copan, Honduras, waited in line for donated shoes to replace the worn crocs he has used since leaving his country three weeks ago. He said he left because gangs were charging him rent to live in his own home. Mendez said it wasn't fair that people talk of the migrants as criminals or bad people with gang members in their midst. \"It is not just that the good ones pay for the sinners,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "DENVER \u2014 Voters in Colorado have elected the country's first openly gay governor. Rep. Jared Polis defeated Republican state Treasurer Walker Stapleton to keep the governor's seat in Democratic hands.    Polis, 43, is a five-term congressman and technology entrepreneur who promised to fight for universal health care, renewable energy standards and publicly funded preschool and kindergarten. He vowed to stand up to President Trump's efforts to dismantle former President Barack Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act. Polis will succeed the term-limited John Hickenlooper. Stapleton is a two-term state treasurer who campaigned on defending Colorado's constitutional restrictions on taxing and spending. The 44-year-old Stapleton insisted Polis' ideas for funding K-12 education, roads and energy would bankrupt the state. Colorado has not had a Republican governor since 2007. The state has one of the nation's lowest unemployment rates and highest rates of economic growth, largely fueled by the tech, aerospace and oil and gas industries. Polis banked on defending Obama's health care law and riding a wave of anti-Trump sentiment in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and saw overwhelming Democratic turnout in June's party primaries.  Stapleton sought to court unaffiliated voters, Colorado's largest voting bloc, by insisting that Polis would jeopardize economic growth with costly and ill-defined proposals to fund schools and roads and expand health care. He also portrayed himself as a defender of conservative fiscal policies that underlie that growth. Polis repeatedly promised to build bipartisan coalitions to invest in underfunded roads and public schools \u2014  suggesting the time has come to ask Colorado residents to loosen their strict constitutional limits on taxes and spending. Health care was a top issue in the race. Many Colorado rural and mountain towns pay some of the nation's highest insurance premiums \u2014 and have only one provider \u2014 under the Affordable Care Act. Polis, endorsed by single-payer health care proponent and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, unapologetically called for universal health care coverage as a long-term goal and suggested a first step might be to create a regional market with neighboring states. Stapleton praised President Trump's elimination of tax penalties for those without health insurance but said he would defend an expanded Medicaid program that covers one in four Colorado residents. Mr. Trump endorsed Stapleton, who embraced the administration's antipathy toward so-called sanctuary cities that don't closely cooperate with federal immigration authorities. But Stapleton sought to distance himself from the president in the campaign's final weeks, arguing that Trump's scornful tweets about immigrants, women and minorities had no bearing on policy in the governor's race. The 2018 midterms saw 26 LGBTQ candidates run for office. That includes Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, the Senate's first openly gay member, although she never made fighting for LGBTQ rights a central part of her platform. In Arizona, if Democrat Kyrsten Sinema wins, she will be the first openly bisexual woman elected to the Senate.  ",

Departing from the economic message his party had campaigned on months ago, President Trump this week\u00a0unleashed a flurry\u00a0of controversial promises to bar asylum seekers, deploy more troops to the border, overturn birthright citizenship and erect massive tent cities. The president's declarations have come at a dizzying rate, amid a\u00a0whirlwind sprint\u00a0of campaign events in tight races from Montana to Florida. The president is seeking to restore the \"tremendous momentum\" slowed, he says, by the \"maniacs\" behind last week's letter bombing and synagogue massacre. Squaring off with the president is former President Barack Obama, who in the final stretch is leading Democratic efforts to solidify the \"blue wave\" his successor has often dismissed.\u00a0 The former president joins on the stump a star-studded roster of celebrities and progressive icons that have\u00a0waded into the midterm battle, some looking to seed their own potential 2020 challenge to President Trump.\u00a0 And overseas, the White House on Friday trumpeted\u00a0crushing economic sanctions\u00a0reimposed on the Iranian regime, over the objections of Tehran and America's European allies. By contrast, the president\u00a0has said comparatively little\u00a0on potential penalties for Saudi Arabia, despite international pleas in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's gruesome murder and a brutal Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen.

And from his first day on the campaign trail until the anti-Semitic massacre on Saturday, the media appear to have the same news story logged into their computers, one in which the details change, but the ending is always the same: \u00a0\"\u2026and that's why it's all Trump's fault.\" And they mean it. From Hurricane Florence to Roseanne Barr's twitter feed to \u2014 no joke \u2014 the shooting of a congressional Republican baseball practice by an avid, anti-Trump liberal, members of the mainstream media and political culture blame it all on Trump. There's even a \"Blame Trump\" Facebook page whose mottos is literally \"Whenever something bad happens, blame Trump!!!\"  And when Republicans see President Trump blamed as the sole cause for America's ills, many of them think \"Buddy, I know exactly how you feel.\"  The lesson many Republicans have taken away from their treatment by the media and prominent Democrats over the past two decades is that they \u2014 conservatives, gun owners, Tea Party supporters, Evangelical Christians \u2014 are always going to be portrayed as the bad guys. Always. They watched John McCain, the Democrats' favorite Republican, attacked as a racist during the 2008 campaign against Barack Obama. They saw Mitt Romney, the world's biggest Boy Scout, berated as a money-grubbing sexist who counted his money as employees' family members died of cancer.  Conservatives are called racists for supporting immigration law, haters for defending their faith's long-standing views on sexuality and marriage, \"deplorables\" for not supporting President Obama's political agenda \u2014 and then they've waited (largely in vain) to see anything resembling similar treatment of politicians and pundits of the Left. In 2016, many Republicans decided that, if they're going to get called bigots and haters anyway, why not back a politician who would at least fight back on their behalf. If every argument is going to be reduced to identity politics \u2014 you can't possibly oppose Obamacare based on math, you must hate it because of Obama's race, you Republican bigots \u2014 then these voters have found a politician with whom they can truly identify. Trump is under attack, they believe, because Trump stands up for them. If he weren't president, many Republicans believe, they would still be smeared as bigots, they would still be insulted nightly on prime-time TV and by late-night comics. The only difference would be that there wouldn't be tax cuts or a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Consider an Atlantic article published the day after the Tree of Life mass shooting entitled \"Trump's Caravan Hysteria Led to This.\" How does opposing a caravan of migrants who have announced they're coming to America whether the American people like it or not cause an anti-Semitic attack in Pittsburgh? Start with the premise that mere concern about the issue is a form of  \"hysteria.\"  The idea that a nation controlling its own borders might be a completely reasonable, non-partisan position isn't even entertained. Then throw in the fact that some irresponsible or ill-informed Republicans like Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz and the American Conservative Union's Matt Schlapp have been speculating, without evidence, that the caravan might be funded by liberal activist and billionaire George Soros. \u00a0And since Soros is Jewish ... On its face, this argument is ridiculous. Soros has given hundreds of millions of dollars for causes conservatives oppose. Criticizing him is no more anti-Semitic than criticizing the libertarian Koch Brothers for funding Americans for Prosperity is anti\u2026.well, whatever religion they are. \u00a0Tom Steyer is a prominent liberal bankroller who's an Episcopalian but whose father was a non-practicing Jew.  He's spending millions trying to help Democrats take over the House and is believed to be considering a 2020 run from his party's Left flank.  Do Republicans really need a religious reason to criticize him? And yet that's exactly what they were accused of. \u00a0 Democrats attack Republican \"millionaires and billionaire\" for allegedly buying elections all the time. Nobody asks if liberal criticism of, say, Sheldon Adelson, is based on bigotry. \u00a0And yet standard-issue partisan rhetoric from the Right is immediately declared racist dog-whistling and used to condemn the entire party. Not that President Trump's rhetoric is standard issue. It's not. His attacks on Mexican-Americans and women and Muslims and pretty much everyone else are beyond anything America has ever seen from a president. \u00a0And he's been denounced for it by members of his own party.  Polls show Republican voters don't like what Trump does on Twitter.  In theory, there should be common ground for a conversation about civility. The difference is that, while Republicans are clearly uncomfortable with Trump's behavior, it's not clear at all that Democrats or the liberal media feel the same way about excesses from their own side of the aisle. It's hard to take the New York Times' calls for civility seriously when they are literally running fantasy fiction about assassinating President Trump the day the pipe bomber is caught. \u00a0Hillary Clinton's insults about the 60 million American \"deplorables\" are only criticized by Democrats for costing her votes, not for the disdain of her fellow citizens. When liberals can both demand \"when are you Republicans going to end the hate\" and cheer comedian Kathy Griffin for waving around a severed Trump head, you can't blame conservatives for doubting their sincerity. Conservatives believe that calls for increased civility are really code for \"You shut up while we bash you as bigots.\" \u00a0When op-ed writers insist it's time to \"turn down the rhetoric,\" they're speaking exclusively about the rhetoric from the Right. \u00a0Conservative talk radio could shut down tomorrow and President Trump would still be called a fascist in the pages of the Washington Post and denounced as a traitor on CNN. There is no sign that the liberals who've spent decades demeaning the character of their political opponents are prepared to stop. It should come as no surprise that their request that the targets of their attacks unilaterally disarm is met with derision and seen as self-serving, disingenuous, and, alas, futile.

            "article_content": "With the midterms just two weeks away, \"Pod Save America\" hosts Jon Favreau and Dan Pfeiffer say there's nothing not to worry about. The Obama administration alums-turned hit political podcast hosts joined \"CBS This Morning\" Tuesday to discuss the state of the Democratic Party, the midterms and whether their show \u2013 with its fair share of F-bombs and a decidedly liberal slant \u2013 contributes to the political divisiveness in our country. Asked whether the Democratic Party is going through an identity crisis, the two quickly disagreed. Though Favreau admitted there's been some \"soul searching\" after the 2016 election, both say Democrats are, at least, bonded by one thing: Trump. \u00a0 \"The party is pretty united in wanting to go vote. Have a check against Donald Trump now,\" Favreau said. \"We got a lot of things to figure out, but we're united against Trump and that's important,\" added Pfeiffer. While President Trump has focused on immigration issues to fire up his base in recent days, Democrats, Pfeiffer and Favreau contend, have turned to one of the more important issues to voters: health care.  \"I think it's very simple. It is that if Republicans keep power, they will take away people's health care and cut Medicare to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. We have to say that at every single opportunity,\" said Pfeiffer, who served as President Obama's communications director and then senior adviser. \"When you cut through the noise that's in the news and on Twitter, you look at the ads\u2026 that's what they're saying.\" Though that issue has been a key part of Democrats' platform before, Favreau feels it resonates with voters differently now. This time, he says, voters know that Republicans will try to take their health insurance away.  \"We remember what happened in 2017. And they're basically promising, [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell said it the other week, that if they win again they will now have the votes \u2013 because John McCain isn't there anymore \u2013 to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It's going to happen,\" said Favreau, who was a speechwriter for President Obama. Since the podcast's launch in 2017 it's been downloaded more than 330 million times, generating a cult-like base of listeners and spawning other podcasts and a four-part HBO series. Given the tone of our current political climate, \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King pressed the pair on what they're trying to do to bring Americans together, instead of pushing them apart.  \"What we try to do on the pod is \u2013 we're obviously liberal. We have some fun. We say what's on our mind. But we try to be factual.\u00a0 When we're not factual we try to correct it and we try to reach out to people who've never voted before or who don't usually vote,\" Favreau said.  Favreau also said he and the \"Pod Save America\" crew regularly encounter people who say the podcast got them politically active.  \"We are so fortunate to have this platform on HBO and with our podcast and what we use it \u2013 even though sometimes we get over-exuberant in language \u2013 is to encourage people who are concerned about what's happening in this country to take action and to tell them how to do it and that is what we do every day. And I think encouraging people to be citizens is the opposite of contributing to polarization. It's trying to make this a better democracy,\" Pfeiffer said. ",

            "article_content": "TAPACHULA, Mexico \u2014 President Trump is promising to stop a caravan of Central American migrants headed for the U.S. border. Mexican authorities said there are now more than 5,000 people in the caravan, including women and children. Most of them are from Honduras, fleeing poverty and violence. Border security is a hot-button topic for the president ahead of the midterm elections. He again addressed the caravan at a weekend campaign rally. \"I will seal off the border before they come into this country and I'll bring out our military, not our reserves. I'll bring out our military,\" Mr. Trump said. On Sunday, the caravan lurched forward, carrying babies, suitcases, and hope. Advocacy groups in Central America often organize these groups because the journey alone is so dangerous. CBS News saw people walking in 100 degree heat, sweating and exhausted, but also determined to reach the U.S. border still more than 1,500 miles away. In the rushing river of migrants, it's hard for families to stay together. CBS News correspondent Adriana Diaz came across two sisters separated from their parents. One sister said while she was traveling with her mother and father, they got separated and her sister is taking care of her. The woman watching over the sisters told us they were put on a truck by their mother who then disappeared into the crowd. They've since been reunited. The truck apparently drove off before the mother could get on. We found Karen Lanza looking for her son after he'd fallen behind. He eventually caught up, exhausted. They'd been walking for 10 days. To get here, most migrants crossed a river between Guatemala and Mexico. Some entered legally, through a bottle-necked bridge. Others, out of desperation, jumped off the bridge and swam across the border. We saw federal police on stand by but they did not stop illegal crossings. When the migrants finally reached the city of Tapachula, it started to rain and everyone tried to scramble for cover. Children tried to make the best of the wet chaos. Esneyder Navila sought shelter under a tarp. He's 16, alone, and has never been to school. \"Why did you leave?\" Diaz asked him. \"Because of violence, because there's no money,\" he said, adding he just wants to have an education. Amid the crying babies and hastily made meals, we reconnected with Karen and her exhausted children who told us she was thinking about turning back. She said her kids have had to deal with being hungry, but they've never had to deal with being cold and having to sleep on the floor. The migrants are on the move again today. Many Diaz spoke to say they're not slowed by President Trump's threats to use the military to stop them from entering the U.S.",

            "article_content": "By Fred Backus and Jennifer De Pinto\u00a0\u00a0 As the 2018 midterm elections loom, the partisan divide dominates the political landscape, and each side views the other with suspicion. Most Republicans believe people protesting against President Trump are being irresponsible and dangerous. Half of Democrats say the same about attendees at President Trump's rallies. In each case, these partisan views run counter to Americans' overall, who see both as generally safe and responsible. Recent events in Washington have made many Americans say they are more likely to speak up about politics (53 percent), with more Democrats (68 percent) than Republicans (51 percent) saying this.\u00a0 Current partisans feel more connected to their party than did so in 2010. Four times as many Republicans say their party reflects their values than did so in 2010, before the party gained control of the House that year. More Democrats also feel the party reflects their values today than did so in 2010. Few foresee that Americans will become more united politically in the next couple of years. Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike are in agreement on this. Partisan differences continue to mark the way Americans view many of the hot-button issues in American politics today.\u00a0 Sixty-five percent of Americans would favor offering everyone a government-run health plan like Medicare. It is supported by almost all Democrats (84 percent) and two-thirds of independents (67 percent) but is opposed by most Republicans (56 percent). Four in ten Republicans do favor it.\u00a0 Most Americans across party lines think fundamental changes are needed in the health care system, including about three in 10 who think there's so much wrong with it that it needs to be rebuilt completely. Asked who is responsible for what they dislike about the current system, six in 10 Republicans blame the Democrats for passing Obamacare in 2010, while nearly six in 10 Democrats blame the Republicans for making changes to Obamacare in 2017. Most Americans and eight in 10 Democrats see global warming as having an effect on the frequency and severity of hurricanes and tropical storms that hit the U.S., most Republicans think global warming has nothing to do with this. On global warming more broadly, Americans are increasingly coming to believe that global warming both exists and is caused mainly by human activity. Sixty-one percent now think so, a rise of seven points from just last April. Back in 2011, just 42 percent said the global warming was caused by human activity. Belief that global warming is a man-made phenomenon has risen across the board politically, though most Republicans continue to remain skeptical.\u00a0 Most Democrats (85 percent) and independents (60 percent) think global warming is caused by human activity. But while most Republicans believe global warming exists, just 34 percent think it is caused by human activity. Instead, 51 percent say it is caused by natural patterns in the earth's environment.\u00a0 In a broader view, Americans across the political spectrum say that the American way of life is disappearing, but they differ on just what constitutes that way of life. Sixty-two percent of Americans agree with the idea that the American way of life \u2013 the things that make Americans unique like its culture, values, and traditions \u2013 is in danger of disappearing.\u00a0 Republicans, Democrats, and independents all say this in equal proportions. Most Republicans and Democrats see both self-reliance and taking care of others as important parts of the American way of life, though Republicans are more likely to cite the former and Democrats, the latter. There are sharper differences on showing respect for authority (which 88 percent of Republicans call very important), and preserving the cultural heritage of America's founders (which 77 percent of Republicans call important) while Democrats are more likely to cite welcoming and accepting people of different cultures (81 percent), and the ability of people to protest authority (75 percent) are important. On immigration, Democrats overwhelmingly see immigrants as making American society better in the long run.\u00a0 Most Republicans either think they have no real impact either way or that they make American society worse. Three in four Republicans support a building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to try to stop illegal immigration, while most Democrats (and most independents) oppose it. \u00a0 Americans are also divided over the recent tax cuts passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump, though more disapprove than approve.\u00a0 Three in four Republicans approve of the new tax law, while three in four Democrats disapprove.\u00a0 This poll was conducted by telephone October 14-17, 2018 among a random sample of 1,108 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.\u00a0 Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.\u00a0 The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

            "article_content": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy says he will introduce a bill this week to fully fund a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Building the wall is a campaign promise and rallying cry for President Trump, whose support McCarthy may be seeking as the frontrunner to be the next speaker of the House. McCarthy is sponsoring the \"Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act,\" which would dedicate over $23 billion to building the border wall. The bill would also include measures to cut off funds for sanctuary cities and to facilitate deportation and detention of immigrant gang members. Breitbart, a right-wing news site, first reported that McCarthy would introduce the bill. \"For decades, America's inability to secure our borders and stop illegal immigration has encouraged millions to undertake a dangerous journey to come here in violation of our laws and created a huge loophole to the legal channels to the immigration process where America welcomes immigrants to our country,\" he said in a statement to Breitbart.\u00a0 Congress has already given $1.6 billion to build the wall, although Mr. Trump has often said at rallies that this is insufficient funding. According to Breitbart, McCarthy is hoping to leverage his bill as an issue in the midterm elections in order to rally Trump-supporting Republican voters.\u00a0 McCarthy is also running to be the next speaker of the House after current Speaker Paul Ryan steps down this year. However, he is facing an unexpectedly serious challenge from Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a hard-right member of the Freedom Caucus. McCarthy has been close to the speakership before. When former Speaker John Boehner stepped down in 2015, McCarthy was seen as his natural successor. However, his campaign crumbled due to opposition from the House's more conservative members. Ryan eventually accepted the post. McCarthy tweeted out a link to the Breitbart article discussing his bill on Tuesday.\u00a0 Few things are more fundamental to a nation than a protected border.

            "article_content": "At a rally in Topeka, Kansas, after Brett Kavanaugh was sworn into the Supreme Court, President Trump praised Kavanaugh as a \"a man of great character and intellect\" while slamming Democrats as trying to \"plunge our country into gridlock and chaos.\" Mr. Trump singled out Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker among the Democrats to criticize for \"the horror\" they put Kavanaugh and his family through. Mr. Trump again pushed claims that Warren lied about her Native American ancestry, calling her \"Pocahontas,\" and saying \"I have more Indian blood than her and I have none.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump called Blumenthal \"Da Nang Dick,\" a reference to Da Nang, Vietnam, where Americans first landed in the Vietnam War. Blumenthal served in the Marine Corps in the 1970s but did not serve in Vietnam. Blumenthal previously indicated on some occasions that he served in Vietnam. After the discrepancy in his record was revealed in 2010, he said he \"misspoken about my service, and I regret that.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump accused Blumenthal of saying there were \"men dying. Being struck by bullets. I went back and I got them,\" although Blumenthal never said that.\u00a0 On the other hand, Mr. Trump praised Republican Sen. Susan Collins, one of the crucial swing votes for Kavanaugh, as being a \"star.\"\u00a0 He did not mention Sen. Lisa Murkowski, although earlier in the day he said Alaska voters would \"never forgive\" her.\u00a0 Mr. Trump blasted Democrats and protesters who delayed or interrupted Kavanaugh's confirmation, touting his second confirmed nominee to the court in less than two years. Mr. Trump made the case that Democrats are the party of \"crime,\" while Republicans are the party of \"law and order,\" and that's why more Republicans are needed in next month's midterms.\u00a0 \"You don't hand matches to an arsonist, and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump claimed Democrats have created a bill called the \"Open Borders Bill,\" although no bill exists. He praised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as \"great Americans\" and \"tough on MS-13.\"\u00a0 The president allowed Kris Kobach, the state's far-right secretary of state who is campaigning for governor, to take the stage for a chunk of the rally. Kobach led the administration's scuttled inquiry into voter fraud in the 2016 election. Ahead of the rally, hundreds lined up outside hours beforehand, despite rain.\u00a0 The president watched the Senate vote on Kavanaugh while he was traveling on Air Force One to Kansas. He told reporters, \"I very much appreciate those 50 votes, and I think [Kavanaugh is] going to go down as a totally brilliant Supreme Court Justice for many years, many years.\" Mr. Trump also said of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were both teenagers, that he was certain that she had misidentified Kavanaugh as the perpetrator. \"I'm a hundred percent. I'm a 100%. I have no doubt,\" Mr. Trump said. Kavanaugh and Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. The confirmation vote was delayed by an FBI investigation into the allegations, which concluded in under a week. Kavanaugh was confirmed by a 50-48 vote. Kavanaugh's confirmation is even more of a triumph for the administration considering the obstacles he overcame to be confirmed. The confirmation process for Kavanaugh was complicated by allegations of sexual misconduct against him by multiple women.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson and Caroline Linton contributed to this report.\u00a0 Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Key posts overseeing the financial health of Social Security and Medicare have been vacant for more than three years, leaving the programs without independent accountability in the face of dire predictions about approaching insolvency. With Washington corroded by partisanship and consumed by political crises, gridlock has become the norm and hundreds of senior government jobs remain unfilled. For beneficiaries and taxpayers the lack of \"public trustees\" for Social Security and Medicare means a loss of outside supervision over bedrock middle-class programs. Most Americans may not even realize there's a role in government for public trustees of Social Security and Medicare, but insiders say the special advisers help keep annual financial reports honest by acting as a check on the ever-present temptation for political appointees to tweak the numbers. \"The public really doesn't have a representative sitting at the table with the government officials, and I think that is concerning,\" said Kathleen Sebelius, Health and Human Services secretary under President Barack Obama. The public trustees \u2014 one Republican, one Democrat \u2014 are usually economists or retirement experts. They join four other trustees who are senior political appointees \u2014 the secretaries of the Treasury, Health and Human Services, and Labor departments, and the Social Security commissioner. Together they oversee annual financial reports and certify that the estimates are sound and unbiased. Public trustees require Senate confirmation. Traditionally they are picked by the White House and the leadership of both parties, then nominated by the president. The White House has announced President Donald Trump's intention to nominate former Social Security official James Lockhart to fill the Republican seat; Democrats say they're working with the administration on Democratic a candidate. Trustees serve for four years, and their terms can be extended. Toward the end of his administration, Obama re-nominated the incumbent public trustees for a second term. But with 2016 elections approaching, the Senate didn't take a final vote and the posts have been vacant since. This year's Social Security and Medicare report found both programs in deteriorating health. The insolvency date for Medicare's giant inpatient trust fund moved three years closer, to 2026. For Social Security, insolvency remained unchanged for 2034. But for the first time in 36 years, the cost of the retirement program was projected to exceed its annual income in 2018, meaning reserves will be tapped to pay benefits. Nonetheless Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was upbeat. \"The programs remain secure,\" said Mnuchin's statement at the time. \"The administration's economic agenda \u2014 tax cuts, regulatory reform, and improved trade agreements\u2014 will generate the long-term growth needed to help secure these programs and lead them to a more stable path,\" he added. Mike Leavitt, health secretary under President George W. Bush, says the absence of public trustees is a symptom of deeper problems with old-age programs that Americans do not want to face. \"We have become desensitized,\" said Leavitt. Public trustees fulfill \"a piercing and profound purpose\" as \"knowledgeable private citizens empowered with information to make a declaration to their fellow citizens,\" he added. Several former public trustees said they were generally able to set aside ideological differences while working with career staff at Social Security and Medicare to validate long-range financial estimates. Those estimates are built from moving parts such as economic growth, life expectancy, hospital costs, births, immigration, disability rates and the introduction of new drugs and technologies. Social Security and Medicare combined account for nearly 40 percent of the federal budget. Social Security has more than 60 million beneficiaries, and about 60 million people are covered by Medicare. Economist Marilyn Moon, a Democratic public trustee under President Bill Clinton, said she was involved in \"pushing back pretty hard on some political appointees who wanted to make a political statement.\" Ultimately the only leverage public trustees have is to withhold their signatures from the final report. Without public trustees, professionals at Social Security and Medicare are loath to make changes in assumptions underlying the financial estimates. That means those estimates can get out-of-date, said Rick Foster, Medicare's former chief actuary, or top number-cruncher. \"The process can get a little stale,\" he said. Economist Robert Reischauer, the Democratic public trustee on the 2011-2015 reports, said, \"The closer we get to the cliff with these two programs, the more critical these positions and the integrity of the process become.\" Stephen Kellison, the Republican public trustee on the 1996-2000 reports, said Americans are being deprived of a valuable perspective on programs they cherish. \"There's going to be a hard landing, and I don't have any confidence the way Congress works today that either party can solve the problem,\" Kellison said. \"Could the public trustees be helpful? We probably need them now more than ever.\"",

            "article_content": "Thirty years after her debut, Murphy is back. A new version of the hit comedy \"Murphy Brown\" premieres Thursday night here on CBS. Lee Cowan takes a look back, and a look forward: It's been 20 years since Candice Bergen took her final bow as Murphy Brown, the fictional newswoman many real-life journalists secretly wished they could be. The show had a good, long run \u2013 ten seasons \u2013 the cast and crew earning their fake newsroom a slew of very real Emmys. When it finally ended in 1998, most thought it would go where most sitcoms go \u2026 maybe a DVD boxed set or reruns on cable.  But then came Election Night 2016. \"It was just, it was just grief, frankly ... till now!\" said Bergen laughing. Murphy is now back on the air, hosting \"Murphy in the Morning,\" just in time for the midterms.  \"Cold and flu season is approaching, so get your shots, pull out your heavy winter coats, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, stay away from drafts, please!\" Cowan asked, \"Is this, at some level, activism in a sitcom?\" \"Yes,\" said showrunner and writer Diane English.  \"We haven't really articulated that we consider ourselves 'The Resistance,' but I think that's the subtext, certainly,\" said Bergen.  \"So, if Hillary had won, you guys probably wouldn't be here?\" \"I don't think so,\" Bergen said.  English agreed: \"We didn't feel like we should go back and revisit it unless there was a real reason to do it.\" \"And this was the reason?\" \"Well, it got us pretty close, you know, but when you look at what's going on on the front page of the newspaper every day, that's what put us over the top.\" It really wouldn't work, of course, unless the rest of Murphy's gang felt the same way. \"What a perfect time for Murphy Brown, a reporter, and Frank and Corky, reporters, to come back and start covering some of the madness,\" said Joe Regalbuto, who \u2013 along with Faith Ford and Grant Shaud \u2013 was anxious to return. Cowan asked, \"Was it a strange thing to kind of re-inhabit a character that you hadn't really dealt with in 20 years?\" \"I was, like, sort of concerned about that, because my character was based on being young and in over his head,\" said Shaud. \"And I thought, if I'm sort of freaking out at my age now, is that gonna be awkward?\" \"Now you're just old and over your head?' said Ford.  \"Now I'm just old and and overwrought. And it works fine!\" Regalbuto said, \"I love the two babies talking about being old.\" Murphy's Washington watering hole, Phil's Bar, looks just like the original. The only difference now, though, is TV veteran Tyne Daley, who plays Phyllis, the barkeep serving the worst coffee in town.  Murphy's Georgetown townhouse had to be re-created, too. What was it like walking onto the set for the first time? \"Tears came to my eyes because it's almost identical to the set that we had when we started 30 years ago,\" Bergen said.  Regalbuto said, \"I walked in with Faith, and Candice was already crying on the set. Faith started crying.\"  \"I was a heap,\" Ford laughed. \"I was just a heap. I wasn't expecting it.\" \"We're home again,\" said Regalbuto. \"And you don't go home again. But we came home again.\" But what does it mean to be home again in such different times? There were tough issues in the '90s, and the show dealt with them \u2013 everything from alcoholism to cancer. Diane English hopes the new \"Murphy Brown\" will be even more topical. Storylines already include gun control, immigration, and sexual harassment. Murphy: \"Hello, the show's called 'Murphy in the Morning.' They're not firing me!\"Harassment Trainer: \"Do the names Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose and Bill O'Reilly ring any bells?\"Audience: \"Oooooooh\" \"We have 13 episodes, we're here to make some noise,\" said English. \"We're expecting a certain amount of backlash, yeah. But you know, we used to get it in old days, too.\" Most notably back in 1992, when Murphy became a single mom, which brought this famous rebuke from then-Vice President Dan Quayle: \"Bearing babies irresponsibly is simply wrong. Primetime TV has Murphy Brown mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice.\"  Some of the new cast members aren't even old enough to remember that backlash, including Jake McDorman, who plays Murphy's son, now all grown up. \"Actually hadn't seen any of the original series,\" said McDorman. \u00a0\"I mean, I knew about it, but I hadn't seen any of it.\" Cowan asked, \"Did you go back and then look at some of the older episodes?\" \"Not until after we filmed the first episode, which was a smart move because it's intimidatingly good!\" What may be most intimidating, however, is the idea of the current White House reacting. New cast members Nik Dodani and Adan Rocha say they're both \"terrified\" Rocha's character is especially timely \u2013 he plays an immigrant in constant fear of being deported.  Dodani plays the newsroom's social media guru. In real life, however, he thinks he's better off not knowing what the White House might say. \"I deactivated my Twitter,\" Dodani said. \"It's my message to America \u2013 delete your Twitter!\" With just days to go before the premiere, you might expect nerves to be a little raw, and they are.  Cowan said, \"I imagine because the expectations are so high, maybe impossibly high...\" \"You had to bring that up,\" Bergen laughed.  The last three episodes aren't even written yet, by design, so the show can be flexible enough to respond to news of the day.  Bergen said, \"Every show night I start getting all weepy, and Faith comes in, she says: 'Now, can-do, You can do this.' I know, but it's so much!\" \"Why do you get weepy though?\" \"The show was so important to so many of us when we were doing it, and you really connect on a level that's deeper, I think, than usual.\" The world is perhaps more polarized than it was when Murphy was last on the air, but Candice Bergen, and the rest of the cast, are counting on the fact that somewhere in the middle of the left and the right, there's still a little room for humor.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0See also:\u00a0 For more info:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Story produced by Jay Kernis.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "In the six-decade history of \"Face the Nation,\" Sen. John McCain was our most frequent guest, with 112 total appearances. Former moderator Bob Schieffer, who conducted most of those interviews, looks back on some of McCain's memorable Sunday morning appearances and his impact on American life. Americans first came to know John McCain as a Navy pilot, shot down in 1967 over North Vietnam. As a prisoner of war, his captors tortured him for five and a half years. When they learned he was a famous admiral's son, they tried to release him for propaganda purposes but he refused to go until the other prisoners were freed. It was typical of the courage that marked his long political life. Through two presidential campaigns and decades in the Senate, he became one of the best-known politicians in America and was never afraid to cross party lines.\u00a0 \"Independents, Democrats, libertarians, vegetarians, come on over! Vote for me!\" he said during the 2000 presidential race. In 1985, he made his first appearance on \"Face the Nation.\" By 2008, he had set a record for the most appearances on the broadcast. He did it on the Sunday after winning the Republican presidential nomination, with what may have been be the most unusual strategy in political history. \"We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave into the temptations of corruption,\" McCain said when accepting his party's nomination at that year's convention. He said his party had lost its way and was part of the country's problem. \"We came to power to change Washington and Washington changed us,\" he told \"Face the Nation\" in September 2008.\u00a0 The general election campaign proved to be as unusual as his fight for the Republican nomination.\u00a0 At one point he found himself defending his opponent Barack Obama's honor, calling him a \"decent person\" after a supporter called Obama \"Arab.\" \"No ma'am. No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues and that's what this campaign is all about,\" he said at a town hall meeting. McCain hoped to win the presidency by attracting independent swing voters. To do that, he toyed with making independent Democrat Joe Lieberman his running mate. Advisers talked him out of it. Instead, they recommended little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Her gaffe-prone campaign ended whatever chance he had to win independents. Add on to that a bad economy and he lost in a landslide.\u00a0 McCain got over it by plunging into his work in the Senate where he championed causes large and small, sometimes causes his own party wanted no part of.\u00a0 It was former prisoner of war McCain who took on many Republicans to declare America could never condone torture, even against our worst enemies.\u00a0 \"It's not about them. It's about us. It's about us \u2014 what we were, what we are and what we should be,\" McCain told \"Face the Nation\" in 2014. \"And that's a nation that does not engage in these kinds of violations of the fundamental basic human rights that we guaranteed when we declared our independence.\" Americans were shocked during the 2016 campaign when Republican candidate Donald Trump attacked him, saying McCain was \"a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured.\"\u00a0 McCain stayed above the fray during the controversy that ensued, but his relationship with Trump was never warm. He was the deciding vote that killed the new president's plan to repeal Obamacare.\u00a0 For McCain, it was always about the issue, seldom about who sided with him. He could be Senate's fiercest critic, but he loved the place, respected its rules and maintained friendships with his toughest opponents \u2014 like the late Democratic senator, Ted Kennedy. \u00a0 \"Oh, we had some great bouts there, and yet I remember one time we had a huge fight that two freshmen had begun and we drove them from the floor and afterwards, we were walking off the floor and he put his arm around me and he said, 'We really did a good one that time, didn't we, John?'\" McCain recalled in 2015.\u00a0 When he and Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer were working to find a compromise on immigration, I remarked it was the first time they had appeared on the \"Face the Nation\" set together. What I didn't say was that it was McCain who had convinced Schumer to cancel travel plans and stay in Washington to show solidarity.\u00a0 When Hillary Clinton called him \"her favorite Republican\" as she was preparing to run for president, I asked McCain the obvious question: \"Is she your favorite Democrat?\" McCain replied: \"Actually, I hope this program is blacked out in Arizona, please cut. Look, I respect Secretary, Senator Clinton. I respect her views. We have had disagreements on a number of issues but I think it's my job to work with every president, if she is regrettably, if she attains the presidency.\" As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, McCain flew to battlefields and trouble spots around the world. When Ukraine became dangerous, I questioned his decision to go to Kiev.\u00a0 \"I always feel safe, Bob. I've told you in the past, I know that I'm going to die but it's only going to be in bed,\" said McCain in 2013.\u00a0 I always felt John McCain had no more fear of death than he had of taking on an uphill political fight, and to the end he fought every fight with every ounce of energy that time allowed.\u00a0 And he was still fighting when time ran out.\u00a0 So John McCain's voice is stilled, but how he lived his life will always speak volumes about service to our country, our obligation to others and most of all about having the courage \u2014 no matter the consequences \u2014 to stand up for what we believe is right.\u00a0 John McCain appeared on \"Face the Nation\" 112 times. Bob Schieffer is a CBS News political contributor and former anchor of \"Face The Nation,\" which he moderated for 24 years before retiring in 2015.",

            "article_content": "President Trump criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Twitter Saturday morning. The president has expressed frustration with Sessions multiple times this week as former allies have become embroiled in investigations. \"Jeff Sessions said he wouldn't allow politics to influence him only because he doesn't understand what is happening underneath his command position,\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Saturday.\u00a0 The tweet follows a week in which former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was\u00a0found guilty\u00a0of eight financial crimes, the first trial victory by prosecutors in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into  Mr. Trump's associates. On the same day, former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0to eight counts including two campaign finance violations involving payments to silence women. In his tweet, Mr Trump said, \"Highly conflicted Bob Mueller and his gang of 17 Angry Dems are having a field day as real corruption goes untouched. No Collusion!\" (Thirteen of the 17 staff attorneys on Mueller's team have previously been registered as Democrats, although Mueller himself is a Republican.) Jeff Sessions said he wouldn\u2019t allow politics to influence him only because he doesn\u2019t understand what is happening underneath his command position. Highly conflicted Bob Mueller and his gang of 17 Angry Dems are having a field day as real corruption goes untouched. No Collusion! In regard to Sessions, Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to a statement Sessions released on Thursday\u00a0in which he said he would \"not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\" That was a response to Mr. Trump's interview with \"Fox & Friends\" Thursday morning in which Mr. Trump said Sessions never \"took control\" of the Justice Department.\u00a0 The president's frustration with his attorney general stems from Sessions' recusal from the Russia investigation, which led to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller last year. \"I put an attorney general in that never took control of the Justice Department, Jeff Sessions, never took control of the Justice Department and it's sort of an incredible thing,\" Mr. Trump told \"Fox & Friends\" Thursday. In his statement responding to the interview, Sessions said Thursday,\u00a0\"I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the president's agenda\u2014one that protects the safety and security and rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty.\" Mr. Trump again tweeted his frustration with Sessions Friday. \"Jeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the \"other side,\"\" Mr. Trump said in response to Sessions' statement. \"Come on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting!\" \u201cDepartment of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\u201d Jeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the \u201cother side\u201d including deleted Emails, Comey lies & leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr...... ....FISA abuse, Christopher Steele & his phony and corrupt Dossier, the Clinton Foundation, illegal surveillance of Trump Campaign, Russian collusion by Dems - and so much more. Open up the papers & documents without redaction? Come on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting! Mr. Trump also tweeted on Saturday about Hillary Clinton and the FBI.\u00a0 \"Big story out that the FBI ignored tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails, many of which are REALLY BAD.

            "article_content": "Editor's Note: This story has been updated with more detail on the Republican attorneys general lawsuit to strike down the Affordable Care Act and the legislation proposed by Republican senators on pre-existing conditions. \u00a0 Under increasing pressure by Democratic groups and candidates, a number of Senate Republican candidates in competitive races\u00a0have begun talking about health care in the last week. GOP nominees in Missouri, West Virginia, Montana, North Dakota and Florida are all voicing their support through social media and op-eds for a health care plan that protects patients with pre-existing conditions. It's a far different message from 2016, when Republicans campaigned on a promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Though GOP lawmakers, with majorities in the House and Senate, tried to end the ACA, they did not succeed. While most Republican candidates this cycle have focused on tax cuts and immigration, Democrats have been campaigning aggressively on health care, an issue voters care deeply about. An August\u00a0CBS News Poll\u00a0found that health care is the item voters may be the least willing to compromise on, with three in four saying a candidate must agree with them on health care to get their vote.\u00a0 Senate candidate and current Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley addressed pre-existing conditions last week in an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0in the Springfield News-Leader calling for better health care legislation. \"Insurers should also be required to cover individuals with preexisting conditions and young people on their parents' insurance, up to age 26,\" Hawley wrote in the proposal. \u00a0 Hawley's op-ed came after his opponent Senator Claire McCaskill traveled across the state campaigning on the need to protect health care. McCaskill has held seven roundtables on health care alone in the last two months. She has slammed Hawley for signing onto a lawsuit with 19 Republican attorneys general to declare the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which protects individuals with pre-existing conditions, unconstitutional on the basis of the nullification of the individual mandate tax penalty by Congress last year when it passed its tax cut bill.\u00a0 \"Josh Hawley decided to use your taxpayer dollars to file a lawsuit that would take away important prescription drug coverage for seniors through Medicare and end all of the consumer protections under the ACA \u2014 including protections for Missourians with pre-existing conditions such as asthma, high blood pressure, cancer or diabetes,\" she wrote in an op-ed last week. In fact, a filing last month in the GOP attorneys general lawsuit targets the pre-existing conditions provision. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who's leading the lawsuit against the ACA, asked the court to\u00a0strike the ACA's requirement that pre-existing conditions be covered by insurers, even if the judge allows the health care law to stand.\u00a0 Hawley isn't the only candidate who's sounding new notes on health care.\u00a0Patrick Morrisey\u00a0in West Virginia, Gov.\u00a0Rick Scott\u00a0in Florida, Rep.\u00a0Kevin Cramer\u00a0in North Dakota, and\u00a0Matt Rosendale\u00a0in Montana have also tweeted out their support for covering preexisting conditions. All four men are Republican candidates who are challenging Democratic incumbents running for reelection in states President Trump won in the 2016 election. The change in campaign messaging aligns with a new proposal in Washington co-sponsored last week by Sen. Dean Heller, who faces a tough reelection fight. Heller and 10 other Republicans introduced a bill on Thursday to address pre-existing conditions. Heller, like Cramer in North Dakota, voted to repeal the ACA, which included insurance guarantees for people with pre-existing conditions.\u00a0 But while the bill would keep individual market insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, or charging them more, the Wall Street Journal points out that \"insurers would still be able to exclude any coverage related to that condition, however, and could vary premiums based on age and gender.\" Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow on health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which supports the ACA, also said the bill would not completely prohibit insurance companies from excluding coverage for patients with preexisting conditions. She explained that the ACA prohibited insurance companies from discriminating against patients with preexisting conditions in three ways \u2013 turning the patient down, charging the patient more, and excluding the coverage for the preexisting condition the patient has. Pollitz's assessment matches the Journal's -- that Heller's legislation only touches the first two, not the third. Under the GOP legislation, she explained, an insurance company could offer a cancer patient a policy that doesn't charge more simply because she is a cancer patient but wouldn't have to cover the care for cancer.\u00a0 Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) spokesman David Bergstein derided the legislation in a statement,\u00a0 calling it \"a sham bill that doesn't actually do anything and won't save Republican Senate Candidates.\" The National Republican Senatorial Committee did not return CBS News' request for comment.\u00a0 The Senate could bring up the legislation when it returns after Labor Day, but it's unlikely because lawmakers have a packed agenda that includes confirming Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanagh, averting a government shutdown, and potentially drafting a new NAFTA deal.",

            "article_content": "By Jennifer De Pinto, Anthony Salvanto, Kabir Khanna, Fred Backus\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As a record number of women throw their hat in the political ring, women voters in battleground congressional districts are five times as likely to say they would choose a woman candidate (28%) over a man (5%) if both candidates agreed with them on policy and party. Men say they would choose a woman over a man as well, although by a smaller margin. Still, a majority of voters \u2013 both men and women \u2013 say a candidate's gender wouldn't matter. Preference for a woman candidate is driven by Democrats. Democratic women (42%) are about three times as likely as Republican women (15%) to say they would choose the woman candidate in a race where both the man and the women shared their views. Women voters who prefer a woman candidate over a man cite that women might be have a better understanding of the issues they care about (40%) and having more diversity in politics (39%) as their top reasons why. Most voters view men and women as equal, not one better than the other, on a number of political attributes. For those who do pick a gender, more say women are better than men at finding ways to compromise and being honest and ethical. Both men and women voters hold these views.  These opinions may be informed by how Democratic and Republican women perceive gender equality in general. 70% of Democratic women say that men have more advantages than women do in society today, while 60% of Republican women say there's no advantage in either being a man or a woman.  As women make their voting decision, sending a message to Washington is a bigger factor for women intending to vote Democratic (71%) than it is for those supporting Republicans (62%). Fewer women say making sure the opposing party loses is a big factor, but most say it's a part of their decision-making. Above all, a big part of women's vote decision is trying to support policies and legislation that they want.\u00a0 Whether they are planning to vote for a Democrat or a Republican for the House of Representatives this year, about nine in 10 say supporting policies they want is a big factor. By 2 to 1, women trust the Democratic Party over the Republican Party on issues that impact women. Moderate and independent women give the Democratic Party the advantage here too, although compared to party stalwarts, fewer of these women say they trust either party on women's issues. Health care is the issue women voters appear to consider most crucial to win their support. Nearly eight in 10 (78%) say a candidate must agree with them on this in order to get their vote, with Democratic women (86%) more so than independents (76%) and Republicans (73%).  Women across party lines express a lot of concern about the cost of health care, with Republican women having the most concern. Making sure everyone has health care coverage is far more of a concern for Democrats than Republicans. Democrats (85%) are more than twice as likely as Republicans (32%) to be concerned a lot about that.  There's also a partisan divide in how women view immigration. Democratic women are more concerned with immigrants being treated fairly, while Republican women are more concerned with keeping the wrong people out of the country.  The CBS News 2018 Battleground Tracker is a panel study based on interviews conducted of registered voters in 57 competitive and likely competitive congressional districts in the United States. The poll was conducted by YouGov, an online polling company. This poll was fielded between August 10\u201316, 2018 with 4,989 respondents. The respondents were selected from YouGov's online panels to be representative of registered voters in these districts in terms of age, race, gender, and education. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the American Community Survey, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, as well as 2016 Presidential vote, and post-stratified on district type.\u00a0 Poll toplines",

            "article_content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Businessman Bill Lee defeated three other Republicans in a bruising primary for Tennessee governor Thursday, setting the stage for a competitive fall contest against former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean, who cruised to the Democratic nomination. In the race for retiring Sen. Bob Corker's seat, U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn won the GOP nomination and former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen won the Democratic nomination.\u00a0 Lee spent just $7 million through late July, a third of what former state economic development commissioner Randy Boyd shelled out and half of what U.S. Rep. Diane Black spent. In all, the Republican race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Bill Haslam added up to a record-shattering $45 million-plus in spending.  Throughout his campaign, Lee touted himself as the race's only conservative outsider, focused heavily on his relationship with Jesus Christ and talked about his cattle farm and his family business. He rode a tractor across the state to draw focus on rural issues.\u00a0 \"I am someone who is not a politician, but I do have a vision for Tennessee to lead the nation,\" Lee told supporters during his victory speech.\u00a0 Once Boyd and Black started hitting him in TV ads, Lee banked on a different approach to avoid overtly blasting his opponents. Lee ran ads saying attacks against him aren't what a leader does and some people will say or do anything to get elected. The Franklin businessman argued he had three politicians attacking him because he was winning.  \"We didn't go down that road and I'm not gonna start now,\" Lee said of the attacks.  On the Democratic side, Dean had a huge advantage in campaign cash and outspent Fitzhugh $4.4 million to $984,800. The Democratic race was mostly cordial, aside from a few squabbles.  Dean will put forward his message of bipartisanship to try to peel off moderate Republicans and independents in a state that favored President Trump by 26 percentage points in 2016. He said that though places like Nashville are thriving, many people in other areas struggle because of a lack of jobs, hospital closings and high poverty.  \"There is still work that we need to do for the forgotten Tennessee, and that's where my energies will be,\" Dean said.  The GOP candidates aimed to paint themselves as most devoted to Trump and his tough-on-immigration priorities, questioning each other's allegiance to the president and his policies down the homestretch of a close race.  Each candidate added millions of dollars of personal wealth to their campaigns, amounting to $40 million total. Lee used the third-least amount of personal cash in the field, having loaned his campaign $5.3 million compared to Boyd's personal contributions totaling $19.5 million and Black's $12.3 million infusion of wealth.  Dean has tapped into about $1.5 million total of his own money.  Lee is the chairman of his family business, Lee Company, a $225 million mechanical contracting, facilities and home services firm with more than 1,200 employees.  Black was considered the early leader in the race, but struggled down the homestretch amid a TV ad war with Boyd in which she was labeled \"D.C. Diane.\"  She was on pace to finish third despite Vice President Mike Pence tweeting his support for Black last week.  Mr. Trump stopped short of endorsing Black, but he kept the Gallatin lawmaker by his side and praised her during several key news events. She earned Mr. Trump's praise in part by pushing through his tax law while she served as the House Budget Committee chairwoman. She made that role a focal point of her campaign and TV ads.  \"Sometimes, God just sets a different course for you than what you set for yourself,\" Black said in her concession speech. Democrats, meanwhile, see the open Senate seat as critical to their hopes of taking control of the Senate.\u00a0 Blackburn easily advanced past minimal opposition in Thursday's primary. She and Bredesen have long looked past the primary to an expected general election matchup. The race holds major implications for Democrats' chances for overturning the 51-49 Republican Senate majority. Polls have shown a close contest for the seat. Blackburn could become the first female U.S. senator elected by Tennessee voters. She calls herself a \"hardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative\" who would fight for President Trump's agenda. Bredesen blew past nominal opposition in Thursday's primary, as expected. Bredesen is running as an independent thinker who says he will work with Mr. Trump when his ideas make sense for Tennessee and oppose him when they don't. Election officials said early voting for the primary election was up by 11 percent statewide, CBS Nashville affiliate WTVF-TV reports. Some voters told WTVF-TV they're concerned about Russian meddling and that may be affecting voter turnout. State officials, however, have been hoping to ease some of that concern. \"In regards to cybersecurity, that's a concern any time,\" said Tennessee's election coordinator Mark Goins. \"You have to consider yourself a target, and we do. We feel like we're a target so we protect ourselves like we're a target, and we take measures to prevent those things.\"",

            "article_content": "What does Chris Pappas know that Bernie Sanders doesn't? You know Sanders, the self-proclaimed socialist who almost snared the Democratic nomination (some would say he was cheated out of it) in 2016.\u00a0 He was on the campaign trail in Kansas this weekend with the new rising star of the Sanders Left, soon-to-be Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York. Together they championed the causes of Abolishing ICE, Impeaching Trump and #MedicareForAll.\u00a0 And who is Chris Pappas? He's one of the many Democrats running in swing districts across the U.S. whom you haven't heard of. Considered a front-runner in the primary to replace retiring Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, D-New Hampshire, Pappas is on the ground in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District, going door-to-door and talking to voters. And interestingly\u2014he's not\u00a0supporting Medicare for all. Not preaching immediate impeachment, and pointedly not promising to shut down the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\u00a0 And he's also not alone. As Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez headed to the heartland to sell their Democratic Socialist vision of the party, the center-left Democratic think tank Third Way was wrapping up its meeting in Columbus, Ohio. Hundreds of politicians, activists and party members concerned that anti-Trump activism may push Democrats too far to the Left. \"Once again, the time has come to mend, but not end, capitalism for a new era,\" said Jonathan Cowan, Third Way's president.\u00a0 \"80s supply-sidism, 90s centrism and 60s socialism will not cut it for the era we're in. We need something new and different.\" Candidates like Ocasio-Cortez don't agree. In a joint appearance with Sanders on CBS News' \"Face The Nation\" this Sunday, she told host Margaret Brennan \"the factors that ultimately created our win was the fact that we had bold commitments and I campaigned on hard commitments of Medicare for all, tuition-free public college, ensuring a Green New Deal for our future.\" Free health care, free college, government-guaranteed jobs for all\u2014the fact that those ideas are in the mainstream of the American political debate is a significant development. But some Democrats have a sneaking suspicion that these issues are more popular in deep-blue districts like San Francisco or college towns like Amherst, Massachusetts, than in the rest of the country. When House Democrats rolled out their #MedicareForAll caucus last week, conspicuously absent were House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and other top members of the Democrats' House leadership. Meanwhile, Republicans already have a strategy in place if becomes a centerpiece of the 2018 campaign: \"Hands Off My Medicare.\" \"It would break Medicare,\" said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. \"And it would end any private insurance as we know it.\" GOP members are also quick to point out the price tag: From $1.4 to $2.8 trillion a year. And what about \"free\" college?\u00a0 And a guaranteed jobs program?\u00a0 Those would cost hundreds of billions more.\u00a0 Members of the socialist-friendly end of the Democratic coalition say the bill will be covered by \"millionaires and billionaires,\" but moderate, swing-district voters may not be so sure. Even an outspoken liberal like former Starbucks CEO\u00a0 (and potential 2020 presidential candidate) Howard Schultz has his doubts. \"It concerns me that so many voices within the Democratic Party are going so far to the left,\" he said in an interview last month.\u00a0 \"I say to myself, 'How are we going to pay for these things,' in terms of things like single payer [and] people espousing the fact that the government is going to give everyone a job. I don't think that's realistic.\" Even in deep-blue Massachusetts there are concerns about the Democratic Socialist message. Asked if Ocasio-Cortez represents the future for his party, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton said hers is an \"important\" voice, but not the only one. \"I think that she has an important voice in the Democratic Party, but the reality is that if we are going to be a majority party, if we are actually going to win in November, we've got to have a diversity of views, and I think that's one of the things that's made our party strong in the past,\" Moulton said. \"But if we become narrower. If we become more divided, then we can do that as Democrats, we are just not going to win.\" The outcomes of special elections since Trump's inauguration show Democrats are clearly on a winning streak. And the passion\u2014not to mention fundraising power\u2014of progressives like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez accurately reflect the mood of their party's base. \"There is no question there is a lot of volume and emotion and energy around the more activist wing of our party,\" said Jim Himes, D-Connecticut, chairman of business-oriented New Democrats coalition. The question is whether the millions of swing voters\u2014the people who will determine who controls the House in 2019--feel the same.

            "article_content": "Thousands of people marched yesterday in Nicaragua to demand that President Daniel Ortega step down. The demonstrations over proposed benefit cuts, which began three months ago, are expected to continue today.  Human rights groups say about 300 people have been killed during the protests, many by police. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has warned that deadly clashes in Managua could lead to civil war, and worsen the immigration crisis in the U.S.  CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez reports an eerie quiet during much of the day in the capital city of Managua, as people stay home and business owners close up shop for their own safety. But after the calm, the sounds of protest pierce the air, and the fear of bloody confrontations returns. Within minutes of arriving in the capital, Bojorquez encountered an anti-government protest and the sound of mortar fire.  Several young men \u2013 masked and holding homemade mortar launchers \u2013 told Bojorquez they fire the mortars to warn fellow demonstrators when pro-government forces are near. They told Bojorquez that they were willing to risk their lives: \"The fear is gone,\" one said.  The fear was gone on April 19 \u2013 that's the day protests started over proposed cuts to social security benefits. Government forces are accused of killing more than 40 people that week. Hundreds have been killed since then, some even attacked while hiding in a church. The uprising continues to intensify against President Ortega, whom demonstrators say has turned into a dictator and should step down. But Ortega remains defiant, insisting the protesters are being influenced by outside forces and blaming them for initiating the violence.  In the neighborhood of Monimbo, which had been a stronghold of the opposition, barricades built using cobblestones from the streets can still be seen. It was the site of a bloody confrontation with police last week. At this point, it's still not clear how many people were killed. One woman feared being identified on camera, but wanted to let Bojorquez know one thing: her neighborhood was not backing down \u2013 that Monimbo had lost the battle, but not the war. Several international organizations have called on the Nicaraguan government to end the violent suppression of protests and for President Ortega to allow early elections next year. He refuses to back down, which means the protests are likely to continue.",

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama, in a speech honoring the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, said he'd try to \"get some perspective\" as news cycles bring \"more head-spinning and disturbing headlines.\" \"Given the strange and uncertain times that we are in -- and they are strange and they are uncertain -- each day's news cycle bringing more head spinning and disturbing headlines -- I thought maybe it would be useful to step back for a moment and try to get some perspective,\" the former president said in the keynote Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, in Johannesburg, South Africa. His comments, while largely focused on Mandela's life as a leader and the road ahead for global democracy, offered veiled criticism of the political climate currently taking place in the United States. His remarks also come just one day after President Trump appeared to fault the U.S. for Russia's role in meddling in the 2016 election after holding a day-long summit with known adversary Russian President Vladimir Putin. Obama said that it was \"surprising\" to him that he had to reaffirm to the audience that \"we are all human, our differences are all superficial and that we should treat each other with care and respect.\" \"I would have thought we would have figured that out by now. I thought that basic notion was well-established, turns out in this recent drift in reactionary politics, the struggle for basic justice is never truly finished.\" Without explicitly naming any politicians of today, the politics of \"fear and resentment and retrenchment\" is \"now on the move.\" \"It's on a move at a pace that would have seemed unimaginable just a few years ago. I am not being alarmist I am simply stating the facts,\" he said, adding that \"strongmen politics\" are suddenly ascending. \"The free press is under attack, censorship and state control of media is the rise, social media once seen as a mechanisms to promote knowledge and understanding and solidarity proved to be just as effective promoting hatred and paranoia and propaganda and conspiracy theories,\" he added. Highlighting the rise in extremist politics, Obama suggested that those on the fringes should instead \"check the history books\", noting those who embraced \"rabid nationalism and xenophobia or religious superiority\" often fell victim to civil war. The president went on, saying that \"too much of politics of today seems to reject the very concept of objective truth.\" \"People just make stuff up!\" he exclaimed, adding that there's an \"utter loss of shame among political leaders when they're caught in a lie and they just double down and lie some more.\" \"Politicians have always lied, but it used to be if you caught them lying, they'd be like, 'oh man!' Now they just keep on lying,\" he said to laughs from the crowd. Obama also highlighted the ongoing debate over immigration, again without naming Mr. Trump, saying that existing laws need to be enforced and followed but all \"while respecting humanity.\" He said that it was \"not wrong\" to insist that national borders matter, but that it can't be an \"excuse\" to implement immigration policies \"based on race or ethnicity or religion.\" Obama, however, suggested that on Mandela's 100th birthday, the world now \"stands a crossroad\" and that the world should respond to threats to global democracy appropriately. \"I believe in Nelson Mandela's vision, I believe in a vision shared by Ghandi and King and Abraham Lincoln, I believe in a vision of equality and justice and freedom and multi-racial democracy based on a premise that all people are created equally,\" Obama said to rousing applause. He added, \"I belive we have no choice but to move forward, that those of us who belive in democracy and civil rights have a better story to tell.\" \"So if were truly to continue Madiba's long walk toward freedom, we're going to have to to work harder, we're going to have to be smarter. We're going to have to learn from the mistakes of the recent past,\" said Obama. He said that while it may be \"tempting to give into cynicism\" the world must \"resist\" such negative thinking \"because we've been though darker times. We've been in lower valleys.\" \"Keep believing, keep marching, keep building, keep raising your voice, every generation has the opportunity to remake the world,\" he charged the crowd. \"Now's a good time to be fired up.\"",

            "article_content": "Regarded as a savior to many Vietnam War refugees and as a political centrist willing to cross party lines, former Iowa Gov. Robert D. Ray will be remembered at a funeral Friday as a beloved leader \u2014 who likely would have a tough time being elected in today's political climate. As Iowa residents of all political stripes reflect on the Republican governor's 14-year bipartisan legacy, many acknowledge that the qualities that made Ray so respected and effective would largely disqualify him as a politician today, reflecting dramatic changes in state and national politics in the 35 years since he left office. \"I find it hard to think that, in either party, that Bob Ray would be welcome,\" said Kenneth Quinn, president of the World Food Price Foundation and a former U.S. ambassador to Cambodia who worked on refugee resettlements as a member of the Ray administration. Plenty of people welcome a political leader modeled off Ray, Quinn said, but such a politician couldn't advance through either party's nominating process. He said that's one reason Ray's death has prompted such an outpouring of respect and affection for the governor, who was first elected in 1968. Ray\u00a0died Sunday\u00a0at age 89. \"There's a lot of people in both parties who together would find someone like Bob Ray very attractive,\" Quinn said. On Thursday, Ray became the first Iowa official to lie in state at the Capitol in over six decades \u2014 since Gov. William S. Beardsley died in office in 1954. Ray and his state were catapulted to national prominence in 1974, when he broke with other governors and encouraged Tai Dam refugees and later other Vietnam War refugees to move to Iowa. He did so despite concerns among some of his constituents that the refugees \u2014 who entered the U.S. legally with the support of the federal government \u2014 would take jobs and other resources away from existing Iowa residents. Ray defended the resettlements on moral grounds in a 1979 speech in St. Louis, invoking the memory of the United States refusing asylum\u00a0in 1939 for Jews fleeing Nazi Germany. He also described his experience watching people die around him in a Cambodian refugee camp. \"If we don't have the heart, or the spirit, to save human lives, then how can we be expected to help those whose lives are already assured?\" Ray asked. Som Baccam, a Democratic community leader who knew Ray well after coming to Iowa in 1975 as a refugee from Laos, said Ray is regarded as a savior by many in the state's Southeast Asian community. She said he was fair-minded with a \"bipartisan heart\" that could bring people together. Matt Walsh, a history professor at Des Moines Area Community College who wrote a book on Ray's resettlement of Tai Dam refugees, said Ray's action on immigration contrasts with modern politicians. He cited former Gov. Terry Branstad's order for state agencies to stop working to resettle Syrian refugees in Iowa following\u00a0a 2015 terrorist attack in Paris\u00a0. Branstad served as lieutenant governor during Ray's tenure and\u00a0was named\u00a0by Trump as U.S. ambassador to China. Walsh noted that Ray's decision followed successful re-election campaigns, when the consequences of a political backlash were diminished. Under Ray's leadership, Republicans who controlled the Legislature adopted several laws that would have been less striking coming from a Democratic administration, including substantially increasing how much the state funds public schools and implementing collective bargaining rights for public employees. David Oman, his onetime chief of staff, said Ray sought to win votes from Democrats and independents, not just his Republican base. Oman said campaigns now focus on minimizing the other side and exciting their bases, which he said can lead to wins without a clear mandate. He hopes future campaigns will be successful by returning to Ray's bipartisan approach. \"People tell us anecdotally and by poll that they want clear, differentiated leaders who reach out across party lines and just solve problems,\" Oman said. \"That defines who Bob Ray was.\"",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Sen. Richard Blumenthal that aired Sunday, July 1, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Connecticut Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal. He sits on the Judiciary and the Armed Services Committees. And he joins us this morning from Stamford, Connecticut. Welcome to \"Face the Nation,\" senator. Because you sat on Armed Services I want to give you a chance to respond to what you just heard from Ambassador Bolton, some news there both on North Korea and on Russia. SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: This meeting in Helsinki is deeply alarming. Let's remember that Russia is an enemy and an adversary continuing to attack our nation through cyber and social media, posing a direct threat in the 2018 elections. Donald Trump seems to be the only American in public office who has refused to acknowledge explicitly their attack in 2016, they continue to invade Ukraine, and they support a war criminal in Syria who continues to attack his own people with chemical weapons and the failure to make the Russians pay a price and legitimizing Putin, a KGB thug, with this meeting is very dangerous and the North Korean situation they're now building their nuclear capacity and devising ways to deceive the United States. The concessions we've made in canceling those military exercises with our allies in that region obviously have been met with mockery of those concessions. The same danger exists in the Helsinki meeting with Putin. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator I want to move onto Judiciary and the question of this new Supreme Court nominee. We've yet to hear who it will be. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he wants whoever it is on the job by the beginning of October. That could mean a conservative court for the rest of your lifetime.\u00a0 Is there any nominee that you would vote yes on? SEN. BLUMENTHAL: The president has said that he will appoint someone only if he or she would quote \"automatically overturn Roe v. Wade\" and rollback- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well he now says he won't even ask that question. SEN. BLUMENTHAL: He doesn't need to ask that question because those nominees on his list have already been screened by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation and other outside groups. And he's made it an additional condition that his nominee also commit to rolling back the protections on health insurance, like those for the millions of people who suffer from preexisting conditions. Margaret, I was a law clerk to Justice Harry Blackmun on the United States Supreme Court the year after he wrote the opinion in Roe v. Wade the majority opinion. I've argued cases in the United States Supreme Court. Four of them. I've never seen a court that is so polarized and so politicized. This decision will shape the court for years to come, and it could lead to criminalizing reproductive rights as they were prior to Roe v. Wade. Women were prosecuted and women died and women were denied access to contraception and the morning after pill. And the same with the health insurance protections. These are real lives, real impacts. And, you're absolutely right, the shape of the court will be determined for decades to come. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you regret, sir, your vote back in 2013 to eliminate the filibuster for all federal judicial nominees. I mean that- there was a carve out at the time for Supreme Court. Then Mitch McConnell changed that in 2017. But do you think that was the precedent that has now set the stage- for this vote to happen in the way it will? SEN. BLUMENTHAL: There was really no precedent because that change in rule applied to the lower courts, the courts of appeals and the District Courts. The Supreme Court is very different, and I'm deeply troubled by the prospect of the president of the United States appointing now a justice who will be the swing, crucial vote not only on reproductive rights and workers' rights and civil rights, but also-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think that setting that precedent- you don't regret setting that precedent in 2013? SEN. BLUMENTHAL: I believe that it was the right decision at the time because it enabled us to move forward. But the president should not be permitted to appoint a justice who will decide whether or not he complies with a subpoena to testify before a grand jury, or pardons himself. I believe that whoever is appointed ought to recuse himself and commit to recusing himself from those kinds of decisions that affect the personal finances or the special prosecutor investigation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Immigration is also a hot-button issue - that may and already has in some ways come before the Supreme Court. I want to ask you, sir, do you agree with your colleague Senator Kirsten Gillibrand that we should get rid of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE as that agency is known? SEN. BLUMENTHAL: Abolishing ICE will accomplish nothing unless we change the Trump policies. I visited the border about a week ago. I saw the brutality, and inhumanity, and absolute cruelty of these policies, ripping children away from their parents. There is no plan or path to reunify them. It is not happening and the Trump Administration is embarked on a trainwreck: a moral trainwreck, a legal trainwreck, and a humanitarian trainwreck, because the plan now is to put the families together in tent cities, behind fences and other barbed wire, in ways that amount to imprisonment internment just as was done with people of Japanese descent during World War II. That is a policy that is a disgrace to the United States of America. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal thank you very much for your time. We'll be back in one minute with a lot more FACE THE NATION. So don't go away.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- The national spotlight is on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0after her surprising upset in the 2018 primary for New York's 14th congressional district. Some of the shock may have worn off on Wednesday, but 28-year-old Ocasio-Cortez, like the rest of her party, was still trying to make sense of her come-from-nowhere win. She knocked off the fourth-highest ranking House Democrat, 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley, who had been considered an heir apparent to leader Nancy Pelosi. Crowley may have underestimated his opponent, who until recently was working as a bartender and organizing for Bernie Sanders. \"I wasn't born to a wealthy or powerful family,\" she says in a campaign video that went viral during the campaign. Like Sanders, she considers herself a democratic socialist.  \"The GOP tax cut could have paid for two years of public college for everyone in this country,\" she told CBSN ahead of the election. Democratic leaders carefully parted ways with her on Wednesday on her support for Medicare for all, and the elimination of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Republicans reveled in the upset. They said it showed the socialist wing is building in the Democratic Party. But Pelosi didn't agree. \"It's ascendant in that district, perhaps, but I don't accept any characterization of our party presented by the Republicans,\" Pelosi said. Democrats noted that Crowley is their only House incumbent to lose so far this year, compared to several in the GOP. \u00a0 Some Democrats also said they believe Crowley may have been too focused on party dynamics in D.C. and didn't pay enough attention to his district. Others say it has less to do with politics and more to do with this being the year of the woman, and Ocasio-Cortez just the latest example. Nancy Cordes is CBS News' chief White House correspondent.",

            "article_content": "Mississippi Democrats are choosing between a party stalwart and a newcomer in Tuesday's runoff for the nomination to the U.S. Senate. Either state House minority leader David Baria of Bay St. Louis or venture capitalist Howard Sherman of Meridian will face incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker in November's general election. The Reform Party's Shawn O'Hara of Hattiesburg and Libertarian Danny Bedwell of Columbus are also running in November. Sherman and Baria finished first and second in a six-candidate June 5 primary, with 32 percent and 31 percent of the vote, respectively. Sherman was endorsed by state Rep. Omeria Scott, who finished third. Many other officials, including Mississippi's only Democratic member of Congress, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, back Baria. They question Sherman's Democratic credentials because he donated to Wicker and voted as a Republican in California. Sherman said his donation to Wicker was an effort to prevent a tea party Republican Chris McDaniel from winning office. Baria, a 55-year-old attorney, said he will advocate for education, health care and transportation in Congress, and voiced opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration policies during the runoff. Sherman says he'll bring a business-focused approach to Mississippi's problems, and touts a 100-day plan that includes some private sector efforts. The 63-year-old is married to actress Sela Ward, and together they founded a children's home in Meridian. Sherman had raised $850,000 for the race through June 6, including $650,000 in loans to himself. Baria had raised less than $300,000 Wicker, who has held the Senate seat since late 2007, coasted to a primary victory June 5 over low-budget challenger Richard Boyanton. Either Sherman or Baria would face an uphill climb in conservative Mississippi. John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989, was the last Mississippi Democrat to hold a U.S. Senate seat.",

            "article_content": "Our country is divided between red states and blue states, a division that has intensified since the election of President Donald Trump and some of the blue states are intensifying their resistance to the president. Most prominently, California, the country's bluest and most populous state, led by Governor Jerry Brown. Brown has been governor of California twice - the first time, 40 years ago. He criticizes the president on taxes. California is suing the Trump administration over health care, immigration, and air quality, but nothing raises more righteous passion in Jerry Brown than the issue of climate change. As we first reported last fall, he castigates the president for denying the science and aggravating a problem Governor Brown says is causing California to burn. California suffered its most destructive fire season on record last year. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in December as raging wildfires, whipped by fierce Santa Ana winds and fueled by bone-dry brush, laid waste to tens-of-thousands of acres in Southern California. The smoke plume that shrouded the Los Angeles area could be seen from space. The fires that ravaged California's famed wine country in October were the deadliest the state has ever seen. Whole neighborhoods were incinerated. Dozens of people were killed. Governor Jerry Brown: The fire season used to be a few months in the summer, now it's almost year-long. These fires are unprecedented. We've never seen anything like it. Scientists are telling us, \"This is the kind of stuff that's gonna happen.\" And we gotta deal with it. It's going to happen, he says, based on science that predicts extreme swings in weather patterns. Last year, Southern California experienced record heat in October and November, creating the perfect conditions for this. Governor Jerry Brown: Nature is not a political game. Nature is the ground on which we stand, it's the air which we breathe. The truth of the case is that there's too much carbon being emitted, that heat-trapping gases are building up, the planet is warming and all hell is breaking loose. Bill Whitaker: President Trump has famously called climate change -- a hoax. When he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord he said this wasn't a good deal for the United States.\u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: That's a preposterous idea not even a shred of truth in that statement. So I'd say to Mr. Trump, take a deeper look now is not the time to undo what every country in the world is committed to. Bill Whitaker: Are you fearful? Governor Jerry Brown: Oh yeah, you should, anyone who isn't is not looking at the facts. I don't think President Trump has a fear of the Lord, the fear of the wrath of God, which leads one to more humility. And this is such a reckless disregard for the truth and for the existential consequences that can be unleashed. If he sounds like a Jesuit seminarian, it's because he was one, years ago. Now, he's a climate missionary, traveling the world, preaching the gospel of renewable energy -- at the Vatican; in China, where President Xi Jinping discussed collaborating with California on cutting greenhouse gases. Brown went to the global climate summit in Bonn, Germany last fall. He and former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg led a delegation of mayors and legislators representing 40% of the U.S. economy. While the official U.S. delegation, sent by the White House, showed up to promote coal; Brown went to tell the world President Trump doesn't speak for all Americans. Governor Jerry Brown: California is not waiting for Trump. We're not waiting for all the deniers.\u00a0 He's already weaning California off fossil fuels. To give us a glimpse of the future, Brown took us to a 62-acre solar farm near Sacramento on the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant. Bill Whitaker: You wanna have 50% of California's electricity generated by renewable sources by-- Governor Jerry Brown: By 2030. Bill Whitaker: --2030. And you-- Governor Jerry Brown: And I think-- Bill Whitaker: --think you're gonna beat that? Governor Jerry Brown: Yes, no question about it. With the federal government standing down on climate action, California is blazing its own trail. \u00a0 \u00a0 Bill Whitaker: What can you, the governor of one state in the United States, do to fill in the void? Governor Jerry Brown: As governor of California we have a cap and trade system which is a very efficient way to reducing greenhouse gases. We have zero-emission vehicle mandate. We have efficiency standards for our buildings, for our appliances. So California is showing that dealing with climate is good for the economy, not bad. California is booming. Under Brown, it has grown from the 9th largest economy in the world to the 5th. It's now bigger than the U.K. with a budget surplus of more than $8 billion.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: When you first came into office this time. California faced more than $50 billion in debt and deficits. There were headlines that California was going to be the first \"failed state.\"\u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: The fact is we cut the budget, we raised taxes and the economy roared back.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: You cut the budget. You raised taxes. These days that sounds like a prescription for political suicide? Governor Jerry Brown: You gotta pay some taxes. You have to invest. We need to invest in the technology of tomorrow or somebody else will. And that somebody is China, India and other countries. You're not gonna poor mouth yourself to the future and roads cost money, that's called taxes. R&D cost money, colleges cost money -- schools, childcare, all of that. We're a rich country and we can handle it.\u00a0 But California's economic success has come at a cost. Housing prices are through the roof. So are the ranks of the homeless. A quarter of the country's homeless live in California.\u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: This is not paradise. We have a lot of problems. But California is the engine of America, and I like to remind my fellow citizens when you kinda look askance at this state, you're looking at one of the, not the only one, but a major contributor to the well-being of the whole country.\u00a0 California is vital to the national economy. That's why Brown is so angered by the tax overhaul law that was pushed by House and Senate Republicans. They call it a tax cut, but Brown says by eliminating deductions for state and local taxes it actually increases the tax burden on high tax blue states like California. He and other blue state governors say the bill is retaliation against Trump's opponents. Brown called it evil and divisive.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: Do you think the Republicans are intentionally trying to punish the blue states that didn't vote for President Trump? \u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: I know this. The Republicans have this cult. Just like they believe there's no climate problem, they believe that cutting corporate taxes without any money to pay for it, they think it's magic, it'll make everything wonderful. Very irresponsible. Very dangerous. But California Republicans say Brown's tax hikes are irresponsible. In Trump's America, Jerry Brown's California seems far out on the frontier. California doesn't look like the rest of the country: Minorities are now the majority of the population. It doesn't act like the rest of the country: The state voted to legalize recreational marijuana; It will soon offer a third gender choice on drivers' licenses. Hillary Clinton trounced President Trump here by more than 4 million votes. Bill Whitaker: It seems that California is way out of step with the rest of the country. Governor Jerry Brown: I'd say we're more in tune with the future than many parts of the rest of the country.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: You think the country is going to look more like California in the future? Governor Jerry Brown: I think it will. I was asking myself, \"Why did Democrats in Ohio and Wisconsin and Michigan, Pennsylvania, why'd they vote for Trump?\" Not a lot of 'em did, but enough to give him those states' electoral votes.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: And your answer? Governor Jerry Brown: There's more confidence here; there's less fear. People are looking to the future. They're not scared, they're not going inward, they're not scapegoating, they're not blaming Mexican immigrants. They're not blaming the stranger. Just the opposite. It's is a place that's alive. It's dynamic. It's a culture that's on the move, not pulling up the drawbridge out of fear and and economic insecurity.\u00a0 Jerry Brown is California's 39th and oldest governor. When he first held the office in 1975 he had a full head of hair. His father, Pat Brown had been governor eight years before.\u00a0 When you look at all the staid portraits of his predecessors in the capitol rotunda, it's obvious Jerry Brown is not like the others. Not many politicians spent four years in the seminary as Brown did in the 1950s. Or dated a rock star. He went out with Linda Rondstadt in the 70s. \u00a0\u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: I've seen a lotta different things. I've worked with Mother Theresa. I've spent six months doing Zen meditation in Kamakura, Japan and I've run for President three times. I've done very incompatible things. Bill Whitaker: People who like you will say that that's evidence of intellectual flexibility. People who don't like you say that that's evidence of your being flighty. Governor Jerry Brown: Well, I'm not gonna -- that's that psycho babble. Whatever you call it, his far-out politics his first time in office earned him the moniker Governor Moonbeam. We found him to be down to earth. He's California casual at the office. His dog Colusa has the run of the place. Bill Whitaker: Are you better at being governor this time? Governor Jerry Brown: Yeah, it's a different experience. 79 is not 36. Different ball game in every way. So I would say I know more, I understand more.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: What have you learned about yourself in those intervening years? Governor Jerry Brown: There's something you lose with age, your physical prowess -- but mental acuity and -- just life experience is very important. So, I enjoy the job a lot more. It's hard to see why. His liberal policies make him a punching bag for conservatives and he's not universally loved by liberals. He's a political maverick. He's rolling back state union pensions. He refuses to curb oil production until there's a viable alternative. A majority of Californians like what he's doing. But he's been doing this for almost 50 years and he says it's time to hang up his political spurs. When he leaves office in January 2019, he swears he's going to leave elective politics behind.\u00a0 Bill Whitaker: I think you're gonna miss this.\u00a0 Governor Jerry Brown: No I won't. \u00a0 Bill Whitaker: You don't think so? Governor Jerry Brown: Next year I'll be 80, okay? And what do I want to do with my life? That's my question. Bill Whitaker: What do you want to do? Governor Jerry Brown: Well, I want to spend time with my wife. A go it alone bachelor nearly all of his adult life, Jerry Brown now has a partner to share his life -- Anne Gust Brown, a former executive at The Gap. They married in 2005. \u00a0Their plan is to retire to a ranch, in a golden valley north of Sacramento. They're building their dream ranch house - with solar panels, of course. It's off the grid and way off the beaten path.\u00a0 The governor and Colusa, showed us around. \u00a0 Bill Whitaker: This is beautiful governor. This is pretty steep. Governor Jerry Brown: Oh you haven't seen nothing yet. \u00a0 He told us he's going out at his peak, stepping away from the fray on land his great-grandfather settled in the 1860s. He said he intends to be a modest rancher. He's going to unplug and unwind. \u00a0 Bill Whitaker: Do ya think this man sitting next to you is going to be content puttering around the ranch? Governor Jerry Brown: I wouldn't call it \"puttering.\" I don't \"putter.\" Anne Gust Brown: He sure doesn't putter. No-- Bill Whitaker: Running- - as he said, running a modest ranch. Anne Gust Brown: We both wonder about it. 'Cause we've been running a hundred miles an hour and now we're gonna be in a place that's almost the opposite of that and we'll see. Governor Jerry Brown: Yeah we're on the frontier, as it were. Bill Whitaker: And you're going to like that? Governor Jerry Brown: Well I like being on the frontier. That's for sure.

            "article_content": "MILAN -- Italy's populist, anti-migrant interior minister said Friday that Malta should allow a Dutch-flagged rescue ship carrying hundreds of migrants rescued from rubber dinghies off the Libyan coast to make port there because the ship is now in Maltese waters. \"We ask humanly and politically that Malta finally opens one of its ports and lets these desperate people disembark,\" and then seize the ship, Salvini said. Malta responded that it would \"act according to the laws and applicable conventions,\" without further explanation. International law states that Malta must respond if they are the nearest safe port at rescue or if requested by the ship's captain. The dynamic is similar to the standoff over the Aquarius, operated by French aid groups, which eventually sailed an additional 900 miles last week to deliver 630 migrants to Spain after both Malta and Italy refused to let the rescue ship access their ports. Salvini is making good on an election promise to go after rescue ships run by aid groups, which he has likened to taxi services that help the migrant smugglers. Salvini on Thursday said he would not allow the ship operated by the German NGO Mission Lifeline to enter Italian ports, saying that it had acted improperly by taking on board the 224 migrants that the Italian coast guard had assigned to the Libyan coast guard to rescue. Salvini said the rescue was in Libyan waters, which Lifeline denies. Mission Lifeline said Friday that it still has not been assigned a port, despite its requests. It said it picked up additional migrant passengers during another rescue overnight, and currently was heading north with 234 on board. It said it had responded to a request for help by a merchant vessel to help rescue 113 people. Lifeline referred to reports that as many as 220 people were missing at sea and presumed drowned, according to survivor statements to the U.N. Refugee agency. \"The latest drownings show how important our sea rescue efforts are, and that not a single rescue ship can be missed,\" said Mission Lifeline founder Axel Steier. \"The rescue of human lives must be prioritized before border control.\" More than 640,000 migrants have arrived in Italy since 2014, many of whom made their way northward to join family or to countries perceived as providing more assistance until Italy's neighbors enacted stricter border controls. Arrivals are down some 80 percent this year to around 14,500, as migrants have turned to other routes. How to handle the hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees who have poured into Europe in recent years continues to be \"one of the biggest crises that the European Union has faced in a decade where there have been several crises in a row,\" John Springford, Deputy Director of the Centre for European Reform, told CBS News this week. The EU is a borderless travel zone, meaning once someone enters, he or she is able to move between EU countries freely. This \"freedom of movement\" allows citizens of EU member states to live and work in any EU country they please, but it also means once migrants cross over the bloc's external border, they are relatively free to move anywhere within the Eurozone.",

            "article_content": "Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach unsuccessfully sought a governor's pardon for a corporate campaign donor's vice president whose crime, police said, involved threatening a cab driver by putting a gun to his head. Kobach, a Republican and leading candidate for Kansas governor, approached then-GOP Gov. Sam Brownback's chief counsel about clemency for Kansas City-area resident Ryan Bader in August 2017, state records obtained by The Associated Press show.\u00a0 Kobach was Bader's private attorney and wasn't formally acting in his state role when he initiated the pardon request three years after a state judge expunged the attempted robbery case from Bader's record. Kobach has built a national profile by advocating tough policies against illegal immigration and championing strong voter identification requirements that have put him at the center of multiple lawsuits. He has advised President Donald Trump and was vice chairman of Trump's now disbanded commission on election fraud. Bader is vice president and treasurer of TriStar Arms, his family's Kansas City, Missouri, firearms importing and wholesaling business. It has donated a total of at least $7,000 to Kobach in the past five years, including the maximum $2,000 allowed to Kobach's campaign for governor in December, according to campaign finance records. The company was listed among the sponsors for a Kobach fundraiser in November with Donald Trump Jr. Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer denied Bader's pardon request this week, along with 20 other requests. During a news conference Tuesday in Wichita, Colyer said the governor's pardon power should be used \"sparingly and with great restraint.\" \"We denied the pardon because it involved a violent crime committed with a firearm, and those are not the types of cases in which we typically would consider a pardon.\"Kobach is trying to unseat Colyer in the state's Aug. 7 primary and could grant the pardon himself if he were elected governor in November. He has made fighting what he calls \"the culture of corruption\" in state government a central theme of his campaign. \"We denied the pardon because it involved a violent crime committed with a firearm, and those are not the types of cases in which we typically would consider a pardon,\" Colyer spokesman Kendall Marr said Wednesday. Bader did not return telephone messages left at his office seeking comment, and the attorney who handled his criminal case declined comment. Kobach was in meetings much of Wednesday and did not immediately respond to a request for an interview. But documents providing details about Bader's criminal case and Kobach's advocacy of a pardon for him are contained in a governor's office file obtained by the AP through an open records request. Bader, the attorney in his criminal case, and the prosecutor, all said in documents that Bader expected to have his right to buy a gun restored after his record was expunged, only to learn that he needed a pardon. Bader also said in an undated letter to Brownback that a pardon also would allow him to obtain a federal license to \"carry on my father's company.\" A two-page summary of the case provided by Kobach to the governor's office to initiate the pardon request for Bader, now 35, described his crime as resulting from \"a mistake of judgment in his youth,\" and said he has since been \"a model citizen.\" The judge who expunged his record said in her July 2014 order that it was \"consistent with the public welfare and good.\" Colyer inherited Bader's pardon request from Brownback when Brownback resigned in January to take an ambassador's post, elevating Colyer from lieutenant governor to governor. During Colyer's news conference Tuesday, he said Kansas governors have granted only nine pardons in the past 25 years. \"It should never be done for political purposes,\" Colyer said, without citing any specific case. \"It should never be done for political favors.\" Documents show that Kobach sought to have the pardon granted before Brownback left office. He even provided additional documents two days before Brownback stepped down, saying in an email to Brant Laue, the governor's chief counsel, \"I will keep my cell phone close by.\" According to Kobach's first summary of Bader's case, Bader initially was charged in 2009 with felony aggravated robbery. He was accused of temporarily taking a cellphone from a cab driver who took him to his home in suburban Overland Park, Kansas, after a St. Patrick's Day round of drinking in a Kansas City, Missouri, bar district. Bader later pleaded guilty to the lesser felony charge of attempted robbery. He spent a month in jail and a year on probation, according to his formal application for clemency. \"A gubernatorial pardon would also make clear that the right to keep and bear arms is a sacred one in Kansas,\" Kobach's initial summary said. He is a vocal gun-rights supporter. An affidavit from an Overland Park officer, based on information from other officers, said the cab driver reported that Bader failed to pay his full fare and put a gun to the cab driver's head, threatening to kill him if he called police. The summary provided by Kobach did not mention a gun or an alleged threat, but brief notes from a Dec. 13 telephone conversation between Brownback's office and Kobach said the Kansas secretary of state was \"fully aware\" of the cab driver's report to police. The police affidavit was provided to the governor's office in December by the local district attorney's office, along with a March 2010 pre-sentencing report. In that report, Bader is quoted as saying he had \"no recollection\" of events because he was intoxicated. The cab driver \u2014 whose name is redacted \u2014 said he was so frightened by the incident that he stopped working at night or in downtown Kansas City, making him unable to support his family.",

            "article_content": "President Trump officially directed the Pentagon to establish a sixth branch of the U.S. military in space on Monday. Speaking at a National Space Council meeting at the White House, Mr. Trump called for a \"space force\" to ensure American dominance on the high frontier. The president also signed his administration's third Space Policy Directive, calling for establishment of new protocols and procedures to manage and monitor the increasing numbers of satellites in low-Earth orbit and the tens of thousands of pieces of space junk and debris that pose an increasing threat to costly spacecraft. The directive follows on the heels of two other major space policy initiatives being implemented by the National Space Council, one calling for returning humans to the moon before eventual missions to Mars and another aimed at streamlining the federal space bureaucracy to reduce red tape and streamline licensing and oversight of commercial space activity. In remarks that ranged over a variety of unrelated topics, Mr. Trump began by saying current U.S. employment levels were the best \"in recorded history\" and blaming current immigration problems on the Democrats, saying \"we have the worst immigration laws in the entire world\" and that ongoing issues could be resolved \"very quickly if the Democrats come to the table.\" \"Everybody wants to do it,\" he said. \"We want to do it more than they do. If they come to the table, instead of playing politics, we can do it very, very quickly.\" Turning his attention to space, the president praised the National Space Council and its chairman, Vice President Mike Pence, for its work re-focusing national space policy, saying \"for too many years, our dreams of exploration and discovery were really squandered by politics and bureaucracy. And we knocked that out.\" \"My administration is reclaiming America's heritage as the world's greatest space-faring nation,\" he went on. \"The essence of the American character is to explore new horizons and to tame new frontiers. But our destiny, beyond the Earth, is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national security.\" He said when it comes to defending America, \"it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space.\" \"Very importantly, I'm hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the armed forces. ... We are going to have the Air Force, and we are going to have the Space Force, separate but equal.\" Turning to Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mr. Trump said \"it is going to be something. So important. Gen. Dunford, if you would carry that assignment out, I would be very greatly honored. ... Got it?\" \"We got it,\" Dunford replied. Space is a critical element in U.S. military operations, providing satellite-based intelligence, secure communications, weather forecasting and weapons command and control. Protecting those space-based assets also is critical given the development of anti-satellite weapons by China and Russia. The idea of a space force that would oversee those efforts as a stand-alone Pentagon entity has surfaced several times in the past, but the Pentagon has resisted such calls, leaving it to U.S. Air Force Space Command to oversee such efforts. Mr. Trump provided no details and no timetable, but the establishment of a new branch of the military would be a major undertaking requiring extensive debate and congressional support. The Pentagon's chief spokesperson Dana W. White issued a statement suggesting the process will take some time. \"We understand the President's guidance. Our Policy Board will begin working on this issue, which has implications for intelligence operations for the Air Force, Army, Marines and Navy. Working with Congress, this will be a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders.\" In a letter to lawmakers last year, Defense Secretary James Mattis \"strongly\" urged Congress to reconsider a proposal to establish a separate \"Space Corps,\" saying it was \"premature\" to set up a new organization \"at a time I am trying to reduce overhead.\" \"The creation of an independent Space Corps, with the corresponding institutional growth and budget implications, does not address the specific concerns nor our nation's fiscal problems in a responsive manner,\" The Hill quoted Mattis. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who once flew aboard a space shuttle and who is running for re-election, was quick to object Monday, tweeting his take on Mr. Trump's remarks before the National Space Council meeting even ended. \"The president told a US general to create a new Space Force as 6th branch of military today, which generals tell me they don't want,\" he wrote. \"Thankfully the president can't do it without Congress because now is NOT the time to rip the Air Force apart. Too many important missions at stake.\" The president told a US general to create a new Space Force as 6th branch of military today, which generals tell me they don\u2019t want. Thankfully the president can\u2019t do it without Congress because now is NOT the time to rip the Air Force apart. Too many important missions at stake. https://t.co/uYzqg1W8nE In any case, Mr. Trump signed Space Policy Directive 3 and then left the room, leaving Pence to manage the third public meeting of the National Space Council. Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, reported good progress reducing regulatory overhead and red tape in the commercial space market and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao said her department is making major changes to speed up licensing of commercial launches and landings to encourage private-sector development of low-Earth orbit, including space tourism. Jim Bridenstine, NASA's new administrator, told the council the civilian space agency is working to implement Space Policy Directive 1, which calls for astronauts to return to the moon as the nation's next major space objective. NASA is developing concepts for an orbital \"gateway\" space station circling the moon that would serve as a base of operations, a technology testbed and a jumping off point for future flights into deep space. \"The goal is sustainability,\" Bridenstine said. \"We do not want this to be 'Lucy and the football' again. When we go to the moon, we're going, as the president said in his speech, this time we're going to stay. The gateway gives us that great opportunity. \"It's also important to note that as NASA develops these capabilities, each one of these capabilities feeds forward. The reason we go to the moon is we want to land Americans on the surface of Mars. The technologies, the capabilities, the in situ resource utilization that we develop for the moon will ultimately get us to Mars.\" The council then heard from two panels of experts who all agreed with the current plan to send astronauts back to the moon as the immediate goal of America's human space program. But Terry Virts, a veteran shuttle astronaut and space station crew member, argued against building a gateway similar in concept to NASA's current space station. \"It essentially calls for building another orbital space station, a skill my colleagues and I have already demonstrated on the ISS,\" Virts said. \"Gateway will only slow us down, taking time and precious dollars away from the goal of returning to the lunar surface and eventually flying to Mars.\" \"Most importantly,\" he added, \"any future exploration plan must be bipartisan. Unless these efforts are truly bipartisan, from the beginning, they will be doomed to eventual cancellation. You see, getting back to the moon and eventually to Mars does not depend on rocket science. It depends on political science.\" Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News.

            "article_content": "The results of President Trump's historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un face deep skepticism from lawmakers in both parties \u2013 but the skepticism may ultimately run deepest among a crop of Democrats preparing for possible 2020 presidential campaigns. Mr. Trump\u00a0returned from the historic Singapore summit Wednesday morning\u00a0and was greeted by lingering queries from both sides of the aisle. Traveling in China, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also clashed with reporters who pressed him for details on how the United States will verify that North Korea is relinquishing its nuclear arsenal. On the sidelines of a different kind of summit in Washington -- a gathering of liberal organizations -- Democratic senators seeking to curry favor with party activists expressed reservations about the nuclear agreement. There is \"no evidence North Korea has given up anything,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. She added that North Korea has a long history of broken promises and is known to \"make promises to make more promises.\" \"It's unfortunately a lot of sizzle, but no steak,\" added Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. \"And more than that, I worry that he's given up a lot now.\" Booker said he was concerned about\u00a0Mr. Trump's praise for Kim in a Fox News\u00a0interview that aired Tuesday night, where the president praised the dictator as a \"strong guy\" and a \"great negotiator.\" \"Maybe he was a great negotiator because he got us to commit to stop exercises,\" Booker noted with a tinge of irony. The limited information shared with lawmakers is troubling, Booker added. \"I haven't seen anything yet but a press release,\" Booker said. He called the new reality of American diplomatic affairs \"stunning\" and \"troubling.\" Shaking his head, Booker added, \"I wouldn't believe it if someone wrote a fiction novel about this. We have a president that seems to want a better relationship with the leader of North Korea than the Canadian Prime Minister.\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, another member of the Armed Services panel, said she's eager for more details on Mr. Trump's vow to end military exercises with South Korea. \"This is the very issue that we probably should have had hearings on, had discussions about, fully understood what it would mean to give this up in exchange for denuclearization of North Korea,\" she said. A lack of foreign policy experience or military service is often a detriment for candidates challenging a sitting president, which is why several savvy Democrats plotting White House campaigns have spent years eagerly seeking seats on military and foreign policy committees. The positions give them an opportunity to travel the world to meet with foreign leaders, drop into war zones, tour military bases, and to grill top administration officials in televised hearings.\u00a0 Plus, the perch makes them a go-to guest on television news programs \u2013 especially when global conflicts arise. Gillibrand joined the Armed Services panel in 2011 \u2013 taking a spot once occupied by her Senate predecessor, Hillary Clinton. Warren joined the committee last year \u2013 a move clearly designed to bolster the former law professor's thin foreign policy and military portfolio and a committee workload that focused on aging, banking, energy and health issues. Booker joined the Foreign Relations Committee in 2017 and earned a slot on the Judiciary Committee earlier this year \u2013 alongside Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, another presidential aspirant. Harris started her Senate career last year with a seat on the Intelligence Committee \u2013 a usually secretive body that has emerged as one of the more consequential groups on Capitol Hill given its investigations into Russian meddling in U.S. elections. Booker, Harris, Gillibrand and Warren all headlined the \"We the People\" summit on Wednesday, alongside Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, who are also known to be preparing for potential 2020 presidential bids. On stage, the Democrats focused almost exclusively on domestic policy, emphasizing their support for labor unions, higher minimum wage rates, and Mr. Trump's divisive rhetoric aimed at minorities. The first-of-its-kind gathering put the senators in front of leaders and rank-and-file members from Communication Workers of America, Demos Action, Indivisible, MoveOn, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and Working Families Party, among other groups. After remarks from each lawmaker, audience members asked often long-winded questions to put the speaker on the record as embracing liberal positions on issues ranging from immigration reform to Wall Street regulations. Off-stage, despite their concerns with what Mr. Trump might have guaranteed Kim, the senators agreed that the meeting was a welcome alternative to military action or\u00a0brash tweets. \"This is better than what I was seeing before, which was two world leaders behaving as they were bullies on the playground, talking about the size of their buttons and things like that,\" Booker said. Gillibrand agreed, saying, \"I will support his efforts because diplomacy is the right solution, not military action. And I'm going to support his efforts as long as he's not trying to do that.\" As for next steps, Warren asserted that the ball was in the president's court. \"We'll keep pushing the President, but he's the lead negotiator.\" CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

            "article_content": "President Trump touted the importance of midterm victories, speaking to the abortion-opposing Susan B. Anthony List's 11th Annual Campaign for Life Gala Tuesday night in Washington, D.C. The president's remarks come shortly after his administration announced it intends to pull federal funding from health facilities that make referrals to abortion clinics. \u00a0 Mr. Trump emphasized that Democrats in the House and Senate don't share their conservative values on the right to life, using that as a basis for the need to elect more Republicans. The president said the GOP needs nine more votes in the Senate to garner enough support for a 20-week abortion ban. But he also touted his 2016 victory more than once, as he often does when addressing a friendly audience. \"Your vote in 2018 is every bit important as your vote in 2016, although I'm not sure I really believe that, but you know. I don't know who the hell wrote that line,\" Mr. Trump said. Despite that off-script remark, the president still spent much of his speech highlighting the need to elect more Republicans and conservatives in the House and Senate. \"We must work together to elect more lawmakers who share our values,\" he said, to an audience that seemed to support his agenda on tax cuts, immigration, and other key administration agenda items, in addition to his agenda on abortion.\u00a0 The federal funding rule change is being cheered by many conservatives, as it will pull funding from groups like Planned Parenthood. The move, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said last week, \"would ensure that taxpayers do not indirectly fund abortions.\" Critics of the administration say the change could seriously restrict funding for essential women's health services. Mr. Trump highlighted that and other administrative changes to restrict federal funding for abortion. \"My administration has proposed a new rule to prohibit Title X funding from going to any clinic that performs abortions,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday night, to applause from his audience.\u00a0 The Susan B. Anthony List raises funds for federal candidates who oppose legal abortion. Vice President Mike Pence spoke to the group last year. But the SBA List hasn't always supported Mr. Trump. Before he was nominated, the group urged voters to look elsewhere within the GOP for its 2016 champion, and called Mr. Trump \"unacceptable.\" But since then, Mr. Trump has championed their causes.\u00a0 On Tuesday night, the group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said the upcoming midterm elections are important, calling this a good opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision determining abortion is legal.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "U.S. Senate candidate Mitt Romney defended himself at a debate Tuesday from attacks on his status as recent Utah transplant who has previously criticized President Donald Trump. Romney parried the criticism from his opponent, state Rep. Mike Kennedy, and praised the president's handling of several issues including China on trade. Mr. Trump has endorsed Romney, which the former governor of Massachusetts said shows the president \"respects people who call them like they see them.\" Kennedy blasted Romney for comments made during the 2016 presidential election in which he called Trump a \"fraud.\" \"If I disagree with the president, I will do so in respectful fashion,\" Kennedy said. Kennedy said Romney doesn't work well with others and cited a recent tweet in which Romney called a pastor a \"religious bigot.\" Romney defended his statement saying a Dallas pastor who called Mormonism and Islam \"heresy from the pit of Hell,\" was the wrong choice to give the opening prayer at opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. \"When people express bigotry they ought to be called out for it,\" Romney said. Romney is favored to win in Utah, where Trump's brash style doesn't always go over well. But Kennedy, a conservative doctor and lawyer, made it a contest when he won the favor of hard-right-leaning state GOP stalwarts. Both men largely praised the president's handling of issues such as North Korea and immigration and expressed dismay about the deficit. The national debt has been Kennedy's marquee issue, and he said he'd vote against any omnibus spending bills. Romney agreed, and said he'd bring together a group of senators he knows ahead of time to say they won't vote on such spending bills. The plan is in line with Romney's pitch that his high political profile would bring Utah more clout in Washington than the average freshman senator. During Tuesday's debate, which was the last scheduled before the June 26 primary, the two candidates differed on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic ones. Romney said he supports a ban while Kennedy says such measures don't work and said he wants to focus preventing shootings through things such as mental health treatment. The two are vying to win the Republican primary in the race to replace Sen. Orrin Hatch, who is retiring after 40 years. Kennedy says he's a homegrown, conservative alternative to Romney, whom he painted as an outsider whose positions have flip-flopped over the years. Romney moved to the state after his failed 2012 presidential run. While Kennedy is an attractive candidate for anti-Romney Trump supporters, he'll have to gain support from a wider slice of the electorate to make his mark in Utah, where the president's brash style doesn't always go over well. Romney is a beloved adopted son in Utah, where he's known for his role in turning around the 2002 Winter Olympics and becoming the first Mormon presidential nominee of a major political party. The former governor of Massachusetts moved to Utah after his 2012 presidential loss, and made a speech there calling Trump \"phony\" and a \"fraud\" during the 2016 campaign. The two have largely buried the hatchet, though some tensions remain. The winner of the Republican primary will face Democrat Jenny Wilson. But GOP candidates have a big upper hand in conservative Utah. Kennedy has served as a representative in Utah's Legislature since 2013. He got attention this year for heading up a commission to improve school safety in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida.",

            "article_content": "The summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might be back on, with Mr. Trump telling reporters Saturday night that meetings to revive the scrapped summit are ongoing. South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Kim in a surprise meeting Saturday, and said Kim remains committed to a meeting with Mr. Trump. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, joined us to discuss whether the summit should go forward, trade relations with China, immigration and the release of American Joshua Holt from a Venezuelan prison. The following is a transcript of the interview with Rubio airing Sunday, May 27, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us from Miami this morning is Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio. Good Memorial Day weekend to you, senator. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump says it looks good for that June 12th summit with Kim Jong Un. Should it go ahead? SENATOR RUBIO: It depends. It depends what's going to happen there. You know North Korea is a strange place. We're not dealing with Italy or France here or some-- even the old Soviet Union. So they're playing a game you know Kim Jong Un these nuclear weapons or something he's psychologically attached to, they are what give him his prestige and importance. I mean we're not talking about him because of his global and economic power. We're talking about them because they have nuclear weapons and long range missiles and he knows that. And so for him to give that up is going to be very difficult. So my suspicion remains that he is going to try to get as much sanctions relief as possible without having to give up his weapons. And I think it's going to be a lot of twists and turns along the way to to try to get there if it's even possible. But I hope I'm wrong. I'd love to see them denuclearize. I just I'm not very optimistic about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been vocal about what you think is China outmaneuvering the U.S. on trade on North Korea as well you've raised your concerns. But specifically I want to ask you about this deal with Chinese telecom company-- SENATOR RUBIO: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: -- ZTE. You've been leading the charge against it. President Trump says he's got a deal in place to help save this company that's been accused of being a national security threat to the United States. Why isn't the White House proposal sufficient to meet your concerns? SENATOR RUBIO: So, I talked to the president for over half an hour on Friday night and I think I've gotten to the crux of the difference between his administration and myself and others on our view on this. I think for the president, he's viewing the ZTE issue as a company that broke sanctions and he wants to impose sanctions on them and penalties that are stronger than anyone that has ever seen before and he's right-- MARGARET BRENNAN: One-point-three billion dollar fine he says. SENATOR RUBIO: Correct. \u00a0And if this was just a company that did something wrong and needed to be punished, the president's right. The difference is I don't view this just as a ZTE issue. I view it in the broader context of China that has-- that is trying to overtake the United States. They do it by debowing our intel-- our intellectual property. They steal all of our stuff as I said. And then there has to be consequences for that. And the only thing China is going to respond to is consequential actions over a sustained period of time and putting a company like ZTE out of business is the kind of consequential action that Russia will find that China will finally see that we are taking this stuff seriously and that's the difference of opinion. I don't just view the ZTE issue through ZTE alone. I view it in the broader context of what China is trying to do overtake the United States by stealing and by cheating and they're not going to stop until they know there are real consequences for doing it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what does that mean. It sounds like this is a done deal. Can Congress do anything to block the transition? SENATOR RUBIO: Well first of all one of the things that Congress will do is not only put-- not even allow Chinese telecom companies to operate in the United States. It's not just ZTE, it's Huawei, all of them depend on the U.S. semiconductors. None of these companies should be operating in this country. None of them. They are used for espionage. They are part of the supply chain whether it's routers or anything else they embed stuff in there that could be used to spy against us not just for national security. That's how they steal corporate secrets. That's how they transfer technology. If they can't force you to do it through a business deal, they steal it from you. And all of a sudden they can do what we can do but they didn't spend any money to innovate it and then they can surpass us. And we're not going to let that happen through theft. We shouldn't and that's why we shouldn't have any Chinese telecom companies operating in the US. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president going to sign that bill you propose? SENATOR RUBIO: Well, I believe it'll have a supermajority. I think most members of Congress have come to understand the threat China poses.. But this is a good start and I think there's a growing commitment in Congress to do something about what China is trying to do to the United States. And this is a good place to start, as I said, and I think we'll have a super majority to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, you have the president's ear on Venezuela policy. We know overnight you saw the release of this American after being held for two years in a Venezuelan prison. It was a positive moment in what has been a really difficult week between our two countries. Is there an opportunity here? SENATOR RUBIO: Well, first of all I'm glad that Josh Holt is home. He didn't have anything to do with politics. He was a Mormon missionary who went down there to meet up with his wife and bring her back to the United States at some point. And they took him as a hostage for over two years. Last week they were saying he was the head of the CIA efforts. So it's ridiculous and I'm glad he's home. This has nothing to do with the broader issue of sanctions however those things stay in place the administration made that clear policy has not changed. Is there an opportunity? Yeah. Here's the opportunity. That Venezuela returns to constitutional order. They have an elected national assembly, they have a constitutionally appointed Supreme Court. Both of those entities are not allowed to operate by the dictatorship. Those need to be-- we need to recognize them. Those things need to be put back in place. There needs to be free and fair and internationally supervised elections. Our sanctions are built on that. And when that happens the sanctions go away. Until that happens the sanctions remain and it will actually increase. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, the President tweeted yesterday that he thinks it is a quote unquote horrible law to separate illegal immigrants from their children when they cross the border into the U.S. Do you agree it's a horrible law? SENATOR RUBIO: To separate. I'm sorry? The illegal people-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Illegal parents from their children to transfer custody when they cross illegally. SENATOR RUBIO: Well ultimately when somebody-- a couple of things need to happen. Number one is we have a problem and it needs to be dealt with. The ideal scenario is that families be kept together and returned expeditiously back to their country of origin. We sympathize with people that are coming here. America is the most generous country in the world and ideally you wouldn't put people through additional trauma once they came into the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you try to change that law? SENATOR RUBIO: Well I would be open to changing that law but the better law to change is to secure our border and to send a clear message that you cannot continue to enter the United States illegally. It is actually inhumane not to secure our border because we are sending out a message that is encouraging people to come here we have to understand a lot of these people that are crossing children are being trafficked here. They are being brought here by criminal groups that help guide them and often take advantage of them and brutalize them on the path towards the United States and the ability to cross that border is a magnet that is drawing this behavior. MARGARET BRENNAN: You sit on Senate Intelligence, senator, the president insists that there was an FBI spy in his campaign. Ultimately, is it the job of the campaign to police its own staff? And did you see any evidence here that there was a quote unquote spy or informant embedded? SENATOR RUBIO: So let me say this very clearly if there was someone in that campaign, the FBI or any government agency, there to spy on the campaign-- on the campaign-- we want to know about that and that person should be prosecuted and those efforts should be revealed. On the other hand... MARGARET BRENNAN: But no evidence so far of that? SENATOR RUBIO: Well, I haven't seen any yet but maybe there is, and if it's there, we'll find it and we want to know about it. The flip side of it is-- if there are people operating in this country trying to influence American politics on behalf of a foreign power, it is the FBI's job to investigate those people. What I have seen so far is an FBI effort to learn more about individuals with a history of bragging about links to Russia that pre-exist the campaign. If those people were operating near my office or my campaign, I'd want them investigated and I'd want to know about them. That's what I've seen so far. If it turns out to be something different, we want to know about it. But it is the FBI's job to investigate counterintelligence and that there are people out there with a known history of potential links to a foreign power and they are operating in the orbit of any political campaign or any political office, it is the FBI's job to look at them and find out what they're up to, and so far that appears to be what happened. If something different happened, we all want to know about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Rubio, thank you. SENATOR RUBIO: Thank you.",

Asked if the investigation casts a \"cloud\" over the White House, Kelly told National Public Radio in a rare interview that aired Thursday night the probe \"may not be a cloud\" over the White House, but it does get discussed.\u00a0 \"It may not be a cloud but certainly the president is, you know, somewhat embarrassed, frankly,\" Kelly said. \"When world leaders come in, it's kind of like, you know, Bibi Netanyahu is here ... who's under investigation himself, and it's like, you know, you walk in, and you know, the first couple of minutes of every conversation might revolve around that kind of thing.\" Asked about that comment after an event at the White House Rose Garden Friday, Mr. Trump said \"distracted\" would be a better descriptor than \"embarrassed.\" Kelly also talked about the Trump administration's efforts to fight illegal immigration. He says most people coming into the country illegally \"are not bad people,\" but says they won't assimilate easily, calling them \"overwhelmingly rural people.\" Kelly, also told NPR that, despite \"times of great frustration,\" he doesn't regret leaving his former post as secretary of homeland security and joining the White House. Kelly, asked if he ever seriously considered leaving his post, said simply, \"No.\" \"In retrospect, I wish I had been here from day one,\" Kelly said. \"I think in some cases in terms of staffing or serving the president that first six months was pretty chaotic and there were people some people hired that maybe shouldn't have.\" The possibility of Kelly's departure has been floated for months, particularly after the saga involving former White House aide Rob Porter, who was accused of abusing his ex-wives. But Kelly is still there. Kelly told NPR he speaks his opinion on everything \u2014 even when the president doesn't listen. \"My view is to speak truth to power. I always give my opinion on everything. He always listens,\" he said. \"Sometimes he takes the opinion, sometimes he doesn't.\"",

            "article_content": "Our SUNDAY PROFILE this morning is of Nikki Haley, our outspoken Ambassador to the United Nations.  She talks with Rita Braver:\u00a0 If this administration has a star, it just might be Nikki Haley. From her first day on the job as United Nations Ambassador, the 46-year old laid down the law. \u00a0\"For those who don't have our back, we're taking names,\" she said in January 2017. And as she took Braver on a visit to the floor of the United Nations Security Council, she defended her tough stance.  Braver said, \"Some people say there's a little too much swagger, you know that.\" \"You know, I don't think it's swagger. I think it's passion.\u00a0 I am very passionate about defending the United States.\" After a gas attack in Syria, she held up pictures of injured children, blaming Russian-backed forces. \"How many more children have to die before Russia cares?\" she said. And late last year, she pushed through tough international sanctions against North Korea after they tested an intercontinental ballistic missile \u2013 sanctions that may have helped lead to recent promises to roll back North Korea's nuclear program, and to an upcoming summit.  \"A few months ago, it almost seemed like this administration was prepared for war with North Korea. Were you prepared for that?\" asked Braver.  \"I think this administration was creating the tone with North Korea to remind them exactly what could happen to them if they threaten the United States,\" Haley replied. \"No one wants war. The president doesn't want war. I don't want war. No one wants war.\u00a0  But it is an option.\" When you spend some time with Haley, you notice how often she brings President Trump into the conversation. She is unfailingly loyal to him, constantly stressing his accomplishments.  Braver asked, \"What do you say to people who say, 'Okay, maybe he's done some things right, but his behavior is sometimes reprehensible?' Do you ever think that?\" \"First of all, he has his communication style, but you're not hearing me defend that,\" Haley said. \"What I will tell you is, if there is anything that he communicates in a way that I'm uncomfortable with, I pick up the phone and call him. I don't need to be public about that. I think that's a private conversation that should happen when I feel it, and I think it's one that he's receptive to when I do.\" One place where Haley is in lockstep with President Trump is on his charges that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election has gone on too long.  Braver asked Haley, \"Should the president shut it down?\" \"No, not at all \u2013 I mean, anything that comes like this, it should play its part. It should go through the process.\u00a0 But they need to do it quickly.\u00a0 For the good of the country this investigation needs to happen quickly.\" Haley does sometimes put a softer focus on the president's pronouncements.\u00a0 Earlier this year, Mr. Trump threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that don't do more to stop drug trafficking. \"They're laughing at us, so I'm not a believer in that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I want to stop the aid.\" A few weeks later, Braver traveled to Honduras with Haley as she conferred with senior officials; witnessed a drug enforcement exercise; and also made time to visit a U.S.-funded afterschool program.  Haley said, \"If they get education and they get training, then we know that they're going to be productive. If they don't, we'll be dealing with resentful children that are uneducated and angry, and that's what we don't want.\"  \"You sound like a liberal,\" said Braver.  \"I'm not a liberal, I assure you. I am a conservative who understands prevention saves us a lot more money in the long run.\" In fact, Haley is a Tea Party conservative \u2013   against Obamacare, anti-abortion, and tough on illegal immigration, as the daughter of Sikh immigrants from India who came to the U.S. legally and settled in the small town of Bamberg, South Carolina.  Growing up, Haley said, her family as always the \"other.\" \"Your father wears a turban, your mother wears a sari. We looked different, everybody treated us different. But it was in that small town that I'm very grateful, because my parents reminded us that it's not about how you are different, it's about how you're similar.\" After Clemson University, Nikki Randawa (as she was known) married Michael Haley, now a National Guard Officer.\u00a0 They have two children.\u00a0 She was an accountant, working in her family's gift and clothing business when, in 2004, she decided to run for the state legislature. \"You took on the longest-serving member of the state legislature, a man who as I recall referred to you as 'little lady,' and you won,\" said Braver.  \"You know, ignorance is bliss!\" Haley laughed. \"All I knew was, there were too many lawyers at the statehouse, and they needed an accountant. And I needed to figure out how to get there.\" In 2010 she beat the odds again by winning the Governor's race. But it was a dirty campaign, with both racism and sexual innuendo that would surface again this year.  Braver said, \"In that campaign, you had two people falsely say that they have had extramarital affairs with you. Just recently we had somebody who was very much slapped down trying to insinuate that there was something with you and the president. Is that just the price you pay for being a young, attractive woman in politics?\" Haley replied, \"What I've noticed is, if a woman does well, if a woman's good at her job, for some reason people have trouble giving her that credit for just being good at her job. What I will tell you is, I will stand up every time it happens and let people know it is not okay.\" As South Carolina Governor, Haley gained national prominence after she pushed through a bill to remove the Confederate flag from the State Capitol grounds in the wake of a racially-motivated shooting that killed nine people in a black church. She said, \"That flag, while an integral part of our past, does not represent the future of our great state.\" She was handily re-elected, but left to join the Trump Administration, where she's shown it's a mistake to mess with Nikki Haley.\u00a0  Last month on \"Face the Nation,\" in response to the latest gas attack in Syria (believed carried out by Russian-backed forces), she announced:  \"You will see that Russian sanctions will be coming down. Secretary Mnuchin will be announcing those on Monday if he hasn't already and they will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons use. And so I think everyone is going to feel it at this point. We wanted their friends Iran and Russia to know that we meant business and that they were going to be feeling the pain from this as well.\"\u00a0 But at the last minute, the White House decided to hold off.\u00a0 The president's new economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, then came out and said that Haley had had some \"momentary confusion\" in announcing new sanctions. She fired back in a public statement that said, \"With all due respect, I don't get confused.\" \"That was a pretty strong statement,\" Braver asked. \"Why'd you feel like you wanted to say that?\"\u00a0  \"That's just how I function. If there's something wrong, you go and you make it right. But I think what's more important is the fact that Larry's a friend of mine. He immediately called, he immediately apologized.\" That combination of silk and steel has cut through to the public. A new Quinnipiac University poll found her approval rating much higher than that of the President (63% to 39%). She even scores 55% among Democrats \u2026 which has led to inescapable speculation: About running for president, Haley says, \"I don't think about it. No one wants to believe this. But people spend more time talking about my future. My job is to be the best U.N. Ambassador I can possibly be and make sure that people are proud of it. I don't think about the future, and honestly, I don't have time. Between North Korea, Russia and Syria, the last thing I'm thinking about is what I'm gonna do in the future.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For more info: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Story produced by Gabriel Falcon.",

            "article_content": "Well, it's complicated.  Last month, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that Mr. Trump \"certainly believes\" he has the power to fire Mueller. \"We've been advised that the president certainly has the power to make that decision,\" she told reporters.  Sanders' statement prompted a certain amount of head scratching in Washington, since it was generally understood that only Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could fire Mueller after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the case, and then, only for \"good cause.\" Supreme Court decisions going back to 1839 would also indicate that government employees can only be fired by the person who appointed them.\u00a0 So Mr. Trump could order Rosenstein to fire Mueller, but Rosenstein could resign instead of doing it. Mr. Trump could then keep firing Rosenstein's successors until he found someone willing to dismiss Mueller, which is essentially what President Nixon did in his \"Saturday Night Massacre\" of 1973. The move backfired on Nixon and set in motion a chain of events that culminated in his resignation, which partly explains why Republican senators had seemed confident that Mr. Trump won't try to remove Mueller. But what Sanders said was that Mr. Trump could just go around Rosenstein and fire Mueller directly.  Meanwhile, the president is once again registering his disapproval of Mueller's investigation, once again calling it a \"witch hunt\" in a series of tweets Tuesday morning. Mueller has provided Mr. Trump's legal team with a list of nearly four dozen questions for the president. The questions were then leaked to the press, prompting Mr. Trump's Tuesday tweet storm.\u00a0 So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were \u201cleaked\u201d to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice! This is where it gets tricky, because there's some debate among legal scholars on the issue. The most legally safe way for the president to fire the special counsel is to order Rosenstein and, if need be, his successors to do it. Still, it's something of an open question as to whether Mr. Trump can sidestep that process and just fire Mueller himself.  If the president decided he wanted to fire Mueller, one thing he could theoretically do is rescind the regulation that governs the special counsel's appointment. But Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general who helped write the current regulation, said on Twitter that Mr. Trump doesn't have the power to rescind it.\u00a0 5.I do not think Trump can directly remove the regs, since they were made by DOJ under laws of Congress that so authorized DOJ, and thus the regs have to be removed by DOJ.  Congress gave this power to DOJ, and DOJ exercised it in 1999. Scott L. Fredericksen, a former federal prosecutor, agrees that Mr. Trump doesn't have the authority. \"I think that would be unwise, if only because he's going to expose himself to inevitable litigation challenging his power to unilaterally rescind the regulation,\" Frederickson told CBS News.\u00a0 Alternatively, Mr. Trump could argue that he's not bound by the Justice Department regulation protecting Mueller. Or he could argue that, because Rosenstein technically invoked a different statute in appointing Mueller, the regulation doesn't apply to the special counsel. For his part, Rosenstein has said the regulation does apply to Mueller, meaning only he can fire the special counsel, and only for good reason. In theory, however, the president could disagree and insist that he can fire Mueller directly. \"I agree that the proper and most legally sound route would be to order Rosenstein to dismiss Mueller and then fire him if he doesn't comply,\" Jack L. Goldsmith, who led the Office of Legal Counsel under President George W. Bush, told the New York Times.  \"That is clearly the right way under the law. That is the right way under the precedents. And that would be the legally safer way to do it. But there is an argument that he could do so directly and that question has never been tested in a context exactly like this.\" Experts disagree on the issue, in part because it's never been done or really even contemplated much until recently.\u00a0 \"We're in somewhat uncharted territory...one can certainly fashion that argument that the president has complete power in the executive branch and can do whatever he darn well pleases,\" Fredericksen said. \"I think the better argument, though, is that he is bound by the regulation in place governing the appointment of Mr. Mueller, that he doesn't have unfettered discretion to do whatever he wants. But there is disagreement over that.\" In a recent blog post, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Marty Lederman, who served in the Obama administration,\u00a0argued at length that Mr. Trump does not have the power to fire Mueller directly.\u00a0 \"I'd be\u00a0very\u00a0surprised if [Mr. Trump] purports to remove Mueller,\" Lederman wrote. \"And if he does so, Mueller surely knows that [Mr. Trump] lacks such authority. Therefore, he might well respond as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton did when President Andrew Johnson purported to remove him in violation of a statutory restriction\u2013namely, refuse to leave his office and continue performing his functions.\" Another idea that's been floated is that Mr. Trump could use the Federal Vacancies Act of 1998 to fire Rosenstein and replace him with someone willing to fire Mueller. According to that law, in the event of a vacancy, the president can appoint someone who's already been confirmed by the Senate, such as a loyal cabinet member, as a temporary replacement.  However, it's unclear if it would be applicable in situations where the president has created the vacancy by firing someone. And if Mr. Trump is dead set on finding someone willing to carry out an order to fire Mueller, someone like that might appear somewhere down the Justice Department's line of succession. Nixon, for example, had to fire both his attorney general and his deputy attorney general before finding someone willing to fire the Watergate special prosecutor, which turned out to be then-Solicitor General Robert Bork.  In any case, if Mueller were to be terminated, the investigation would continue under the auspices of the FBI. So even if Mueller goes, the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election would continue.\u00a0 When Sanders suggested Mr. Trump did have the right to fire Mueller,\u00a0 Republican Sens. Thom Tillis and Lindsey Graham teamed up with Democratic Sens. Chris Coons and Cory Booker to\u00a0introduce legislation aimed at protecting Mueller. The legislation would allow Mueller to seek an expedited judicial review of his firing. The review would then determine whether he was fired for good cause. Last week, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the Senate would not be voting on the bill, although Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, allowed his committee to vote on the legislation anyway. The bill was advanced by the committee last week.\u00a0 \u00a0Lawmakers have also been privately and publicly warning Mr. Trump not to fire Mueller. \"It would be suicide for the president to want to talk about firing Mueller,\" Grassley recently told Fox Business Network. \"The less the president said on this whole thing, the better off he would be, the stronger his presidency would be.\"\u00a0 And last month, conservative pundit Erick Erickson published a profanity-laced screed by an anonymous Republican congressman who, at one point, said that firing Mueller could lead to Mr. Trump's impeachment.\u00a0 \"Judiciary is stacked with a bunch of people who can win re-election so long as they don't p*** off Trump voters in the primary,\" the unidentified lawmaker said. \"But if we get to summer and most of the primaries are over, they just might pull the trigger if the president fires Mueller. The s** will hit the fan if that happens and I'd vote to impeach him myself. Most of us would, I think. Hell, all the Democrats would and you only need a majority in the House.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "At the state Republican convention in Utah on Saturday, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney came in second place for the Senate seat to a little-known local politican, Michael Kennedy. The two will face off in a primary on June 26, but Salt Lake Tribune senior\u00a0managing editor Matt Canham told CBSN's \"Red & Blue\" that the former Massachusetts governor is \"probably not too worried.\" \"I think the governor was prepared for this but the average primary Republican voter in Utah is a step to the middle from the convention and is probably well-known and more well financed candidate like Mitt Romney,\" Canham said.\u00a0 Utah's \"unique\" way of selection party candidates means there are two ways to get on the ballot. According to UtahPolicy.com, one option is to get the support of 60 percent of the 4,000 state convention delegations. A candidate can also guarantee a spot on the ballot by gathering enough signatures of supporters, which Romney did. In this case, there would be a primary anyway because Romney received 49 percent of the vote at the convention to Kennedy's 51 percent.\u00a0 As Canham noted, the delegates are the \"far-right\" of the Republican party, and Romney is \"not the far-right's best, most-liked candidate.\"\u00a0 Kennedy, a doctor and state legislator from a more conservative part of the state, \u00a0\"knows he's an underdog,\" Canham said.\u00a0 \"He's not going to have the money, he definitely doesn't have the name ID,\" Canham said. \"But this is his chance to really show he is a force in Utah politics, even if he doesn't win this race, it could set him up in the future ... . I think for him, it's the idea of being a principled conservative who can match Mitt Romney and go toe-to-toe. I guess you never know, but he knows he's the underdog in this primary.\" Canham said the major issues in the race mirror many national issues: Immigration, financial security and health care. But there's also another big factor: President Trump, which Canham calls a \"complicated issue\" for Romney. During the 2016 campaign, Romney called Mr. Trump a \"phony\" and a \"fraud,\" and then publicly said he would consider being nominated to be Secretary of State. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, endorsed Romney already. \"Mitt Romney gets asked about it where ever he goes because it is a little bit complicated,\" Canham said. \"To have the president endorse him \u2013 it's a tense relationship between these two men and it will be something that stays over this race between now and the primary in June and the general election in November.\"",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0- When President Donald Trump made a congratulatory phone call to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, White House chief of staff John Kelly wasn't on the line. When Mr. Trump tapped John Bolton to be his next national security adviser, Kelly wasn't in the room. And when Mr. Trump spent a Mar-a-Lago weekend stewing over immigration and trade, Kelly wasn't in sight. Kelly, once empowered to bring order to a turbulent West Wing, has receded from view, his clout diminished, his word less trusted by staff and his guidance less tolerated by an increasingly go-it-alone president. Emboldened in his job, Mr. Trump has rebelled against Kelly's restrictions and mused about doing away with the chief of staff post entirely. It's all leading White House staffers and Trump allies to believe that Kelly is working on borrowed time. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has governed at breakneck pace, ousting aides and issuing surprise policy announcements on Twitter, recreating the helter-skelter feel of his first months in office. Kelly's allies maintain that his retreat is strategic. They suggest that the belief that Kelly was Mr. Trump's savior was an overstated idea all along and that the chief of staff is now content to loosen the reins and allow an increasingly comfortable president to govern from his gut. But those close to the president say that Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed fatigue at Kelly's attempts to shackle him and that while Mr. Trump is not ready to fire Kelly, he has begun gradually freezing out his top aide. Mr. Trump recently told one confidant that he was \"tired of being told no\" by Kelly and has instead chosen to simply not tell Kelly things at all, according to a person who was not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity. CBS News' Major Garrett reported in mid-March that congressional and administration sources had suggested that Kelly could be on his way out. And in Mr. Trump's West Wing, once the rumors begin that an aide's exit is forthcoming, the \"stink\" on that staffer never leaves, according to one of the nearly dozen White House aides, former administration officials and outside advisers who spoke to The Associated Press under the same conditions. As Kelly's public profile and behind-the-scenes influence has faded, speculation has risen that chaos could return. \"It's not tenable for Kelly to remain in this position so weakened,\" said Chris Whipple, author of \"Gatekeepers,\" a history of modern White House chiefs of staff. \"More than any of his predecessors, Donald Trump needs an empowered chief of staff to tell him what he does not want to hear. Trump wants to run the White House like the 26th floor of Trump Tower, and it's simply not going to work.\" Kelly was once a fixture at the president's side, but Mr. Trump has now cut him out of a number of important decisions. For months, Kelly made it a practice to listen in to many of the president's calls, particularly with world leaders. While he is still on the line for some of those conversations, Kelly was not part of the call Mr. Trump made to Putin last month from the White House residence during which Mr. Trump ignored advisers' advice against congratulating the Russian president on his re-election. Although Kelly had agitated for the removal of outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster, he counseled Mr. Trump against hiring Bolton, a neo-conservative media commentator. Mr. Trump did it anyway, offering the job to Bolton in a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office and telling his chief of staff about it later. As Mr. Trump spent the Easter weekend at his Florida resort and tweeted about his tariffs plan, Kelly was out of state, though the men did consult by phone. While Kelly has fumed about the ethics questions swirling around Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump was at least initially more supportive of Pruitt, telling him, \"We've got your back.\" The president also has cast aside the constraints the retired four-star Marine general tried to place on Mr. Trump about whom he could see and speak to. Those restrictions led shunned advisers to try to undermine the chief of staff in the press and with Mr. Trump. For months, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was barred from the White House, only to return when Kelly was overruled by Mr. Trump, according to four White House aides and outside advisers. Many in the West Wing believed that Kelly's attempts to curtail Mr. Trump's interactions with Lewandowski, as well as Trump allies such as David Bossie and Anthony Scaramucci, were always destined to fail and alienate the president, who has privately contemplated recreating the freewheeling nature of his campaign and Trump Tower office. Kelly also has clashed with Mr. Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, who had his security clearance downgraded after a policy change written by the chief of staff. Some White House aides contend that Kelly has been intentionally giving Mr. Trump more leeway to be himself and that Kelly recognizes that's what Mr. Trump wants. But allies acknowledged Kelly's receding power and said he's trying to keep his head down and focus on policy, such as the plan to mobilize the National Guard along the U.S. border with Mexico. The White House declined to make Kelly available for an interview. In public, Mr. Trump praises his chief of staff, telling Marines in California last month that Kelly probably \"likes what you do better than what he does, but he's doing a great job.\" The speculation surrounding Kelly echoes the treatment of his predecessor, Reince Priebus, who was the subject of months of questions about how long he would last on the job. Priebus eventually resigned under pressure. Kelly also no longer commands the same respect among some quarters of the staff. His role came under harsh scrutiny this year over his handling of the controversy surrounding ousted White House aide Rob Porter, who was accused of domestic abuse. Kelly's shifting version of events elicited frustration from former communications director Hope Hicks, who had been dating Porter, and dismayed a number of West Wing staffers. That episode frustrated Trump, who still remains agitated about an interview that Kelly gave to Fox News months ago in which he suggested that Mr. Trump had \"evolved\" in his thinking about the need for a wall on the Mexican border. Kelly, who took the job last July, had previously told confidants he hoped to be on the job for a year. One person familiar with his thinking said the chief of staff recently voiced doubt he would make it that far.",

            "article_content": "Embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt received some words of encouragement Monday night from his boss, President Trump. The president phoned Pruitt and told him to keep his head up and to keep fighting. The message from the top: We have your back, CBS News Jacqueline Alemany reports, citing an administration official. On Tuesday morning, White House chief of staff John Kelly, followed up with another phone call reiterating the president's message. Pruitt, who on Tuesday announced the rollback of Obama-era vehicle fuel standards, has attracted unwelcome headlines for the White House over his costly travel and the revelation that he paid $50 per night for a room in a Capitol Hill condominium owned by the wife of a lobbyist -- about $6,100 between February and June 2017. The calls from Mr. Trump and Kelly seem to refute reports that the White House wanted to fire Pruitt, but it's true that some of the publicity Pruitt has attracted is bothersome to the White House, and rumors persist. But CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett points out that two factors are working in Pruitt's favor right now: fear of a massive confirmation battle and Pruitt's track record. The White House is already facing three major confirmations: Mike Pompeo to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, Gina Haspel, who's stepping into Pompeo's former job of CIA director, and Ronny Jackson to replace David Shulkin as veterans affairs secretary. The administration is somewhat leery about a fourth. A fight over Pruitt's replacement would be time-consuming and difficult, adding to the burden on the White House. Another factor to consider is that conservatives like and want to protect Pruitt -- he's been aggressive about rescinding Obama regulations that industry abhors, and he shows no indication that he's slowing down. And available replacements with strong conservative backing are scant. The White House is also wary of further aggravating conservatives after signing a deficit-heavy spending bill and prompting concerns about a perceived drift in immigration. The White House is trying to motivate the base for the midterm elections, and it's possible that firing Pruitt could do the opposite.\u00a0 During a meeting with with Baltic leaders at the White House Tuesday, the president was asked by reporters whether he still supports Pruitt.\u00a0 \"I hope he's going to be great,\" Trump replied. \u00a0 But Pruitt probably shouldn't get too comfortable -- as a top Trump adviser told Garrett, \"Bad press only lasts so long. Then they fire you. Trump hates bad press. Unless he generates it.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 CBS News' Major Garrett, Jacqueline Alemany and Katiana Krawchenko contributed to this report.",

In an apparent dig at Mr. Trump, Bush also said that he returned to his family after losing the South Carolina, saying that his children \"actually love me.\" The remark prompted Donald Trump Jr. to take a shot at Bush.\u00a0 \"Jeb!

            "article_content": "Special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigators have interviewed a number of current and former Trump administration and campaign officials. Here are all the people we know so far who have spoken with Mueller's team, as they investigate Russian election meddling and any ties to Trump associates, and the dates when news outlets reported that the meetings had occurred. \u00a0 June 22, 2017 -\u00a0CNN reports\u00a0that National Security Agency (NSA) Director Mike Rogers and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Dan Coats met with the special counsel. The top intelligence officials, according to CNN, told investigators that Mr. Trump had asked them to publicly state there was no collusion between his campaign representatives and Russians. Sept. 20, 2017 - Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein interviewed by the special counsel's office about former FBI Director James Comey's firing. Rosenstein is a key figure in any investigative procedures related to Comey. It was Rosenstein who appointed special counsel Robert Mueller after Mr. Trump fired Comey. Oct. 5, 2017 - CNN reports that the special counsel's office met with the author of the \"Trump dossier\", former British spy Christopher Steele, over the summer. The unverified dossier alleges ties between Mr. Trump and Russia, and Steele compiled it for the research firm Fusion GPS, which was working on behalf of Democratic operatives.\u00a0 Oct. 13, 2017 - CBS News confirms former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus met with the special counsel. Priebus' lawyer said he \"was voluntarily interviewed.\" Priebus served as White House chief of staff from the start of Mr. Trump's presidency until July of 2017, when he was replaced by current White House chief of staff John Kelly. Priebus was the president's chief of staff during the time Mr. Trump fired Comey, and the time Mueller was appointed. Oct. 17, 2017 - Mueller's team meets with Sean Spicer, CBS News confirms. Spicer was White House press secretary from the start of the Trump administration until July, and as the to White House spokesperson during that time, Spicer is believed to have been privy to some of the administration's most important and sensitive information.\u00a0 Oct. 31, 2017 -\u00a0NBC\u00a0Reports Sam Clovis has been interviewed by the special counsel's office and the grand jury. Clovis, a former top Trump campaign official, supervised George Papadopoulos, the former Trump aide who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Nov. 3, 2017 - Dutch lawyer\u00a0Alex Van Der Zwaan\u00a0is interviewed by the special counsel's office and the FBI, and apparently misled officials about his communication with former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates. Van Der Zwaan later pleaded guilty to lying to FBI officials during that interview. Nov. 3, 2017 - CBS confirms that there have been at least four special counsel office meetings with current and former Trump White House staff, but none with top officials. The interviews up to this point had only been with mid to lower-level officials.\u00a0 Nov. 9, 2017 - Mueller has interviewed Stephen Miller, CBS News confirms. Miller is a senior adviser to the president, and has been key in pushing key agenda items for Mr. Trump, particularly immigration restrictions. Nov. 16, 2017 - CBS News reports that Georgian-American businessman Ike Kaveladze spent more than two hours at Mueller's office. Kaveladze is believed to have been present at the June 2016 Trump tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and a Russian lawyer. Nov. 29, 2017 - CBS News confirms that Jared Kushner was interviewed by the special counsel. Sources familiar with the process say the interview occurred the first week of November and lasted about 90 minutes. Kushner was present in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, and as Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, has been privy to extensive sensitive information. Kushner's legal team has handed over records related to Comey's firing. Nov. 30, 2017 - White House counsel Don McGahn is interviewed by special counsel. McGhan, CBS News has reported, threatened to resign months earlier, in June 2017. Around that time, Mr. Trump discussed the possibility of firing Mueller. December 8, 2017 - It is reported and later confirmed by CBS News that Hope Hicks has met with the special counsel's office. Hicks, who is now departing as White House communications director, was with Mr. Trump since the beginning of his campaign.\u00a0 Dec. 11, 2017-\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reports that former acting attorney general Sally Yates has been interviewed by the special counsel's office to discuss her meetings with White House officials. According to the Journal, Yates expressed concerns she had about the White House's handling of Mike Flynn, the former national security adviser ousted for misleading Vice President Mike Flynn about his contacts with Russian officials.\u00a0 Jan. 23, 2018 - CBS News confirms Mueller interviewed Sessions the prior week. Sessions has been repeatedly ridiculed by Mr. Trump for recusing himself from the Russia probe. Jan. 23, 2018 - CBS News confirms Mueller interviewed Comey in December. Comey, who has claimed Mr. Trump asked for his loyalty and pressured him to drop the Flynn matter, has been quite vocal on social media in the months since his firing and will soon be releasing a book on leadership. Jan. 24, 2018 - CBS News confirms that special counsel has interviewed CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Coats, and Rogers.\u00a0 Feb. 1, 2018 - Rick Gates interviewed by the special counsel's office. Later in the month, Gates pleads guilty to financial fraud and lying to investigators. Feb.15, 2018 - CBS News' Paula Reid reports Mueller spoke to former Trump legal team spokesman Mark Corallo for 2.5 hours. March 6, 2018 -\u00a0 George Nader, a top Arab Emirates adviser, has met in recent weeks with the special counsel's office and has been before the grand jury. Nader is reportedly cooperating with Mueller's investigation.\u00a0 March 17, 2018 - Paula Reid reports that former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe has been interviewed by the special counsel. McCabe, who has been criticized intensely by Mr. Trump, was fired by Sessions two days before he could retire this month. FBI officials had recommended that McCabe be fired, ahead of a DOJ inspector general report expected to be critical of McCabe.\u00a0 CBS News' Clare Hymes, Eleanor Watson and Kathryn Watson contributed to this report.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Something new is taking root amid the cotton and peanut fields and Gulf Coast beaches of Baldwin County, Alabama. A grassroots movement propelled by women is aiming to change politics here from the ground up. \"In Alabama we're taught that women are to be quiet, not cause trouble. But it seems like the climate has changed here,\" said Heather Brown, 42, a freelance writer, wife and mother of three who lives in the town of Summerdale. She's not causing trouble, but she's not keeping quiet either. For her, it started last fall when Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore was accused of sexual misconduct by several women, including some who said they were in their teens when it happened. \"The sexual allegations against Roy Moore came out, and we just had the #MeToo movement, and it just seemed like the perfect time and opportunity to use our voices to speak our truths,\" Brown said. Outraged and determined to take action, volunteers -- many of them new to politics -- knocked on doors and placed countless phone calls urging voters to do something Alabamians hadn't done in decades: elect a Democrat, Doug Jones, to the U.S. Senate. In the lead up to the special election in December, Brown and local women organized a protest against Moore dressed in the red cloaks and white bonnets of \"handmaids\" -- women held as men's property in the dystopian novel and TV series, \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" Doug Jones won\u00a0a hard-fought victory in a campaign watched nationwide. And Heather Brown realized she was just getting started. \"I never dreamed that this little 'handmaid' protest we were doing would change my life,\" she said. \"When we had that big win with Doug Jones, it was like, 'Oh, we can do it!' You know, the little things we were doing helped bring about that win.\" She decided to run for office herself, seeking a a seat on the Baldwin County Commission as part of a wave of new Democratic candidates challenging the local Republican power structure. Brown is one of nine Democrats -- five of them women -- now running for office in a county where the party hasn't had local candidates on the ballot in more than a decade. \"I decided to run because I want to be the change, not just talk about being the change,\" she declared. It's part of a trend seen nationwide as more women jump into political races to make their voices heard. According to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, so far this year 233 women have filed to run for U.S. Senate, House and governors races, and another 350 are considered likely to file soon -- numbers that would break records. But the newly energized Democrats in Alabama have their work cut out for them. Alabama is one of the reddest of red states, giving President Trump 62.9 percent of the vote in 2016. \"To be blue here in sea of red, you are seriously outnumbered. It takes a lot of conversation, a lot of relationship building, to show we're not really all that different,\" Brown said. Volunteer political consultant Hanh Hua is helping her get a handle on what it will take to compete. Hua, 32, grew up in Alabama after her family immigrated from Vietnam. \"I'm a weird mix of like a lot of different cultures -- of like Vietnamese, American, Southern,\" she quipped. She moved back home last year after more than a decade of living and working in Boston and Hanoi, explaining, \"I just felt, like, this weird calling that I had to be in Alabama at this time.\" She's found political organizing for the candidates and causes she supports to be a challenge, especially compared to the resources of the party in power. \"The Republican infrastructure's just super well organized and a well oiled machine,\" she said, while the state Democrats are still in startup mode. \"Actually when I consulted for the state party this summer, sometimes I wished I was Republican. I was like, 'Oh, infrastructure! Organization!' I wish I had that. But we'll slowly get there.\" One of the issues driving Heather Brown to get involved in government is health care, and for her it's personal. She works from home and cares for her husband, Randy, who is disabled from complications of diabetes. \"You don't expect at 33 to hear from doctor, to hear you'll be permanently disabled, never work again. I wasn't even 30 at time. It's changed me a lot,\" she said. \"And we went from your typical family to a family who had to struggle to raise their children. ... And I think going from somebody who knew what it was like to have the American dream and lose it, through something that you couldn't control ... I realized just how hard things can be.\" She's bonded over those experiences with her friend Katrina Hardy, 40, a health care worker who also cares for a disabled husband. \"We agree a lot on where our health care is and what needs to be done in Medicare benefits and disability benefits because both of us have husbands that are disabled,\" Hardy said. The bureaucratic problems her elderly patients encounter motivate her even more. \"You know, people like Miss Ella are why I'm going to involve myself in Washington at some point,\" she said. \"They said she hadn't met her insurance deductible. So in order for this 93-year-old sweet woman to sleep, she has to pay $345 for a 30-day prescription. That breaks my heart.\" But don't mistake Katrina Hardy for a progressive. \"I'm a big conservative,\" she declared, a proud Republican and Trump supporter who does not see eye to eye with her friend Heather on a host of other issues. Their friendship manages to transcend politics, but it isn't always easy. On a shopping trip together, the friendly banter turns divisive and Heather holds her tongue as Katrina says she doesn't want refugees or \"people from terrorist countries\" coming to America. Later she reflects, \"Katrina is probably more representative of the majority of Alabama, especially Baldwin County, than I would be. But Katrina and I can talk about health care and use that to build a relationship where you can talk about things like immigration, that you don't agree on, and still stay civil.\" Back home with Randy, Heather gets some encouragement not to give up. \"You're part of a big movement that's needed to happen for quite some time and it's nothin' but a good thing and it's gaining momentum every day,\" he tells her. \"I mean, I'm tired of the good old boy system. The good old boy system ain't done nothin' in the last 12-16 years in lower Alabama. It's time for the good old girl system.\" She laughs, \"I like that! We're gonna start a new trend.\" She celebrated the news that she's qualified for the ballot, and even though she admits the odds are stacked against her, she's keeping up the fight. \"I want to make sure when I have grandchildren, that they come into a word that is receptive to them no matter what. Maybe I want their future to not be a fight to be them.\"",

            "article_content": "Two inordinately wealthy front-runners who have largely bankrolled their campaigns for Illinois governor faced nomination challenges Tuesday in a primary that also features a self-described \"middle-class candidate,\" a member of a famous political family and an insurgent state legislator. With Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic businessman J.B. Pritzker combining to spend more than $120 million out of their own pockets so far on the contest, the battle for Illinois' top job is on pace to top California in 2010 as the most expensive governor's race in U.S. history. The 61-year-old governor, a former venture capitalist serving in his first public office, took advantage of a national GOP wave four years ago to pull off a surprising victory in a state otherwise dominated by Democrats. Rauner's personal wealth is just shy of $1 billion, but Pritzker \u2014 an investor and one of the heirs to the Hyatt hotel chain \u2014 is worth several times more. Pritzker, 53, has poured nearly $70 million into capturing a Democratic nomination that has proved tougher than initially expected. The field also includes developer Chris Kennedy, the 54-year-old son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy; and Daniel Biss, 40, a state senator who for much of the campaign joked that he only gave himself $25 \u2014 drawing a contrast to his far wealthier opponents. Rauner has his own GOP challenge from 53-year-old state Rep. Jeanne Ives. She has raised just $4 million \u2014 less than any of the other prominent candidates, but has attacked the governor's conservative credentials in edgy TV ads. One of them, which the chairman of the state GOP blasted as a \"cowardly attempt to stoke political division,\" portrays actors mockingly thanking Rauner for not doing enough to restrict illegal immigration, abortion and transgender bathroom rights. In other races on the Illinois primary ballot, former Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn \u2014 whom Rauner ousted in 2014 \u2014 was locked in a tough competition with state Sen. Kwame Raoul for state attorney general. There also are numerous contested congressional primary races, including progressive candidate Marie Newman's challenge to seven-term Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski. But none involved the kind of spending as seen in the governor's race. Personal wealth solidified Rauner and Pritzker's front-runner status but also made them frequent targets for opponent attacks. Even Kennedy spent $2 million of his own money on the race. Biss, a Harvard-educated mathematician who gave up teaching to enter politics, set up a website to track what he says is a $171,000-a-day campaign by Pritzker. The Democratic front-runner has been advertising on television from nearly the moment he announced his candidacy 11 months ago. Pritzker's opponents also have attacked his connections with overseas trusts in low-tax countries, though he maintains they're focused on charitable giving and that he has no control over them. In response, Biss has called him a \"fraud\" while Kennedy labeled him a \"liar.\" But far more damaging were ads that Rauner ran against Pritzker after wiretap audio surfaced of him talking with former Gov. Rod Blagojevich. The ads included a 30-minute infomercial-style ad with the full FBI recordings. Rauner took on Pritzker again when more tapes surfaced from the Chicago Tribune. They revealed Pritzker describing Secretary of State Jesse White \u2014 a Pritzker backer \u2014 as the \"least offensive\" black officeholder to be considered for the Senate seat vacated by then-President-elect Barack Obama. Pritzker has apologized, and White continues to back him. Although Biss has built his campaign around claiming to be the \"middle-class candidate,\" he has faced criticism as the architect of a plan to cut the roughly $100 billion gap in pension funding for the cash-strapped state by reducing some of the promised retirement benefits. Although he says he has learned his lesson and won't support it again, Pritzker has repeatedly criticized his change of heart. Biss and Kennedy have teamed up against Pritzker for his silence on whether Michael Madigan, the longest-serving state House speaker in modern American history, should step aside because of criticism about how he handled sexual harassment complaints by campaign workers against two of his political aides. Rauner also has invoked Madigan in his ads against Ives, calling her \"Mike Madigan's favorite Republican and Illinois' worst nightmare.\" Rauner rolled to victory in 2014 with a promise to \"shake up\" Springfield with a pro-business, anti-union agenda including lower property taxes and term limits on officeholders. But his ongoing spat with Madigan and other legislative Democrats left the state without a budget for two years while billions of dollars of debt piled up.",

            "article_content": "With the public firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson this week, the Trump White House appears to be doing some spring cleaning, and may remove other administration figures from their posts in the coming days. \"[T]he president wants to make sure that he has the right people in the right places for the right time,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Thursday. As CBS News' chief White House correspondent Major Garrett reports, in the Trump administration, nothing is certain until it happens, but there are rumblings that President Trump isn't yet finished with his\u00a0staff shakeup. Here are the Cabinet members that are at risk of meeting Tillerson's fate: \u00a0 National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster could be the next top administration official to go, as CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett has reported. If McMaster is ousted, he is expected to be replaced by former Bush administration official and frequent Fox News guest John Bolton, who is known for his hawkish views on Iran and North Korea.  Speculation over McMaster's future has ensued for weeks, and he's made public comments putting him at odds with the commander-in-chief. McMaster told the New York Times in December that Mr. Trump's approach to foreign policy \"has moved a lot of us out of our comfort zone, me included.\" Earlier this year while speaking overseas, after special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians for influencing U.S. elections, McMaster said evidence of Russian meddling is \"beyond dispute.\" Mr. Trump didn't take that well, tweeting shortly thereafter that McMaster, \"forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\" Congressional sources and White House advisers tell CBS News that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson is in serious jeopardy. There is an expectation he will not last the week in the Trump administration. Carson's troubles largely stem from the $31,000 in furniture ordered by Carson's office last year, a fact detailed extensively in emails released by the watchdog group American Oversight on Wednesday. This hasn't made the president happy. A spokesman for the department initially said Carson had no involvement in the lavish purchase. But internal emails claimed Carson and his wife, Candy Carson, selected the pieces themselves.  The emails also revealed HUD employees devoted months of staff time to remedying Carson's furniture situation, and there was pressure to find a workaround to exceed the $5,000 statutory limit for refurbishing his office.\u00a0 Asked about the purchase on Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders only said that the matter is being reviewed.\u00a0 \"This is something we're looking into \u2014 I don't have any updates at this time,\" Sanders said.\u00a0 Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin could be fired by President Trump and replaced with Energy Secretary Rick Perry. The threats of a reshuffling comes after months of turmoil for Shulkin, who was subject of an internal watchdog investigation surrounding the secretary's travel expenses for a trip to Europe last year. The investigation found that Shulkin had improperly accepted Wimbledon tennis tickets and likely used taxpayer money to cover his wife's airfare for an 11-day European trip. The report also questioned Shulkin's decision to direct agency staff on official time to arrange personal sightseeing activities for him and his wife during the July trip to England and Denmark. Shulkin said he realized the \"optics are not good\" and planned to reimburse the Treasury Department.\u00a0 A more recent watchdog report faulted \"failed leadership\" and a \"climate of complacency\" for putting patients at risk at a D.C. VA hospital while Shulkin was serving as the department's under secretary during the Obama administration. The report said that at least three program offices had sufficient information to inform Shulkin of prevalent safety issues at the medical center but Shulkin took no action to resolve the problems. The secretary said that he \"does not recall\" senior leaders bringing the issues to his attention and had only found out of the systemic issues about a year ago. Perry has since denied having in interest in Shulkin's job, saying he's staying put at Energy \"until the foreseeable future -- happily.\" Sanders said at Thursday's press briefing of the ongoing turmoil at the VA: \"The president has a large number of individuals that are working to make sure that the VA is helping veterans at the best level possible. We are continuing to review if we can improve on that system.\" President Trump's Education Secretary Betsy DeVos came under widespread criticism for her lackluster response to questions from 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl about schools in her home state of Michigan. DeVos struggled with basic questions about how Michigan is dealing with underperforming public schools. Asked by Stahl if she had seen the schools herself to figure out how to best address the ongoing issues, DeVos replied \"I have not, I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she's not sure if the president saw the entire interview. But sources tell CBS News' Major Garrett that administration officials inside and outside the White House are regarding the interview as uneven and ill-prepared.  Her poor performance follows months of similar blunders \u2014 most notably calling historically black colleges and universities \"pioneers of school choice.\" She is frequently met by protesters and hecklers for championing school choice proposals.\u00a0 However, for now she still has a vote of confidence from the president, who put DeVos in charge of a commission that will focus on school safety\u00a0in the wake of the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. One of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, John Kelly, is potentially in the crosshairs of the president's staff shake-up. According to congressional and administration sources, Kelly, who was made chief of staff over the summer in an attempt to bring order to the West Wing, may be on the way out.  Kelly himself had reportedly offered to step down over the way he handled the allegations of domestic abuse against now-former staff secretary Rob Porter.

The president has expressed frustration over Session's decision to recuse himself in the Russia probe \u2014 a decision Sessions has stood by \u2014 and over what sees as Sessions' failure to investigate the president's former opponent, Hillary Clinton.  But Sessions has also been in charge of implementing policies Mr. Trump campaigned on, such as cracking down on illegal immigration and the \"sanctuary cities\" that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\u00a0 CBS News' Kathryn Watson, Emily Tillett, Major Garrett and Jacqueline Alemany contributed to this report.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Trump has been known for making colorful and shocking remarks \u2014 arguably, it helped elect him. But on Saturday night, he stumped for Republican candidate Rick Saccone ahead of Tuesday's special election in a raucous speech that seemed to go off script.\u00a0 Mr. Trump, in his speech that lasted longer than an hour and jumped from subject to subject and insult to insult, managed to to touch on issues ranging from denuclearizing North Korea to how much he dislikes NBC's \"sleepy\" host Chuck Todd and \"low IQ\" Rep. Maxine Waters. Mr. Trump appeared to speak about whatever he liked, and however he wanted to approach it. He even made fun of the criticism that he should act more presidential, mimicking what the thinks \"presidential\" sounds like.\u00a0 In his element, and among his fiercest supporters, the president let loose. Here are some of the most eye-catching things Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump claimed that South Korea's president Moon Jae-in told him that the Pyeongchang Olympics would have fallen apart without Mr. Trump. \"Well, I'll tell you we did a great job with the Olympics,\" Mr. Trump said. \"President Moon said without Donald Trump the Olympics would have been a total failure. It's true.\" \"Well, it's a little hard to sell tickets when you think you're going to be nuked. But when North Korea called and they said we'd like to be in the Olympics everybody said let's buy tickets, let's go. I would have gone and it became a very, very successful Olympics. Honestly South Korea did a great job and it was great to see North Korea going and participating and there was nice unity. It was really a nice thing.\" \"They're not going to send missiles up. Think of it. They're not sending missiles up and I believe that. I believe that. I really do. I think they want to something. I think they want to make peace. I think it's time and I think we've shown great strength.\" That comment came after Mr. Trump shocked Washington and the world Thursday night by saying he has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by May.\u00a0 Mr. Trump, in a string of comments criticizing specific media outlets and personalities, was particularly tough on NBC's Chuck Todd.\u00a0 \"Chuck Todd,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's a sleeping son of a bitch. I'll tell you and they showed it this morning -- 1999 and I'm talking about North Korea you got to take them out now and then they have Clinton saying 'we are pleased to announce that we have made a deal with North Korea.' Well you know how that deal turned out right. We gave billions and billions of dollars and lots of other things and we got nothing, but they show me. Young, handsome.\" Mr. Trump dismissed the intelligence of African American U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, who has said Congress should move towards impeaching him.\u00a0 \"She's a low-IQ individual,\" Mr. Trump said, a claim he repeated several times.\u00a0 Oprah Winfrey has shot down the suggestion that she should run for office, but Mr. Trump hasn't give up on it.\u00a0 \"I'd love Oprah to win. I'd love to beat Oprah. I know her weakness,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No, no I know her weakness. You know I know her very well. I was on her last show or one of the last \u2014 I guess the last week. She had Donald Trump and Donald Trump's family. My, my, my we've come down a long way haven't we? I'm now president and probably you know - but, but think of it, I know her weakness. Wouldn't we love to run against Oprah? I would love it. I would love it. That would be a painful experience for her.\" Saturday was not the first time Mr. Trump has marveled at countries that execute drug dealers, including a comment last week at a summit on the opioid crisis. But he brought up the suggestion again Saturday night, saying countries with that policy \"don't have a problem.\" \"If somebody goes and shoots somebody, or kills somebody, they go away for life and they can even get the death penalty, right? ... A drug dealer will kill 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 people during the course of his or her life. Thousands of people are killed or their lives are destroyed, their families are destroyed. So you can kill thousands of people and go to jail for 30 days.\" \"They're killing our kids,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're killing our families.\" \"I think it's a discussion we have to start thinking about,\" Mr. Trump continued.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has long made a key tenet of his presidency clearing out gangs like MS-13, and he linked their crime to \"sanctuary cities\" \u2014 localities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities \u2014 on Saturday. \"So the Democrats are the party of sanctuary cities,\" the president said. \"Explain that one, right? They like to protect criminals. They like to protect MS-13 ... How about that. How about that? How about ICE? (Immigration and Customs Enforcement.) These ICE guys are tough as hell. They go in and they are not playing games. You know, the only thing I hate to say, not so politically correct, but the only thing these gang members understand is toughness. I hate to say it. They're not interested in genius. They're not interested - they're interested in somebody who is tougher than them that's what and we have the toughest people you've ever seen and they went out in Long Island and they grabbed them by the neck and they threw them in the paddy. We're cleaning out. We're doing it.\" The president mocked the criticism that he should act more \"presidential.\" He then attempted to make himself seem as even and dull as possible with his hand motions, tone, body language and words.\u00a0 \"Remember how easy it is to be presidential? But you'd all be out of here right now. You'd be so bored,\" Mr. Trump said, going into his impression of what that would look like.\u00a0 Bo Erickson and Kathryn Watson contributed to this report.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Trump will attend the upcoming Summit of the Americas in April, putting him face-to-face with Western Hemisphere leaders, many of whom are upset by his policies toward the region. The White House confirmed Mr. Trump's attendance Friday. The regional summit next month in Peru is seen as the leading forum for projecting U.S. leadership in Latin America and the Caribbean. U.S. presidents have participated in all seven previous gatherings, but with Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, proposal to build a wall on the Mexican border and stance on trade stirring anger throughout the region, many wondered if he would attend. \"There will be some very uncomfortable meetings there,\" said Christopher Sabatini, a lecturer in international relations at Columbia University. In recent years, U.S. leaders have faced sharp rebuke from leftist Latin Americans at the periodic gathering and this year's event is likely to be no different. But the upcoming summit is also generating controversy because of a leader at the other end of the political spectrum: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Peruvian leaders have repeatedly said Maduro isn't invited to attend as international criticism grows over Venezuela's human rights record and the nation's increasingly autocratic government. But Maduro recently said he is determined to attend, \"rain, shine or lightning.\" \"By air, land or sea - I will get to the Summit of the Americas to tell the truth of this country,\" he vowed at a news conference for international journalists. Mercedes Araoz, the chief of Peru's Cabinet of Ministers, later quipped back that Maduro cannot come by \"land nor Peruvian airspace because he is not welcome.\" Peru and the United States have emerged as two of the most outspoken nations in voicing their objections to Maduro's rule as Venezuela struggles with hyperinflation, food and medical shortages, and a growing exodus of its citizens fleeing to other parts of the region. Both have also criticized snap presidential elections being held in April that key opposition leaders are boycotting. Peruvian Foreign Minister Cayetana Aljovin reiterated Friday that Maduro is not invited, saying only presidents committed to \"governability, democracy and fighting corruption\" can attend. \"There's a real risk of a very undiplomatic showdown that could occur,\" Sabatini said of the ongoing squabble with Maduro. \"He's already been disinvited. It would be strange, odd to have him re-invited. And if he should just show up, can Peru deny him entry?\" Former President Bill Clinton first invited all hemispheric leaders except Cuba's Fidel Castro to gather in Miami in 1994 to promote a free trade zone ranging from Alaska to the tip of South America. U.S. leaders have gotten an earful from their Latin American counterparts in more recent years. Protesters led by soccer legend Diego Maradona burned an effigy of President George W. Bush to protest the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq at the 2005 summit in Argentina. Four years later, the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez famously gave then President Barack Obama a copy of a classic leftist book, \"The Open Veins of Latin America,\" detailing the history of U.S. military interventions in the region. The theme of this year's summit is \"democratic governance against corruption,\" a topic that has embroiled nearly every country in the region. Peru's own president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, was nearly impeached in December after an opposition-led investigation revealed his private consulting firm had received payments from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht over a decade before. Odebrecht admitted in a 2016 U.S. Justice Department agreement to paying nearly $800 million in kickbacks to politicians, their campaigns and political parties to secure lucrative public works contracts. Sabatini said it was a \"positive\" development that Mr. Trump would have face-to-face meetings with regional leaders, but added there are a range of topics likely to be raised that may make the U.S. president uncomfortable. Aside from immigration and the Mexico border wall, his administration's partial rollback of Obama's Cuba policy and new, steep tariffs he recently ordered against steel and aluminum imports to the U.S. are almost certain to come up in the discussions. \"There are a lot of open questions and a lot of points of friction,\" Sabatini said. Following Trump's trip to Peru he is expected to travel on to Bogota, a Colombian government official confirmed to the AP Friday. Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin however later stated Colombia was still awaiting the official confirmation of Trump's visit.",

            "article_content": "The preacher and the president, seated side-by-side Wednesday in the lit-for-television Capitol Rotunda, leaned a few inches closer. The Rev. Franklin Graham whispered something to President Trump, who listened as he kept his eyes on the pine casket at the center of the room. They were there to honor Graham's father, the Rev. Billy Graham, pastor to presidents of any party and minister to millions more over seven decades. But that fleeting moment\u00a0was a sign that the son has the ear of a president, and the kind of access to power that the elder Graham came to regret. \"Looking back, I know I sometimes crossed the line, and I wouldn't do that now,\" Billy Graham told Christianity Today in 2011. \"My father would not be comfortable with all of the attention in the Rotunda today,\" Franklin Graham, 65, tweeted after the rare salute this week from political leaders to a religious one. Mr. Trump attended Friday as Franklin Graham offered the eulogy at his father's funeral in Charlotte, North Carolina. The elder Graham died last week at age 99. Like Mr. Trump with Twitter, Billy Graham used the cutting-edge technology of his age \u2014 television \u2014 to spread his message across the nation and around the world. What Mr. Trump might call Graham's \"brand\" was both evangelical and inclusive. The preacher, meanwhile, counseled a dozen presidents and grew especially close to Richard Nixon \u2014 until the backstory of Watergate made Graham feel used by the disgraced president. He grew wary after that of mixing pastoral work with partisan politics. Not so, Franklin Graham with Mr. Trump. The younger Graham never explicitly endorsed Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, but the two have in many ways been ideological siblings for years on issues like immigration. They share much the same audience of white evangelicals who form the core of the president's base of support. \"Having Franklin Graham, who was so instrumental, we won so big, with evangelical Christians,\" Mr. Trump said after the 2016 election at a rally in Alabama. Exit polls suggested 81 percent of white evangelical voters cast ballots for Mr. Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. There are gaps between some evangelical teachings and Mr. Trump's agenda \u2014 and certainly his conduct \u2014 some scholars say, setting up several potential points of conflict between Graham and Mr. Trump. One is Mr. Trump's record on women. He's accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct, and he was heard on an \"Access Hollywood\" recording from 2005 boasting of grabbing women. Mr. Trump denies he's ever done so, and Graham has been quoted saying Mr. Trump has changed since then. Also, Mr. Trump emphasizes power and strength over helping the poor and the powerless, a priority for evangelical Christians and especially Graham's charity, Samaritan's Purse. He does, though, give money to Graham's and other charities. \"I think it likely that, as his father's relationship with Richard Nixon proved to be a low point in his long ministry, Franklin's relationship with President Trump will come to embarrass him,\" said William Martin, author of \"A Prophet with Honor: The Billy Graham Story.\" For now, more than a year into Mr. Trump's presidency, the two remain aligned. Just after Franklin Graham whispered to Mr. Trump, the president delivered a tribute to Billy Graham and said that his own father, Fred Trump, had been a fan. Mr. Trump and his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, have personally donated to Samaritan's Purse, which was involved in relief work after Hurricane Harvey. Mr. Trump's inaugural committee also kicked in money for several hurricane relief groups, including Graham's. And much of Mr. Trump's policy agenda aligns with those of evangelicals, who backed his nomination of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. Like Mr. Trump, Franklin Graham questioned at one point why former President Barack Obama didn't quickly produce a birth certificate to prove he was born in the United States (he was born in Hawaii). Graham spoke at Mr. Trump's inauguration, saying, that, \"In the Bible, rain is the sign of God's blessing, and it started to rain, Mr. President, when you came to the platform.\" He was one of the few religious leaders who offered support for Mr. Trump's proposal to sharply limit immigrants from certain nations. The preacher said in a statement that he backed a closer examination of refugees' views on \"freedom and liberty\" and that Islamic law was incompatible with the Constitution. Graham also has said he can separate the conduct of the thrice-married Mr. Trump before he was president from the Mr. Trump who now occupies the White House. \"If Franklin, in his theological universe, understands Trump to have confessed and asked for forgiveness, then there's no problem,\" said Anne Blue Wills, a religion professor at Davidson College near Charlotte, North Carolina. There's certainly been no public apology from the president. And she pointed out that thanks to Twitter and widespread White House leaks, Mr. Trump's presidential troubles are extremely public. \"Franklin, it seems to me, has his eyes open a little wider with respect to Trumps' foibles\" than Billy Graham and his wife did with Nixon, she said.",

            "article_content": "World stock markets posted steep declines Friday, adding to global losses after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose stiff steel and aluminum tariffs, sparking fears of a trade war. Dow futures were pointing to a lower open for U.S. stocks on Friday.\u00a0 \"Trump's announcement of 25 percent tariffs on U.S. steel imports and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports rattled markets\" on Thursday, wrote Gregory Daco, head of U.S. economics at Oxford Economics, in a research note.\u00a0 He added, \"The tariffs will significantly raise domestic steel and aluminum prices, benefitting steel producers. However, this will be more than offset by higher input costs for steel consuming sectors \u2013 the net impact on the US economy being higher inflation and lower growth.\" KEEPING SCORE: European shares sank in early trading. France's CAC 40 lost 1.2 percent to 5,197.52 and Germany's DAX shed 1.7 percent to 11,989.37. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.6 percent to 7,135.70. Wall Street was poised to open lower. Dow futures were down 0.3 percent at 24,558.00 and broader S&P 500 futures dipped less than 0.1 percent to 2,677.80. ASIAN SCORECARD: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 2.2 percent to close at 21,181.64 and South Korea's Kospi slid 1 percent to end at 2,402.16. Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.5 percent to 30,583.45 and the Shanghai Composite in mainland China fell 0.6 percent to 3,254.53. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 sank 0.7 percent to 5,929.90. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Southeast Asia also lost ground. TARIFF TROUBLE: In his latest move to follow through on campaign promises of an \"America First\" trade policy, Trump told industry executives he planned to levy penalties of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports. He said the tariffs would be in place for \"a long period of time,\" though it wasn't immediately clear if certain trading partners would be exempt. The comments renewed investor concerns that increasingly nationalistic governments will impose barriers hurting the global economy and trade. ANALYST INSIGHT: \"Markets are clearly concerned that Trump's move to impose tariffs will spark retaliation from other countries or trade blocs, which could be the start of a trade war,\" analysts Bas van Geffen and Elwin de Groot of Rabobank wrote in a commentary. CHINA SESSION: Also on investors' radar is next week's annual session of China's National People's Congress. The meeting of the rubber-stamp parliament's 3,000-plus delegates is mainly ceremonial but China's Communist leaders use it to publicize new initiatives and set the tone for the year's development plans. Investors will be looking to see whether Beijing brings in painful reforms to curb surging debt and overhaul state industry while widening the economy to private competitors. WEEK AHEAD: Other risk events for the markets include elections and central bank meetings. Italians go to the polls on Sunday in a vote in which the main contenders include parties supporting anti-European, anti-immigration and populist positions. Policymakers at central banks in Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan are set to hold scheduled meetings, though no big changes are expected. CURRENCIES: The dollar weakened to a fresh 15-month low, slipping to 105.69 yen from 106.24 yen late Thursday. The euro rose to $1.2269 from $1.2263. ENERGY: Oil prices resumed falling. Benchmark U.S. crude dipped 19 cents to $60.80 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract lost 65 cents to settle at $60.99 per barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 6 cents to $63.77 a barrel.",

Jeff Flake, R-Arizona told \"CBS This Morning\" he believes President Trump has a \"better chance\" he'll lead and get out in front of the gun debate after an over\u00a0hour-long meeting at the White House. Flake, a vocal critic of Mr. Trump as of late, was in attendance for the meeting where he said there's a \"number of things\" lawmakers can get progress on as the pressure mounts for Congress to act on gun legislation.\u00a0 \"His leadership here is really critical if it's going to get through the House and Senate,\" Flake said of any potential gun laws.\u00a0 The outgoing senator has introduced a new bipartisan measure along with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, to raise the minimum age to purchase assault weapons from 18 to 21, a proposal the president has previously voiced interest in supporting.\u00a0 \"I think there's a number of things we can do and if we do them all, we'll make a difference,\" he said.\u00a0 Flake acknowledged that the meeting, which the press was allowed to document in its entirety, had a similar feeling to the one held on immigration reform, which he said yielded little results.\u00a0 \"We heard a lot of good things that Tuesday but by Thursday a lot had been walked back,\" Flake said.\u00a0 Flake said of the latest meeting, that much of what the president discussed on Wednesday was \"remarkable.\"\u00a0 \"It was remarkable for him to say, hey, put this as part of the bill, why don't you have this part of the bill. Most remarkable was his statement on due process, anything that we have introduced in the Congress respects due process, you got to do that. So it was a bit astonishing to hear his language there and people around the table were kind of shaking their heads,\" said Flake. He added, \"But you can chalk that up to, he misspoke, let's move ahead, so I think there's a lot of excitement afterwards that he might actually lead on this and we need that.\" Mr. Trump criticized members of Congress for not acting on gun legislation because they're \"afraid\" of the NRA. Flake, someone who has received campaign donations and backing by the gun lobby, says he's now more willing to voice his concerns and disagree with the organization without the pressure of a re-election campaign.\u00a0 \"But now, having the president say 'I'm ok with these things' will mean a lot to some of my colleagues,\" he said. Flake said he's now \"freed of political considerations\" which led him to make the decision to retire from the Senate.\u00a0 \"I didn't want to go for this last year just beholden to the time involved, one, the fundraising and everything else, I thought it was important somebody stand up and I'm concerned\u00a0 about the direction of the administration on a number of issues,\" he added.

            "article_content": "Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, is pleading with the president to not release a classified memo penned by the staff of Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, that details alleged surveillance abuses by the FBI that targeted members of the Trump campaign during the\u00a02016 presidential election. Manchin told \"CBS This Morning\" that Nunes has \"neutered the credibility of this Intelligence Committee on the House\" and it would be \"wrong\" to release the memo. \"I would definitely say Mr. President, please don't do that, that is wrong, it is absolutely wrong,\" Manchin said. \"The Senate Intelligence Committee is the only thing we have left that can put confidence into the system and also into the investigation.\" Members of the House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines Monday to make the four-page document public. In the same meeting, the committee voted against publicly releasing a memo drafted by the minority and intended as a rebuttal to the majority's document. The memo is said to contain evidence that the FBI wrongly relied on an unverified dossier compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele to\u00a0secure surveillance warrants\u00a0under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It was sent to President Trump Monday evening, but he has not yet seen it. But as the president was exiting the House chambers on Tuesday, he appeared to joke to Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-South Carolina about the prospects of him releasing the memo. \"Let's release the memo,\" Duncan told the president after the conclusion of the speech. \"Oh yeah, don't worry, 100 percent,\" Mr. Trump responded, waving his hand as he did. Mr. Trump added, \"Can you imagine that?\" Then, pointing to another member of Congress, said, \"He'd be too angry.\" As for the possibility of Mr. Trump firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller in the throes of his own Russia investigation, Manchin again said it would be the \"absolute wrong thing\" for Mr. Trump to do. The New York Times reported\u00a0last week that Mr. Trump had ordered the firing of Mueller in June 2017 but eventually backed down after White House Counsel Don McGahn threatened to resign rather than tell the Justice Department to dismiss Mueller. However, sources directly involved in the deliberations tell CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett that\u00a0McGahn's threat was not a direct response\u00a0to an order by Mr. Trump to dismiss Mueller. \u00a0 \"I pray to God that doesn't happen for the sake of our country and I would say for the presidency and his administration that would be the absolute wrong thing,\" said Manchin. He added, \"then you will see Congress cohere around this system to protect the judicial system and protect Mr. Mueller. I really believe that, so I believe that would be a wrong move.\" Manchin did, however, applaud the president's performance during Tuesday night's State of the Union address, saying he \"showed respect for the president.\" Mr. Trump touted the administration's wins over the course of his first year in office, including overhauling the nation's tax code and boosting the U.S. economy while pushing Congress to pass immigration reform in a bipartisan fashion.\u00a0 Asked if it would be easier or harder for fellow Democrats to work with the president after his address, Manchin said, \"I can't speak for the rest of \u00a0my caucus, I really can't, but we're all Americans, whether you're Democrat or Republican, you got to make this place work and you got to reach across the aisle.\" Manchin, who described himself as a \"very independent\" member of his caucus, said he was also happy to hear Mr. Trump cover issues like nation's dwindling infrastructure, the\u00a0opioid crisis and clean coal during his speech to the joint session of Congress.\u00a0 \"There's so much we need to do, John, and just to sit there and frown is not going to fix anything, so let's embrace each other and try to make it work and when we disagree we can to work through that,\" he said. \u00a0He added, \"I'm going to do what I think is right, that's the way I was raised.\" Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

Ryan was asked about the memo that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted to publicly declassify a day earlier. The memo outlines alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The decision to release it will ultimately be made by President Trump. Asked why Republicans aren't allowing Democrats to release their memo, Ryan said that they're going through a \"process.\" He said that they're also confident that Republicans are \"protecting any sources and methods\" by voting to release their version.  \"There may have been malfeasance at the FBI by certain individuals,\" Ryan added. \"So it is our job in conducting transparent oversight of the executive branch to get to the bottom of that. Sunshine is the best disinfectant.\" The House, meanwhile, is set to vote for the third time on a spending bill that would provide new funding to the military. Senate Democrats are opposed to such a bill because they want a budget deal first that raises spending ceilings for both defense programs and non-defense domestic programs.  Ryan called on Democrats to not hold military funding \"hostage\" and tie it to negotiations over an immigration deal.  Ahead of Mr. Trump's first official State of the Union address Tuesday night, Ryan said that, \"Honestly, the State of the Union is looking up.\" He said that wages are rising, and economic confidence is \"coming back to America.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump makes his second appearance before a joint session of Congress Tuesday night to deliver his first State of the Union address. It's expected that he will tout America's economic growth and take credit for the nearly 40 percent rise in the stock market since his election. \"It's a big speech and an important speech,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"Well, I hope it's going to be good. It's going to -- we worked on it hard. Cover a lot of territory, including our great success with the markets and with the tax cut.\" For a president who often complains that his successes are underreported, the unfiltered primetime address is a key opportunity to push his agenda. Advisers say Mr. Trump will echo many of the business-friendly themes he spoke about last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"America is open for business and we are competitive once again,\" he said at the gathering. Some of the other highlights ahead for Tuesday night\u00a0include a promise of improved trade deals, a $1.7 trillion plan to revitalize infrastructure and a request to Congress for $25 billion to construct a border wall with Mexico. In exchange, he'll offer to grant a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants. \"We're going to get something done,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We hope it's going to be bipartisan because the Republicans really don't have the votes to get it done in any other way so it has to be bipartisan.\" One thing absent from the speech: the Russia investigation hanging over the White House. CBS News asked White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders if Mr. Trump feels there's a need to address the probe. \"I think we've addressed it every single day that we've been here,\" she said. \"It's certainly not the thing that keeps people up at night. We'd love to talk about all of the things that do.\" The president and first lady Melania Trump have invited 15 guests to attend the speech Tuesday night -- including two injured veterans and five individuals who have personal ties to the immigration crackdown including victims of the MS-13 gang members.

            "article_content": "As Donald Trump and his advisers prepare for his primetime State of the Union address Tuesday night, the opposition will also be hard at work getting ready for a major speech of its own: the Democratic response. It's a time-honored tradition for the party out of power to deliver a rebuttal of the president's speech \u2013 and a monumentally difficult undertaking that has elevated the national prospects of some while relegating many others to irrelevance or worse, mockery. The State of the Union, with all its grandeur \u2013 delivered from the well of the House of Representatives before the nation's lawmakers, the Cabinet, and the Supreme Court justices, is an awfully hard act to follow \u2013 for anyone.\u00a0 \t  This year, Democrats have selected\u00a0Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Massachusetts, for the job. In choosing the latest scion of Camelot, Democrats are hoping to show up the ill-mannered, outsider 71-year-old \u2013 who's shown tendencies toward racism, sexism, and outright boorishness \u2013 with his polar opposite. The 37-year-old Kennedy is the fresh-faced Harvard-trained lawyer steeped in public service in the generations-old tradition of his storied family. And the only thing he drinks is espresso. Kennedy is the Democratic Party's ideal of a young man. \t \t Here's how Kennedy can take advantage of the opportunity before him:   Focus on the kitchen table. It will be critical that Kennedy starts with pocketbook concerns without getting lost in the weeds of policy to show that the Democratic Party understands the challenges facing working people in America. The response will land well if it's centered on access to affordable health care rather than the brinksmanship around CHIP; on creating good-paying jobs that can support a family rather than on the unemployment rate; and on expanding opportunity for us and our children, rather than on the mind-numbing details of tax policy.  Remind America that Donald Trump has failed to live up to his campaign promises. The sole legislative accomplishment of the Trump administration in its first year in office has been a tax bill that increases the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion and rewards millionaires with a bigger boon in breaks and loopholes than any previous administration - all while hurting middle class Americans over the long term by pushing 13 million off health care and reducing benefits for those making less than $75,00 per year.\u00a0   Polling heading into the vote last year showed a majority of Americans saw the deal as a giveaway to the wealthy - and the numbers haven't gotten better for the GOP as the calendar marches on -- either on the tax bill or on its opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Without re-litigating debate over the tax bill, Kennedy should call out President Trump on his campaign claims that he'd help working people. He should offer examples illustrating how much the tax plan is helping the one-percenters, how his decimation of environmental regulations is benefiting oil and energy interests, and how he's installing Wall Street bankers to lead key government offices.   Broaden the message to reach rural America as well the urban centers. Rural America was a primary factor in Donald Trump's election. Yet in one of his first moves in office, Mr. Trump proposed a budget that would cut critical resources from programs ranging from rural development to water, from job training to airports. Where the president will seek to highlight wins in his first year in office to shore up his base, Kennedy would do well to point out where his administration's actions have failed to match up to his rhetoric.   Touch on the scandals, but don't dwell on the details. The endless headlines since 2016 linking this administration to everything from Russian collusion to obstruction of justice to an alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels and a second round of outrage over the infamous \"grab 'em by the p*ssy\" tapes have doubtless had an impact on the president's approval ratings, earning him the distinction of having the lowest popularity of any president in his first year of office in polling history. As such, a simple reference to the controversy will suffice - enough to remind viewers of their own discomfort with the daily controversies without derailing Kennedy's overall remarks from its substantive framework.   Throw down the gauntlet for Congressional Republicans. Inherent in all of the arguments made by Joe Kennedy must be a direct challenge to Republicans in Congress. It makes sense that GOP electeds have wanted to stand by the leader of their Party - especially when his agenda has aligned with the priorities of their donors as it did with the Trump tax bill. But the Democratic response to the State of the Union is as good a time as any to remind Republicans on the Hill - and their constituents back home - that their real allegiance must be to taxpayers and the people who elected them, or they should suffer the consequence in November.   Bring it all back to our values as Americans. There is always more that unites us than divides us, and this is one of the most important themes for Kennedy to hit. It won't be enough to highlight the challenges we face as nation. He'll need to call on our better angels and pay homage to this great cultural experiment called America -- whether he is talking about immigration reform that honors our values of inclusiveness or responding to an infrastructure plan that speaks to American ingenuity and hard work. And in the wake of everything we've witnessed so far from the Trump administration, Kennedy should remind us all of what Barack Obama called in his own inaugural speech \"a recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world - duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly.\"   It's hard to overemphasize the challenge of delivering the official State of the Union response. Coming on the heels of the State of the Union, the contrast of a lengthy direct-to-camera speech against live audience remarks by the Commander-in-Chief, it usually comes across as stilted and rehearsed, if not painfully mechanical. While Kennedy has shown great promise as a speaker - his floor speech skewering the administration on the Affordable Care Act went viral and his remarks in the aftermath of the Charlottesville white supremacist rally received upwards of 15 million views - history has not been kind to those who deliver the official response. And there's always the risk of creating a moment that overshadows the response entirely, whether it's Marco Rubio's parched mouth, Bobby Jindal's weirdly robotic delivery (think Kenneth from \"30 Rock\"), or Steve Beshear's declaration he was \"a proud Republican, and Democrat, and mostly American.\"   Yet done right, Joe Kennedy has the opportunity to reach into the living rooms of millions of Americans to point out the holes in the State of the Union and the faults in the president's vision for the future and to show viewers that it's the Democratic Party that has their interests in mind. It's the starting gun for the 2018 races and should preview the foundational arguments we'll be hearing on the campaign trail this year.   And that is certainly worth watching tomorrow night.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Jeff Sessions was in his office, looking unusually deflated. He had just received another public lashing from President Donald Trump. Trump had browbeaten his attorney general for months after Sessions' decision to step aside from the intensifying Russia investigation. Never mind that Sessions has proved fiercely devoted to his boss, carrying out Trump's agenda while giving him credit every step of the way. Trump was unforgiving. This attack came on an autumn day, and Sessions discussed it with a longtime friend and adviser who had stopped by to chat. Sessions shrugged. \"I do the best I can,\" he said. Then he got back to work. And, somewhat surprisingly, he's still working. Sessions will soon mark his first year on the job, having survived a barrage of insults from Trump, antipathy from some Justice Department employees and even calls from some fellow Republicans for him to resign. Last week, America's top law enforcement officer was himself questioned as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible obstruction of justice and Trump campaign ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump's relentless attacks have been a wearing distraction, say friends and associates of the former Alabama senator. The Associated Press interviewed more than a dozen of them, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private interactions. What keeps him going, friends say, is his Methodist faith, support from his wife and his awareness that, at age 71, leading the Justice Department is his best and perhaps final chance to carry out the policy changes he long has sought. Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump's candidacy, declined to be interviewed for this story but did agree to respond to written questions. He did not directly address his personal relationship with Trump but said his first year was marked by progress on a number of Trump's priorities: fighting crime, combating gangs and helping police. \"We are doing what the people sent us here to do,\" he said. While Sessions is proud of his first year, friends see signs of stress. At an annual Justice Department Christmas party, one friend noted, the usually upbeat attorney general looked sullen and tired. \"We have talked about some of the difficult times he's had since he has been attorney general,\" said the Senate's second-ranking Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, a Sessions' confidant. \"My comment to him was, as long as you're doing the right thing, I don't think you have anything to apologize for.\" What Sessions sees as doing the right thing, though, often appears to others as doing Trump's bidding. Critics say Sessions is too loyal, dangerously politicizing his department in an effort to appease Trump. Sessions told senior prosecutors to look into Hillary Clinton's activities after Trump demanded investigations of his 2016 Democratic rival, and he has been eager to pursue investigations into Trump grievances, such as media leaks. Lawmakers accuse Sessions of stonewalling congressional committees investigating the Trump campaign by repeatedly saying he doesn't recall key events. Some say Sessions' public silence in the face of Trump's assaults on the department is demoralizing to employees and threatens its independence from the White House. Sessions said Friday that it's the department's responsibility to identify past mistakes and that a \"culture of defensiveness is not acceptable.\" \"It seems he recognizes he is in such a weakened position, if he wants to stay in Trump's good graces he has to at least make a show of responding to Trump's demands, and that's extremely dangerous,\" said William Yeomans, who spent nearly 30 years at the department under Democratic and Republican administrations. One example that raised eyebrows: Sessions' plan to confront the opioid crisis hews so closely to Trump's that White House aide Kellyanne Conway was on hand in the Justice Department's seventh-floor conference room when he announced it. Sessions declined to address specific actions by his department but said it carries out \"the law without regard to the political consequences or to poll numbers or who benefits and who doesn't,\" and Trump supports that. Even if Sessions is complying with Trump's demands and pursuing his agenda, the attorney general has yet to find himself back in favor with the president. Before Sessions' decision to withdraw from the Russia investigation, Trump used to call Sessions periodically and seek his counsel. Now the two men rarely speak, and Sessions at times has resorted to asking West Wing aides to pass messages to Trump. The rupture stems from Sessions' move on March 2 to step aside from that investigation after acknowledging he had had two previously undisclosed encounters with the Russian ambassador in Washington during Trump's campaign. Sessions said it would be improper for him to oversee an investigation into a campaign in which he played a prominent role. Trump was furious. Sessions had disregarded a plea from Trump's White House lawyer, Don McGahn, who, at Trump's request, had urged the attorney general to retain oversight of the investigation. But by then, Sessions had already consulted with ethics officials and had made up his mind. Sessions' action left Trump without a close political appointee keeping a hand in the investigation of his campaign, Sessions offered to resign. Trump declined to accept it. Sacking Sessions would have been politically perilous for the president. But the barrage of tweets and public and private comments from Trump haven't ended. He disparaged Sessions in comparisons with Eric Holder, whom Trump says he respects for protecting President Barack Obama while serving as attorney general. Sessions has endured with a courtly stoicism. If he's frustrated, friends said, he mostly keeps it to himself. At a recent get-together with Terry Lathan, a friend and chairwoman of the Alabama Republican Party, Sessions seemed more interested in what was going on back home than in complaining about job pressures. \"He's not going to sit around and yank the president's tie in private conversation with a group of his buddies,\" said Ken Blackwell, a domestic policy adviser to Trump's transition team who has known Sessions for years. \"He's more like, this is what we need to get done, how do we get it done?\" Trump's antagonism has distressed Sessions' friends and supporters because they don't believe Sessions' stepping aside from the Russia investigation was a close call. One Sessions' ally said the attorney general's attitude remains that he is going to work 18-hour days to promote the administration's agenda. Trump's priorities reflect the interests Sessions long has advocated, first as a federal prosecutor and then as a senator: illegal immigration, violent crime, illegal drugs, defending the rights of those who say they've been discriminated against based on religion. \"President Trump knows how to give clear orders, and he told us to reduce crime, take on the gangs and cartels, and back the men and women in blue,\" Sessions said. \"The good news for us is that these directives are exactly what I want to do.\" That agenda has unsettled liberals who say Sessions' focus on tough prosecutions marks a return to failed tactics that unduly hurt minorities and the poor. They say his rollbacks of protections for gay and transgender people amount to discrimination. For Sessions, there's satisfaction in being able to reverse Obama-era policies that he and other conservatives say flouted the will of Congress. \"The progress he has made has been very gratifying to him,\" said former Attorney General Ed Meese, who sees Sessions periodically. Sessions takes pride in his many visits to U.S. attorney offices, where he speaks with local authorities, some of his most ardent fans, about how the federal government can help them. During a particularly tense stretch in November, when Sessions faced attacks from Trump and members of Congress, department officials held a call urging law enforcement groups to be vocally supportive of him, a person familiar with the call said. Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs' Association, recalled a December meeting when Sessions said he had to cut his appearance short. His voice was hoarse and he lamented his full schedule. \"He said, 'I wish I could sit here and talk with you all day,'\" before his staff moved him along, said Thompson.",

            "article_content": "LONDON --\u00a0President Trump had a wide-ranging interview with journalist Piers Morgan on ITV Sunday night where he revealed that he tweets in bed and how he would have taken a \"tougher\" attitude toward Brexit negotiations than the approach now being used by British Prime Minister Theresa May. Without providing specifics, Mr. Trump says he would have used different tactics. \"Would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn't negotiate it the way it's (being) negotiated ... I would have had a different attitude,\" he says. He says: \"I would have said that the European Union is not cracked up to what it's supposed to be.\" Mr. Trump also mentioned Sunday that he would make a trade deal with the United Kingdom. Britain is preparing to leave the European Union in March 2019. The complex negotiations have moved slowly and May's Cabinet seems deeply divided over how best to separate Britain from the 28-nation bloc. In the interview, Mr. Trump said he looks forward to visiting Britain, where he has been invited for a state visit to be hosted by Queen Elizabeth II. During the interview, Mr. Trump was social media is a way to defend himself in an era of \"fake news\" and that he sometimes tweets from bed. \"Well perhaps sometimes in bed, perhaps sometimes at breakfast or lunch or  whatver, but generally speak during the early morning, or the evening...I am very busy during the day.\" He also said he was willing to apologize for retweeting anti-Muslim videos by a far-right group in Britain, which exacerbated tensions with May and drew complaints in Parliament.              Discussing the upcoming royal wedding that will feature an American bride, he says Britain's Prince Harry and actress Meghan Markle, look like a \"lovely couple\" and says he doesn't know if he's been invited to their May 19 nuptials. Told that Markle backed Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and has described Trump as \"divisive,\" the president struck a friendly note: \"Well, I still hope they're happy,\" he says. Mr. Trump also says that his administration might not withdraw from the Paris climate accord if terms more favorable to the United States are reached, in part because he likes French President Emmanuel Macron. \"No I like him, he's a friend of mine, Emmanuel! He's a great guy, his wife is fantastic I like him a lot,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We had dinner at the top of the Eiffel Tower.\" Mr. Trump also mentioned that he would re-enter the Paris Climate Accord, but it has to be a good deal for the United States. The interview was conducted Thursday during Mr. Trump's brief visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. When Mr. Trump was asked about criticism from some women, he said he supported women and that many women understood that. He also mentioned that they like his support for a strong military as they often wanted to feel safe at home. Mr. Trump also said he had tremendous respect for women, but when pressed further, said he was not a feminist. The guest list for Harry and Markle's May 19 wedding at Windsor Castle has not been made public. The prince's press team said invitations have not been sent out yet. It is not clear if a final list has been drawn up. The British press has been filled with speculation that Harry and Markle might snub Mr. Trump and invite former U.S. President Barack Obama as a wedding guest. The prince and Mr. Obama have met on several occasions, and Mr. Obama gave Harry a rare interview last year that was broadcast on the BBC. Mr. Trump, in contrast, has angered many people in Britain with his crackdown on immigration and his climate change policies. During the interview, he seemed open to revisiting his pledge to withdraw from 2015 Paris climate accord if the deal could be substantially revised. Under the pact, nations set their own goals to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases. Because of legal technicalities America can't get out until November of 2020. \"If somebody said, go back into the Paris accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal,\" Mr. Trump says. \"Would I go back in? Yeah, I'd go back in. I like, as you know, I like Emmanuel (Macron). I would love to, but it's got to be a good deal for the United States.\" Mr. Trump said the climate has been cooling as well as warming and asserted that ice caps have not been shrinking as predicted. \"The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they're setting records,\" he said. However, those remarks don't quite match what data shows and scientists say. The world hasn't been cooling except for normal day-to-day weather variations; it has been just the opposite. And there have been far more records for shrinking ice on the top and the bottom of the world than growing, despite what the president claimed.",

            "article_content": "President Trump is claiming he would take a \"tougher\" attitude toward Brexit negotiations with the European Union than the approach now being used by British Prime Minister Theresa May.  Without providing specifics, Mr. Trump says in an ITV interview to be broadcast Sunday night that he would have used different tactics.  \"Would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn't negotiate it the way it's (being) negotiated... I would have had a different attitude,\" he said. \"I would have said that the European Union is not cracked up to what it's supposed to be.\"  Britain is preparing to leave 28-nation bloc in March 2019. The complex negotiations have moved slowly and May's Cabinet seems deeply divided over how best to separate.   In the interview with Piers Morgan, Mr. Trump says he looks forward to visiting Britain -- where he has been invited sometime for a state visit to be hosted by Queen Elizabeth II -- and apologizes for retweeting videos by a far-right group in Britain, which exacerbated tensions with May and drew complaints in Parliament. He also said Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle look like a \"lovely couple\" but he doesn't know if he's been invited to their May 19 nuptials at Windsor Castle. Mr. Trump was unperturbed when told that Markle backed his rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 U.S. election and has described him as \"divisive.\"   \"Well, I still hope they're happy,\" he says.   Mr. Trump also says his administration might not withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate accord if terms more favorable to the United States are reached, in part because he likes French President Emmanuel Macron, a driving force behind implementing the accord.

            "article_content": "LAS VEGAS\u00a0\u2014 Thousands of people poured into a football stadium in Las Vegas on Sunday, the anniversary of women's marches around the world, to cap off a weekend of global demonstrations that participants hope will continue building momentum for equality, justice and an end to sexual harassment. \"This is a birthday party for a movement that has only begun to flex its power to change this democracy,\" Anna Galland, the executive director of the progressive group moveon.org, told the boisterous crowd. Following marches that drew huge crowds across the U.S. on Saturday, one year after President Donald Trump's inauguration, protesters gathered Sunday on multiple continents, including in London, Paris, Sydney, Madrid and Buenos Aires. The events culminated with the Las Vegas rally, which launched an effort to register 1 million voters and target swing states such as Nevada in the U.S. midterm elections later this year, which could shift control of Congress. Organizers said they are planning future events in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas. Paula Beaty, 53, a tech worker from Durham, North Carolina, attended the Las Vegas rally wearing an outfit recalling the women's suffrage movement of the early 20th century. She cited the difference women made in helping Democrat Doug Jones upset conservative Republican Roy Moore for a Senate seat in Alabama in December. Protesters gathered in Paris Sunday near the Eiffel Tower to rally against sexual misconduct and discrimination against women, in solidarity with marchers in the U.S. and elsewhere marking one year of protest against Donald Trump's presidency. (Jan. 21) \"For us it's all about women's rights and we're seeing them be eroded with Trump in office,\" Beaty said. \"The women made a difference in Alabama and we're hoping we can flip the House and Senate with the power of women.\" There was also a push for women to not just register as voters, but as candidates. Democratic Idaho state Rep. Paulette Jordan, a member of the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, drew an immense cheer when she told the crowd she was running to be not only Idaho's first female governor, but the first Native American woman to be governor in any state. She implored other women to join her in running for office. \"This is Idaho's future. This is the future of America,\" she said. The demonstrations came at a time of reckoning for many men in Hollywood, the media and other industries as women speak out about sexual misconduct and inequity in general. Among the speakers in Las Vegas was singer and actress Cher. \"This is one of the worst times in our history and that's why I honestly believe that women are going to be the ones that fix it,\" Cher told the crowd. \"Stay strong and remember if you don't have a vote, you don't have a voice.\" Those who took part in this year's events said they were galvanized by an avalanche of political and gender issues over the past year, as well as the #MeToo movement, which has been credited with countering widespread sexual abuse and misconduct. Many of the marchers not only supported women's rights, but also denounced Trump's views on issues including immigration, abortion and LGBT rights. Demonstrators denounced Trump's views with colorful signs and even saltier language. Trump dismissed the suggestion that his presidency has been bad for women. He tweeted Saturday that it was a \"perfect day\" for women to march to celebrate the \"economic success and wealth creation\" of his first year in office. \"Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months,\" the Republican wrote. \"Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!\" In Palm Beach, Florida, home to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, several hundred people marched Saturday carrying anti-Trump signs. A group of women wearing red cloaks and white hats like the characters in the book and television versions of \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" which imagines a future in which women's rights have been strictly limited, walked in formation with their heads bowed. In the British capital Sunday, demonstrators carried placards reading \"We Are Powerful\" and \"Time's Up\" and chanted outside Prime Minister Theresa May's office as they raised grievances ranging from workplace inequities to misogynistic abuse on social media. \"Today is a call for action to bring about change,\" London protest co-organizer Shola Mos-Shogbamimu said. \"This is so much more than Trump.'\" The London event drew thousands of people despite sleet and snow. Heavy rain fell on Paris protesters who gathered near the Eiffel Tower, which could have been a factor in the small number of participants compared to the U.S. marches on Saturday. \"It doesn't matter if the weather is like this,\" Maggie Kim, who was one of the more than 100 people who didn't let the rain and cold deter them. \"We're still coming together, and we're going to still fight against Trump and his agenda.\"",

            "article_content": "Regardless of the outcome, the \"Great Government Shutdown of 2018\" will go down as a win for President Trump. Why? Because it's yet another \"why the hell not\" moment from Washington, D.C. During the 2016 primaries I was a radio talk host in Atlanta, Georgia\u2014a conservative host on a conservative station in a conservative state.\u00a0 I was surprised by the amount of support a big-city, liberal-leaning TV star like Donald Trump had among people I knew were traditional conservatives who in the past would never support someone with Trump's (ahem) \"troubling\" background. One of them, a lifelong Republican who by his own admission \"would be a Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio man\" explained his support for Trump over the rest of the GOP field by listing a litany of letdowns from the Republican party (immigration, foreign interventions) and instances of gross incompetence by the government in general\u2014\"they can't pay the bills, can't balance the budget, can't fix Obamacare,\" and so on. \"How can it get worse?\" he asked rhetorically. \"So, sure, I'm voting for Trump. Why the hell not?\" The president's opponents believe that his first year is the answer to the question \"Why not?\" Look at the government shutdown, they say. When Eric Trump said over the weekend that the shutdown was \"good for us,\" he was right, though not in the partisan sense he intended. They're not good for Republicans, but they are good for \"drain the swamp\" outsiders like Eric's dad. As CBS News noted, \"Government shutdowns are unusual, but they're not unheard of.\"\u00a0 Congress shut down the government for almost two weeks in 2013\u2014part of an astonishing string of budget battles that involved the Democratic-controlled Senate simply refusing to pass a budget for four years\u2014even in 2009-10 when Democrats had total control of Congress. In 2012, Harry Reid's Senate voted down President Obama's budget proposal 97-0(!) The most basic task of Congress is collecting taxes and funding the government, and it's been an unseemly mess for at least a decade. So while Republicans shout about the #SchumerShutdown and Democrats taunt the GOP with #TrumpShutdown, to many Americans it looks like the same old story: In a city where partisanship is more important than leadership, Democrats and Republicans can't make Washington work. And the people may be onto something.\u00a0 According to the \"Vote View\" project founded by Carnegie-Mellon University, party-line voting by members of Congress is at the highest level in more than a century. It's hard to believe, but as recently as the 1970s, members of Congress only voted with their party an average of 60 percent of the time. Today that number is 90 percent. And so, for example, even after the hyper-partisan controversy of the \"hanging chad\" 2000 election, President George W. Bush's 2001 tax plan received a bipartisan 58-33 vote in the senate thanks to the support of 12 Democrats (and opposition of GOP Sen. John McCain.)\u00a0 Sixteen years later, the GOP's tax cut failed to receive a single Democratic vote in the House or Senate. There's an easy case to make for the argument that Trump makes it harder for Democrats to cross the aisle and support him.\u00a0 Attacking \"Dicky Durbin\" and \"Cryin' Chuck Schumer\" is hardly a smart strategy for getting the two highest-ranking Senate Democrats to cooperate. However, as the VoteView website notes, \"Donald Trump will be the third consecutive President who is widely disliked by members of the opposite Party.\" Yes, our political polarization is worse than it's ever been. But it's been bad for years and showed no signs of improving no matter which candidate won the White House in 2016. So why not cast a \"Why the hell not?\" ballot. Americans in general\u2014and the blue-collar voters in Rust Belt states who voted Obama in 2008 and Trump in 2016 in particular--have a credible case that their confidence in the system and its two parties was misplaced.\u00a0 They voted for change in 2008. The one major change, Obamacare, was unpopular (its polls were underwater the entire Obama presidency) and poorly implemented.\u00a0 Voters voted for change again in 2010 and again in 2014, but generally got more of the same. So why not cast a vote against the system itself by voting for a candidate completely outside it?\u00a0 And if you did cast a vote against the insider politics and general incompetence of Washington's political class, doesn't yet another government shutdown\u2014particularly one as seemingly unnecessary as this one\u2014prove your point? \u00a0 Yes, Trump opponents can argue that any failure on his watch is a Trump failure. And Trump's own confusing tweets and self-contradictory messaging made a shutdown more likely in the waning days. But the meta-message of the Trump movement is that Washington just doesn't work, that the swamp needs to be drained, that both parties are more interested in politics than people. And every congressional failure, from the Obamacare repeal fiasco to the #DACA shutdown, feeds that overarching message. During the 2016 campaign, every time it appeared Trump's campaign fortunes were about to collapse, he was able to turn the conversation to the Washington political class and his argument that they weren't getting the job done for the American people.\u00a0 It would be just enough to keep him in the race and eventually win an Electoral College victory. Government shutdowns are just the sort of \"more of the same\" \"why the hell not\" moments that a politician like Donald Trump needs to stay in the game.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- More demonstrations in support of female empowerment are planned around the world Sunday, a day after a host of marches and protests, several of them massive, marked the anniversary of President Trump's inauguration.\u00a0  Marches are scheduled in cities including Miami, Melbourne and Munich. A rally in Las Vegas will launch an effort to register 1 million voters and target swing states in the midterm elections. On Saturday, many not only supported women's rights, but also denounced Mr. Trump's views on issues including immigration, abortion and LGBT rights. The 2017 rally in Washington, D.C., and hundreds of similar marches, created solidarity for those opposing Mr. Trump's views, words and actions. Millions of people around the world marched during last year's rallies. Participants on Saturday talked about the news avalanche of politics and gender issues in the past year. They said they were galvanized by the #MeToo movement, which has been credited as countering widespread sexual abuse and misconduct. Critics of the weekend's marches said the demonstrations were really a protest against Mr. Trump. The president tweeted Saturday that it was a \"perfect day\" for women to march to celebrate the \"economic success and wealth creation\" that's happened during his first year in office. Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years! Demonstrators on Saturday denounced Mr. Trump's views with colorful signs and even saltier language. Oklahoma City protesters chanted \"We need a leader, not a creepy tweeter!\" One woman donned a T-shirt with the likeness of social justice icon Woody Guthrie, who wrote \"This Land Is Your Land.\" Members of the group Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women of Seattle burned sage and chanted in front of Seattle's rainy march. In Richmond, Virginia, the crowd burst into cheers when a woman ran down the middle of the street carrying a pink flag with the word \"Resist.\" The march in Washington, D.C., on Saturday took on the feel of a political rally when U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, both Democrats, urged women to run for office and vote to oppose Mr. Trump and the Republicans' agenda. \"We march, we run, we vote, we win,\" Pelosi said, to applause. People gathered from Montpelier to Milwaukee, from Shreveport to Seneca Falls. \"I think right now with the #MeToo movement, it's even more important to stand for our rights,\" said Karen Tordivo, who marched in Cleveland with her husband and 6-year-old daughter. In Palm Beach, Florida, home to Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, several hundred people gathered carrying anti-Trump signs before marching. A group of women wearing red cloaks and white hats like the characters in the book and TV show \"The Handmaid's Tale\" marched in formation, their heads bowed. Cathy Muldoon, a high school librarian from Dallas, Pennsylvania, took her two teenage daughters to the New York rally and said marching gives people hope. She said this year's action is set against the backdrop of the Trump presidency, which \"turned out to be as scary as we thought it would be.\" \"I've not seen any checks and balances,\" she said. \"Everything is moving toward the right, and we have a president who seems to have no decency.\" In Los Angeles, Eva Longoria, Natalie Portman, Viola Davis, Alfre Woodard, Scarlett Johansson, Constance Wu, Adam Scott and Rob Reiner were among the celebrities who addressed a crowd of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators at a women's march. Longoria, who starred in TV's \"Desperate Housewives,\" told marchers their presence matters, \"especially when those in power seem to have turned their backs on reason and justice.\" Portman, an Academy Award winner, talked about feeling sexualized by the entertainment industry from the time her first film, \"Leon: The Professional,\" was released when she was 13 and suggested it's time for \"a revolution of desire.\" In the 1994 film, Portman played a young girl taken in by a hit man after her family is killed. Woodard urged everyone to register and vote, saying, \"the 2018 midterms start now,\" echoing many speakers at marches across the country, who urged women to vote. ",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON --\u00a0The federal government stopped operating at midnight, halting all but essential services, after the Senate came 10 votes short of reaching a temporary, last-minute funding deal that would have kept the government open through February 16. The shutdown comes on the anniversary of President Trump's inauguration, and with the GOP in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House. Mr. Trump is placing blame on Senate Democrats. However, five Democrats broke with their party to back the measure, while five Republicans voted against it. Democrats were holding out for a comprehensive bill and a deal to protect DACA recipients \u2013 immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. If Republican leaders get their way, the shutdown will not last long, CBS News' Nancy Cordes reported. They were hoping that Democrats would join them later Saturday in passing a bill to keep the government open for 2.5 weeks. The Senate adjourned early Saturday and reconvened at noon.\u00a0 But longer the shutdown continues, the more likely its impact will be felt.\u00a0 U.S. troops will stay at their posts and mail will get delivered, but almost half of the 2 million civilian federal workers will be barred from doing their jobs if the shutdown extends into Monday.  Here is how key parts of the federal government would be affected by a shutdown:  A shutdown plan posted on the Treasury Department's website shows that nearly 44 percent of the IRS' 80,565 employees will be exempt from being furloughed during a shutdown. That would mean nearly 45,500 IRS employees will be sent home just as the agency is preparing for the start of the tax filing season and ingesting the sweeping changes made by the new GOP tax law.\u00a0 The Republican architects of the tax law have promised that millions of working Americans will see heftier paychecks next month, with less money withheld by employers in anticipation of lower income taxes. The IRS recently issued new withholding tables for employers.  But Marcus Owens, who for 10 years headed the IRS division dealing with charities and political organizations, said it's a \"virtual certainty\" that the larger paychecks will be delayed if there's a lengthy government shutdown.  Half of the more than 80,000 employees will be sent home. Key programs will continue to function because their funding has ongoing authorization and doesn't depend on annual approval by Congress. But critical disruptions could occur across the vast jurisdiction of HHS programs -- including the seasonal flu program.\u00a0 Medicare, which insures nearly 59 million seniors and disabled people, will keep going. And so will Medicaid, which covers more than 74 million low-income and disabled people, including most nursing home residents.  States will continue to receive payments for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers about 9 million kids. However, long-term funding for the program will run out soon unless Congress acts to renew it.  Deep into a tough flu season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be unable to support the government's annual seasonal flu program. And CDC's ability to respond to disease outbreaks will be significantly reduced.  Many of the nearly 115,000 Justice Department employees have national security and public safety responsibilities that allow them to keep working during a shutdown. Special counsel Robert Mueller's team investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election will also continue working. His office is paid for indefinitely.\u00a0 The more than 95,000 employees who are \"exempted\" include most of the members of the national security division, U.S. attorneys, and most of the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, U.S. Marshals Service and federal prison employees. Criminal cases will continue, but civil cases will be postponed as long as doing so doesn't compromise public safety. Most law enforcement training will be canceled, per the department's contingency plan.  Many State Department operations will continue in a shutdown. Passport and visa processing, which are largely self-funded by consumer fees, will not shut down. The agency's main headquarters in Washington, in consultation with the nearly 300 embassies, consulates and other diplomatic missions around the world, will draw up lists of nonessential employees who will be furloughed.\u00a0 Department operations will continue through the weekend and staffers will be instructed to report for work as usual on Monday to find out whether they have been furloughed.  The U.S. military will continue to fight wars and conduct missions around the world, including in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. And members of the military will report to work, though they won't get paid until Congress approves funding.\u00a0 \"The military will still go to work,\" said Mick Mulvaney, Office of Management and Budget director. \"They will not get paid.\"  \"The border will still be patrolled, they will not get paid,\" said Mulvaney. \"Fire folks will still be fighting the fires out West, they will not get paid.\" But Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warned Friday that a shutdown will have far-reaching effects.\u00a0 \"Our maintenance activities will probably pretty much shut down,\" he said during remarks at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \"We do a lot of intelligence operations around the world, and they cost money. Those, obviously, would stop. And I would just tell you that training for almost our entire reserve force will stop.\"  And, while ships will remain at sea and airstrikes against enemy fighters will continue, any National Guard forces heading out to do weekend training duty around the country will arrive at armories and be told to go home.  The workforce at the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies will be pared down significantly, according to a person familiar with contingency procedures. The official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity, said employees who are considered essential and have to work will do so with no expectation of a regular paycheck.\u00a0 While they can be kept on the job, federal workers can't be paid for days worked during a shutdown. In the past, however, they have been paid retroactively even if they were ordered to stay home.  A department spokesman said nearly 90 percent of Homeland Security employees are considered essential and will continue to perform their duties during a government shutdown. That means most Customs and Border Protection and Transportation Security Administration workers will stay on the job, according to the department's shutdown plan, dated Friday.\u00a0 Immigration and Customs Enforcement will be staffed at about 78 percent, meaning more than 15,000 of the agency's employees will keep working. The Secret Service, also part of Homeland Security, will retain more than 5,700 employees during the shutdown.  The Interior Department says national parks and other public lands will remain as accessible as possible. That position is a change from previous shutdowns, when most parks were closed and became high-profile symbols of dysfunction.\u00a0 Spokeswoman Heather Swift said the American public -- especially veterans who come to the nation's capital -- should find war memorials and open-air parks available to visitors. Swift said many national parks and wildlife refuges nationwide will also be open with limited access when possible.  She said public roads that already are open are likely to remain open, though services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds, full-service restrooms and concessions won't be operating. Backcountry lands and culturally sensitive sites are likely to be restricted or closed, she said.  More than half -- 34,600 -- of the Department of Transportation's 55,100 employees will continue working during a shutdown. The bulk of those staying on the job work for the Federal Aviation Administration, which operates the nation's air traffic control system.  Controllers and aviation, pipeline and railroad safety inspectors are among those who would continue to work. But certification of new aircraft will be limited, and processing of airport construction grants, training of new controllers, registration of planes, air traffic control modernization research and development, and issuance of new pilot licenses and medical certificates will stop.  At the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, investigations on auto safety defects will be suspended, incoming information on possible defects from manufacturers and consumers won't be reviewed and compliance testing of vehicles and equipment will be delayed.  The Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, whose operations are mostly paid for out of the Federal Highway Trust Fund, will continue most of their functions. The fund's revenue comes from federal gas and diesel taxes, which will continue to be collected. But work on issuing new regulations will stop throughout the department and its nine agencies.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the agency's infectious disease chief, said a government shutdown will be disruptive to research and morale at the National Institutes of Health but will not adversely affect patients already in medical studies.\u00a0 \"We still take care of them,\" he said of current NIH patients. But other types of research would be seriously harmed, Fauci said.  A shutdown could mean interrupting research that's been going on for years, Fauci said. The NIH is the government's primary agency responsible for biomedical and public health research across 27 institutes and centers. Its research ranges from cancer studies to the testing and creation of vaccines.  \"You can't push the pause button on an experiment,\" he said.  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has instructed workers there to come to work next week even with a shutdown. Pruitt said in an email to all EPA employees on Friday that the agency had \"sufficient resources to remain open for a limited amount of time.\" He said further instructions would come if the shutdown lasts for more than a week.\u00a0 The instructions from Pruitt are different from how the agency has operated during prior shutdowns and the contingency plan posted on EPA's website. A spokesman for the agency said earlier on Friday that the December 2017 plan was no longer valid.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump took to Twitter Saturday morning to blame Democrats for the government shutdown that began hours earlier, after Senate Republicans failed to capture enough votes to move toward a short-term funding bill. A vote late Friday night that would have prompted a vote on a continuing resolution, or CR, to fund the government for 30 days fell far short of 60 votes, and senators could not devise a plan in the eleventh hour to stop a shutdown.\u00a0 Mr. Trump blamed Democrats, who are the minority in the Senate, saying they care more about illegal immigration than the military. Democrats wanted a solution to fix the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program Mr. Trump is ending, something Republicans did not agree to as a part of negotiations.\u00a0 Given that the GOP only has 50 senators, and the measures Friday required 60 votes, Mr. Trump made the case for the need for more Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections.\u00a0 The president began tweeting at 6:17 a.m. Saturday, six hours after the government shut down. Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess! For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on  Crime (and Border), and even better to our Military & Veterans! Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can\u2019t let that happen! Mr. Trump also said: \"This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present.\" Mr. Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20 last year. He was scheduled to attend a party celebrating that anniversary at his club Mar-a-Lago in Florida Saturday, but his trip was postponed indefinitely in light of the shutdown.\u00a0 This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown In May, the president suggested the country \"needs a good shutdown,\" comments that resurfaced Friday night.\u00a0 either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good \"shutdown\" in September to fix mess! Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "As President Donald Trump on Saturday reaches the one-year mark since his inauguration, the U.S. economy is booming. To hear him tell it, this is the happy result of his policies. But while his tax cuts will likely have a beneficial outcome, at least for businesses' bottom lines, the impact of Trumponomics in other areas is problematic. Beyond that is the question of the White House's power to direct a vast and complex $18.6 trillion national economy. Presidents have long taken credit for good economic times, and Mr. Trump is no exception. \"American business is hot again!\" the president tweeted last weekend.\u00a0 To Democrats, who say the economy's rise since the Great Recession occurred mostly on Barack Obama's watch, this is baloney. David Axelrod, a former Obama adviser and now director of the University of Chicago's Institute on Politics, countered that Mr. Trump is a \"very loud rooster taking credit for the dawn.\"\u00a0 History shows that presidents have a limited impact\u00a0on the economy's performance, since broader trends like interest rates and consumer spending aren't theirs to command. Still, fiscal policy -- namely what Washington spends and how -- and other executive actions do influence the economy's course.\u00a0 \"It's early for Trump's policies to effect economic change,\" said John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial. \"But there's good mojo.\" Yesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming back to the USA, from Mexico and many others will follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. American business is hot again! Some 67 percent of Americans say the economy is in fair or very good shape, and 71 percent believe that is partially or mostly because of Mr. Trump's policies, according to a CBS News Poll released Thursday (see charts at bottom). Even half of the Democrats surveyed give him some credit. At the same time, only 22 percent think they have been directly helped by Trump policies. This comes amid historically low and highly partisan approval ratings, with just 37 percent approving of the job he is doing as president. Here's how America's economy looks after one year of President Trump: The respectable\u00a0increase in GDP\u00a0during the Trump administration's initial year seems to support the narrative that the economy is once more on the march. The first quarter of 2017, when Mr. Trump took office, posted subpar 1.2 percent annualized gain. But the second and third quarters, with the Trump team fully in charge, showed substantial acceleration, with growth of 3.1 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively. And many GDP forecasts for 2018 project similar or even faster growth.\u00a0 Regardless of who deserves credit, this is welcome news. Since the recession, which ended in Mr. Obama's first year as president, GDP growth averaged around 2 percent annually, an anemic pace historically. Rebounds from major downturns tend to be more robust.\u00a0 There are many explanations for this, such as shell shock from the financial crisis keeping business and consumers wary. In fairness, the Obama expansion record also had its buoyant moments. Example: After GDP of minus 1 percent in the first quarter of 2014, growth leaped to around 5 percent in the second and third. But then it slowed to just a 2 percent advance in the fourth.\u00a0 Today, the so-called animal spirits -- legendary economist John Maynard Keynes' term for widespread optimism that leads to investing and other upbeat economic activity -- are back. Consumer confidence is high, consumer spending is solid, capital expenditures (companies' outlays for plants, equipment and kindred steps to enlarge their operations) are once more climbing, and after years in the doldrums, wages show signs of picking up. Pay rose at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in December, and research firm Oxford Economics believes this could go up a full percentage point higher by year-end.\u00a0 While these glad tidings can be chalked up to an expected, if belated, recovery from the recession, the Trump tax cuts appear to be a factor in boosting confidence, particularly among businesses. The tax bill, which Mr. Trump signed right before Christmas, slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, making the U.S. more competitive with other major economies, and allowed the immediate write-off of capital spending, instead of spreading it over several years -- all boons to corporate profits.\u00a0 The tax plan aims to pump $1.5 trillion worth of breaks into the nation's economy over the next 10 years. Although the bulk of the benefits go to companies and the wealthy, ordinary folks will get something, too. The average tax reduction for the middle fifth of American taxpayers by income will be $800 in 2019 and $55,000 for the richest 1 percent, estimates from the\u00a0Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy\u00a0contend. \u00a0\"The extra income is bound to help them in the short run,\" said David Swenson, an Iowa State economist. By Oxford Economics' projections, this stimulus should add 0.4 percentage points to GDP growth in 2018. During President Obama's first year, 2009, the recession-racked unemployment rate continued to climb until it peaked at 10 percent in October. By the time he handed the Oval Office over to Mr. Trump last January, joblessness had fallen to 4.8 percent, and during the first Trump year it dropped to 4.1 percent. In 2017, the economy added 2 million jobs. Some economists think the unemployment rate will dip further this year, to as low as 3.5 percent.\u00a0 So right now, the country is in a blessed situation called \"full employment,\" in which workers are in demand -- perhaps one reason wages at last have begun to nudge up.\u00a0 As a candidate and as president, Mr. Trump has pledged to restore the nation's manufacturing base, which technology and cheap overseas labor competition have eroded. At the end of World War II, a quarter of American jobs were in factories. Today, it's around 9 percent. Numerically, manufacturing jobs topped out at 19.4 million in 1979 and dipped to a recession low of 11.5 million in 2009. It has been crawling back ever since.\u00a0In December, manufacturing employment\u00a0rose by 25,000, mostly due to a gain in durable goods industries. The factory sector generated 196,000 new jobs in 2017. Whether Mr. Trump is the catalyst for this latest increase or merely its heralding rooster, he has made a point of badgering U.S. companies to stop exporting jobs to lower-cost locales like Mexico. Just prior to taking over, the soon-to-be president pressured air-conditioner maker Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), to keep 1,000 jobs in Indianapolis rather than ship them south of the border. Carrier, however, has still cut several hundred jobs there. Delivering on his job promises will be difficult in other instances as well. Consider coal mining, which Mr. Trump has targeted for a rebound. Despite relaxing regulations on environmental standards, employment in this industry remained stagnant in 2017, at just over 50,000, as utilities continue their ongoing shift to cleaner and cheaper natural gas. That employment figure is down from almost 90,000 in 2011.\u00a0 Meantime, Mr. Trump and GOP lawmakers are mulling cutting the number of legal immigrants, now 1 million yearly, in half. The president believes these immigrants bring crime and terrorism to U.S. shores and swipe American jobs. However, such a draconian approach would harm growth, Simon Johnson, former International Monetary Fund chief economist, argued at a recent public forum. And it means economic goals \"are going to disappear like sand through your fingers,\" he said. Mr. Trump's strident \"America First' rhetoric is far from empty. Among one of his first gambits was to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade pact designed to create a common market. The president complained that it would cost American jobs.\u00a0 The next trade treaty in his gun sights now is the North American Free Trade Agreement, a deal among the U.S., Canada and Mexico signed in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, which mostly eliminates tariffs. Mr. Trump, however, charges that it eases the transfer of U.S. jobs to lower-wage Mexico. Axing NAFTA could lead to higher prices in the U.S. and harm U.S. exporters, especially farmers, critics say. As \u00a0Iowa State's Swenson put it: \"Mexican legislators are saying: 'Why get corn from Iowa when we can go to Argentina?'\" The risk is that Mr. Trump could start a full-scale trade war, with devastating consequences. In the presidential campaign, he vilified China as a currency manipulator and job thief, yet initially as president he made nice with Beijing in hopes of getting its help in ending North Korea's nuclear buildup.\u00a0 That didn't go anywhere, so now Mr. Trump is taking the hard line again. He has griped to Chinese leader Xi Jinping that the U.S. trade deficit with China is \"not sustainable.\" The administration may soon announce tariffs or quotas on Chinese washing machines and solar panels. In the wings are even harsher tactics, like banning Chinese investments in the U.S. Such talk has many fearful of a reprise of the trade disputes that deepened the Great Depression. A less-dire scenario has the rest of the world striking deals and liberalizing trade, while the U.S. languishes on the sidelines. \"The U.S. economy will suffer as others move forward and we stay in the same place,\" warned Simon Lester, a trade analyst with the Cato Institute.\u00a0 Slightly more than half of Americans invest in the stock market, whether through owning individual shares, mutual funds or retirement accounts like 401(k)s. So its fortunes have a bearing on the \"wealth effect,\" the belief among consumers that they are well off, thus encouraging them to spend and invest further, goosing economic growth.\u00a0 Since the 2016 election, domestic stocks and Wall Street's long-running bull market have gotten a new tailwind, with talk of tax cuts, along with deregulation and massive infrastructure spending. The last item has yet to happen. In his eight years, Mr. Obama saw the S&P 500 rise 181 percent, albeit off a low base owing to the recession. During his first year -- the market bottomed out in March 2009, almost two months after his swearing-in -- the S&P climbed 46 percent.\u00a0 By contrast, in Mr. Trump's maiden year, the benchmark stock index was up less, 23 percent, which admittedly was building on a long ascent from the Obama era. The market's \"Trump Bump\" came after moving sideways for 2015 and much of 2016, amid plunging oil prices, which damaged other commodities too, and fears that China's growth was slowing.\u00a0 For this year, continued strong earnings growth is expected. FactSet researchers place it at 14.7 percent, but they project that the S&P 500 will rise 6 percent, less than a third of the 2017 showing. That likely reflects a fatigue after such a heady ascent.\u00a0 Like Ronald Reagan, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama, President Trump must hope that he can cruise through his term without an economic problem. All three of those previous presidents endured recessions at the outset of their tenure, downturns that began under predecessors. And they finished their presidencies amid pleasant economic conditions.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has striven to own the economy as a point of pride. So if it falters -- and the odds are it will at some stage -- he risks looking doubly bad.

Mr. Trump won Iowa by almost 10 percentage points, according to the Des Moines Register. While there were questions about local issues, constituents also focused on the ongoing Russia investigation, immigration and Mr. Trump's recent \"sh*thole\" remark. \"Why have you not interviewed Manafort or Kushner yet,\" asked one constituent, according to CBS affiliate KMTV.\u00a0 Grassley is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is investigating Russian meddling in the election.\u00a0 Another in the crowd wondered why money should go towards a wall instead of local infrastructure. \"The roads are falling apart, the electrical is bad, we need to spend our money on our country and not on a stupid wall.\"\u00a0 Grassley tried to emphasize that a deal on DACA needs to be reached before the March 5th deadline, saying \"we've got to convince the American people that we don't make the same mistakes we did 30 years ago when we thought we had secured the borders because we did away with the magnet of people coming here to work.\" According to KMTV, Grassley said Mr. Trump's \"sh*thole\" remark \"detracts from the very important issue that we got to get solved by March 5th ... it's better to keep to the issues, don't do anything to detract from the issues and bottom line, all people ought to be treated with respect.\" Grassley will be holding another event in Sac City, Iowa, on Saturday morning, according to the Des Moines Register.\u00a0 Last year, angry constitutents stormed members of Congress' town hall meetings.

            "article_content": "New York is often seen as a liberal bastion and a home base for the resistance, but the state that voted for Hillary Clinton by over 20 percentage points has a state Senate controlled by Republicans who have stymied efforts to enact progressive measures for decades. New York has unsuccessfully wrestled with California for the title of most progressive state, and that is largely because of the Republican-controlled state Senate. During Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo's tenure, the state Legislature has passed same-sex marriage and some of the most stringent gun control laws in the country, as well as paid family leave and free tuition for some state university students. Despite these liberal accomplishments, some, like primary challenger Cynthia Nixon, believe that Cuomo has tacitly supported Republican control of the state Senate since his election in 2010. Republicans have held a majority in the Senate since the 1970s, with a brief interregnum in 2009 and 2010 when Democrats briefly gained the majority. However, that grip on power is becoming more tenuous. Numerically, Democrats have a 32 to 31 majority, but a renegade Democrat caucuses with the Republicans, giving them a functional majority. State Sen. Simcha Felder, who made a name for himself by unsuccessfully tackling the scourge of pigeon overpopulation in the New York City Council, is a Democrat in name only. Since joining the state Senate in 2013, Felder has caucused with Republicans, believing that being a member of the majority gives him more leverage to pass his priorities - namely, deregulation of yeshiva schools in his predominantly Orthodox Jewish district. He has not said whether he would rejoin the Democratic conference if they take the majority in November. Felder is not the only Democrat who blocked a Democratic majority. For seven years, a group of breakaway Democrats who called themselves the Independent Democratic Conference caucused separately from mainline Democrats. The more socially conservative IDC often aligned with Republicans in blocking progressive measures which passed the Democratic-majority Assembly, such as making New York a sanctuary state. Cuomo critics in New York suggest he allowed for the power-sharing arrangement between Republicans and the IDC because it allowed him to push his priorities through the legislature, while providing an excuse for why other progressive measures he ostensibly supported would not pass. \"You can't say you're a champion for marriage equality and you're able to push that through with your unique leadership and your ability to sway votes, but not everything else,\" said Nomiki Konst, a progressive activist and New York advisor with Our Revolution, about Cuomo's behavior towards the IDC. Konst is a supporter of Cynthia Nixon, Cuomo's primary opponent. In April, the IDC reconciled with the mainline Democratic conference, in return for the governor's and Senate Democrats' support of IDC members during the primary election. However, several insurgent candidates are running grassroots campaigns against former members, including former IDC leader Jeff Klein. Klein has been accused of sexual misconduct by a former staffer. While former IDC members have cause for concern, if they lose their primaries, their seats will almost certainly remain in Democratic hands. The state Democratic Party is more concerned with targeting vulnerable Republican seats, particularly on Long Island. Long Island has been a Republican stronghold in the state Senate for decades, but there are a few districts held by Republicans that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. One such district is that of state Sen. Elaine Phillips, who is facing a challenge from Anna Kaplan. Kaplan was one of two Democrats in New York endorsed by former President Barack Obama in his first round of midterm endorsements. State Sen. Michael Gianaris, the chair state Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, said that Democrats were looking to capture Republican seats in suburban areas, such as the counties surrounding New York City. He was confident that the predicted \"blue wave\" that could sweep Democrats into control of the House of Representatives nationally could also help Democrats in the New York state Senate. \"If you look around suburban areas, it's where the blue wave is seen the most,\" Gianaris said, referring to recent victories by Democrats around New York. In 2017, Democrat Christine Pellegrino won a special election in a longtime Republican seat on Long Island. Later that year, Democrats took control of the county executive positions in Nassau and Westchester Counties, flipping control of the counties from red to blue. \"Unlike the U.S. Senate map, our map is tremendously in our favor,\" Gianaris said. \"We only have one seat to defend...and [Republicans] have about a dozen on their side, and we only need to pick up one.\" If Democrats take control of the Senate, both houses of the legislature will push to pass progressive priorities. A bill to implement statewide Medicare-for-All has passed the Assembly in previous years, but failed in the Senate. The Reproductive Health Act -- which would codify abortion rights into state law -- has also been stymied by Senate Republicans for years. If Democrats take the majority, both of those bills are extremely likely to pass. A gender non-discrimination act would also likely be approved. New York would also likely brand itself as a sanctuary state for undocumented immigrants, as well as pass the New York DREAM Act for DACA recipients in the state. Cuomo has been knocked for not doing more to pass measures on criminal justice reform and voting reform, even as he has repeatedly included those issues as priorities in state of the state addresses. If Democrats were to win full control of the legislature, they would likely pass measures that would shorten the time between arrest and trial, which would be important for defendants who cannot afford bail. Gianaris is also a sponsor of the Bail Elimination Act in the state Senate, which would end the use of monetary bail. All of these issues are progressive milestones, and would make New York even more of a scapegoat for national Republicans decrying governance by liberals. \"It gives us the opportunity to be a true leader for efforts to push back against the horror show coming out of Washington. We're seeing California doing good things in that respect because they have a Democratic trifecta,\" Gianaris said, referring to the fact that both houses of the California state Legislature and the executive branch are controlled by Democrats. \"They are many steps ahead of us because they've had the ability to enact legislation that we cannot because of the status of the Senate.\" Activists see this liberal vision of New York as an East Coast leader of the resistance as achievable. \"I don't see any reason why they shouldn't be banding together under the leadership of Andrea Stewart-Cousins to push for the most progressive pieces of legislation that have been held up,\" said Konst, referring to the leader of the Democratic conference. If Democrats gain the majority, she will be the first black woman to serve as majority leader of the state Senate. Gianaris seemed hopeful that Democrats would be able to accomplish their goals regardless of whether Cuomo or Nixon were in office, as both candidates \"are in support of a progressive agenda,\" adding that he would hope \"that they would all live up to what they're saying.\" Whether Felder would rejoin the Democratic fold is still an open question. \"I would hope we would put him in the position where it's an easy decision because we're clearly in the majority,\" Gianaris said. \"But I don't want to be in the position where we could be held hostage by people like Simcha Felder, because I would rather have a firm and progressive majority.\" Correction: This story has been updated with Nomiki Konst's current job title.

            "article_content": "The contentious gubernatorial race in Georgia offered voters two choices on the opposite end of the political spectrum: Democratic former Georgia state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, a progressive black woman with a history of political activism, or Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a white man and staunch Trump supporter.\u00a0 The candidates clashed over voting rights -- the biggest fault line in the race has been the suspension of 53,000 voter registrations, 70 percent of which were for black Georgians.\u00a0 Kemp deflected accusations of voter suppression by blaming applicants for making errors and not using online forms to register. \"If they had used the online system, they would not have these problems,\" Kemp said. \"They didn't fill out the form out correctly. The last four digits of Social Security were wrong. Blame President Obama. There are 7 million people who have correctly filled out the form.\" Kemp claimed that voter registration has never been higher in Georgia because of the work he has done. His office has suspended processing the registrations under the auspices of a 2017 state law passed under his urging, which requires an \"exact match\" between a voter registration form and government documents. If a person's voter registration form differs from government documents -- even by a hyphen or a misspelling -- their registration form is considered suspect. While Abrams has claimed Kemp is deliberately trying to suppress the votes of black Georgians, who typically vote Democratic, Kemp argues the issues with registration forms are due to shoddy work by liberal groups such as Abrams' New Georgia Project, which works to register minority voters. However, the 53,000 voters with pending applications can still vote on election day, if they present photo identification at the polls. Kemp, who has been secretary of state since 2010, has promoted several measures during his tenure which Democrats claim are intended to suppress minority votes. Abrams has called on him to step down several times, given that Kemp oversees the state's electoral system. Kemp's office has canceled over 1.4 million voter registrations since 2012, including over 600,000 since 2017 alone, according to the Associated Press. During the debate, Kemp defended staying in his position as secretary of state throughout the election, saying county officials were in charge of the separate boards of election for each county. \"I took an oath of office to serve as secretary of state and that's exactly what I'm going to continue to do,\" he said. During the debate, Kemp also accused Abrams of asking undocumented immigrants to vote for her in November, saying that she had \"called on illegals to vote for you in the election.\" Abrams denied she had done so. \"I know the laws when it comes to voting. I have not asked those who are illegal to cast a ballot,\" she countered. \u00a0 \u00a0 Kemp's allegation comes from a speech to supporters in which Abrams described the upcoming \"blue wave,\" saying that the \"blue wave is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented.\" Abrams has said she did not literally mean illegal immigrants should vote in the election. Kemp repeated during the debate that urging illegal immigrants to vote was \"criminal.\" \"He is someone who is tilting the playing field in his direction and in the direction of his party,\" Abrams said. \"It is absolutely voter suppression.\" Kemp said during the debate he was \"absolutely not\" attempting to suppress any votes, and adding it was a distraction from Abrams' \"extreme\" liberal views such as supporting single-payer health care. \"This farce about voter suppression...is absolutely not true,\" he said. \"She is blaming me for a problem that she created.\" Kemp was the only secretary of state in the country to refuse the Department of Homeland Security's aid against electoral hacking before the 2016 election, and he is being sued for failing to secure the state's voting system and allowing a massive breach into the records of 6 million voters. He and Gwinnett County are also being sued due to the Georgia county's rejection of 595 absentee ballots this year, over half of which belonged to African Americans and Asian Americans. Another issue addressed at the debate on Tuesday was Abrams' activism during college, including her participation in the burning of the former Georgia state flag in 1992. At the time, the flag incorporated the design of the Confederate battle flag. The \"permitted, peaceful protest\" was a part of her opposition to the Confederate symbolism in the flag, campaign spokeswoman Abigail Collazo told CBS News in a statement. In the debate, Abrams said she was \"a very proud Georgian,\" but she opposed the racial symbol in the flag. She also noted Kemp voted to remove the symbol from the flag as a member of the Georgia Senate. Abrams has made the issue of Confederate memorials a key part of her campaign, and has called for the removal of the Confederate carving on Stone Mountain near Atlanta depicting Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. Kemp has said he would protect the monument from the \"radical left.\" The two, as well as libertarian candidate Ted Metz, also sparred over issues such as their health care plans, criminal justice and their personal finances.

            "article_content": "On the eve of the midterm elections, the Justice Department asked the U.S. Supreme Court to bypass three federal appellate courts and allow President Trump to terminate the Obama-era DACA program, which shields hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation.  In court documents filed late Monday, Solicitor General Noel Francisco said the government was petitioning the nation's highest court to hear the case on whether it is lawful for the Trump administration to end DACA. He called the injunctions by three federal circuit courts that prevented the government from killing the initiative \"wrong\" and said they warrant the high court's \"immediate review.\" \"It's an extraordinary measure. It's a late, election eve decision,\" Greisa Mart\u00ednez, a DACA recipient and deputy executive director of the immigrant advocacy group United We Dream, told CBS News. \"(Mr. Trump) is trying to use the Supreme Court to move forward his political goals of wiping this country of young people of color.\" DACA, short for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was instituted by President Obama through an executive order in 2012. The program allows young undocumented immigrants, dubbed DREAMers, to obtain work authorizations and driver's licenses if they meet certain requirements, including having arrived in the U.S before they were 16 and obtaining an American high school diploma, GED or serving honorably in the military. \u00a0 After several conservatives states threatened to sue the Trump administration if it kept DACA alive, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a gradual winding down of the program in the fall of 2017. But the Second, Ninth and D.C. Circuits blocked the government from completely dismantling DACA.  USCIS currently allows more than 700,000 DACA recipients to renew their protections \u2014 valid for two years \u2014 but it is not accepting new applications.  Echoing remarks by the president and his attorney general, Francisco argued the government had correctly decided to end the program \"based on serious doubts about its legality and the practical implications of maintaining it.\" The third highest ranking official at the Justice Department mentioned that the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments on one of the DACA cases in May, has not yet issued a ruling. Francisco added that the Court should consolidate all the cases surrounding the program and take up the issue this term.  In the summer of 2016, DAPA \u2014 a similar Obama-era program which would have shielded around 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation \u2014 was blocked by a 4-4 deadlock in the Supreme Court. The seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia's death had not been filled at the time.  If the court decides to accept the administration's request and review the DACA case this term, two justices appointed by President Trump will be sitting on the bench, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

            "article_content": "President Trump continued his push to end birthright citizenship Wednesday, with days to go before the midterm elections, claiming the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship does not apply to the children of undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump first mentioned ending birthright citizenship via executive order in an interview with Axios that aired Tuesday morning.\u00a0 \"So-called Birthright Citizenship, which costs our Country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other,\" the president tweeted Wednesday morning. \"It is not covered by the 14th Amendment because of the words 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' Many legal scholars agree.....\" The citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment, crafted in order to grant citizenship to former slaves, states that, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" In the past, when Republicans have suggested eliminating birthright citizenship, they have done so by floating a constitutional amendment, not an executive action.\u00a0 Meanwhile, even some in his own party claim the president cannot reverse birthright citizenship via executive order. Retiring Speaker of the House\u00a0Paul Ryan on Tuesday declared\u00a0flatly that Mr. Trump \"cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.\"\u00a0 Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan, was one of the first Republicans to object to the president's announcement to end birthright citizenship. He tweeted Tuesday, \"A president cannot amend Constitution or laws via executive order. Concept of natural-born citizen in #14thAmendment derives from natural-born subject in Britain. Phrase 'and subject to the jurisdiction thereof' excludes mainly foreign diplomats, who are not subject to U.S. laws.\" Even Vice President Mike Pence, on the campaign trail in 2016, declared birthright citizenship was \"settled law.\" The president's top advisers haven't publicly gone as far as the president's claim that birthright citizenship is not covered by the 14th Amendment. Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway told reporters Tuesday night the Supreme Court had simply never provided a \"solid\" answer the the question.\u00a0 \"There are constitutional scholars who say the 14th Amendment has been misinterpreted and actually the Supreme Court has never gave a solid opinion on this,\" Conway said.\u00a0 The Supreme Court has touched on the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment numerous times. In 1898, in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court ruled that \"Every person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, becomes at once a citizen of the United States, and needs no naturalization.\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Democrats on the ballot have one last chance to make their closing arguments to voters in this last weekend before Election Day. In a political season that has been\u00a0more geared toward national\u00a0concerns than in previous elections, the campaigns have been bitter and partisan, and the challenge for Democrats is to break through -- especially with the onslaught of both legitimate crises and\u00a011th hour political stunts\u00a0from a White House anxious to shift the momentum. At this late stage, it's no longer about persuading people on the fence. Campaigns should be focused on getting the converted to their polling places. For Democrats, the message is simple: We are better than this. President Trump is doing everything he can to try to control the news cycles he has dominated since he stepped into the political spotlight, floating half-baked trial balloons like ending birthright citizenship, claiming he'll advance a middle class tax cut, and sending thousands of troops to the border to whip up his base, which is already terrified by his\u00a0false characterizations of a caravan\u00a0of asylum seekers who won't be reaching the U.S. border for weeks.\u00a0 His latest volley \u2013 a\u00a0racist video\u00a0of a convicted cop killer who happens to be an undocumented immigrant \u2013 makes it clear where he's driving the discussion in these final days of the campaign. All of this could actually help Democrats.\u00a0 Frustration with the president might push sporadic voters who don't typically wade into midterm elections to head to the polls and sway independents and moderates. Early vote numbers indicate turnout is already higher than previous cycles \u2014\u00a040 percent of ballots\u00a0had already been cast as of Halloween morning. In key states like Georgia, Florida, Nevada, Michigan, and Texas, numbers are up significantly, including among\u00a0young voters, which could be good news for Democrats like Stacey Abrams and Beto O'Rourke looking for upset victories. So what should Democrats focus on in these final days? Local matters It would be a mistake for any Democrats to make their final pitch to voters exclusively about Trump. Even in this hyper-national landscape, Democrats can't forget that local elections require a local frame \u2013 and voters need to believe a candidate understands their needs and has a vision for making their lives better. Voters are still worried about how they're going to pay the bills, what kind of education their children will have, and whether they can afford to visit the doctor. This election is a broader referendum on Republicans, who hold both houses of Congress, the White House, and the overwhelming majority of governor's mansions nationwide. Republicans campaigned in 2016 on repealing Obamacare, but their efforts failed because they couldn't answer the question, \"Then what?\" A jittery public worried about losing health care coverage ultimately doomed the repeal effort in the Senate. Yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is still thinking about\u00a0trying again to repeal\u00a0the Affordable Care Act and\u00a0cutting back on Medicare and Medicaid\u00a0to help pay for the ballooning deficit caused by the Trump tax cuts.\u00a0 Democrats should be pounding home the message that they're the ones who will protect health care coverage for Americans and pushing back on disingenuous\u00a0claims by Republicans\u00a0that they'll protect people with pre-existing conditions. The latest\u00a0CBS News polling\u00a0illustrates this point. In Florida, Arizona, and Indiana, where the U.S. Senate races remain hotly contested, voters say health care tops their concerns, and protections for pre-existing conditions are a specific factor in determining which party they'll support. Voters want to know they're not one illness away from bankruptcy. Don't boo -- vote We'll see if Democrats are able to translate the rage and anxiety in our communities into voters. Women in the suburbs, in particular, are expected to be a decisive voting bloc in dozens of congressional, Senate, and other statewide races. The #MeToo movement is likely to motivate large swaths of women to head to the ballot box.\u00a0 At the same time, Democrats can speak to the broader phenomenon increasingly described as a kind of\u00a0\"Trump Anxiety Disorder.\"\u00a0Effective democracy requires faith in our institutions, experienced leadership, and a steady hand in both peace and in crisis. In the era of Trump, we have none of these. Americans have seen the most contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearings in decades, a White House and Cabinet that's constantly turning over, and a president who stokes fears, snubs traditional U.S. allies while embracing strongmen, and peddles falsehoods daily. It's no surprise that they want a check on Donald Trump \u2013 in some surveys by as much as a\u00a02 to 1 margin. Most important, Democrats must convince the so-called Obama coalition to go to the polls. Former President Obama's call to action, \"Don't boo, vote\" has never applied more. Remind young people their voice matters and\u00a0arm them with the information\u00a0to make smart choices. Remind the\u00a0communities of color\u00a0that often sit out off-year elections that they should be using their power to affect the outcome of these elections. Time is short. Get-out-the-vote weekend starts now, and early voting continues in 37 states around the country.\u00a0 CBSN contributor Lynda Tran is a founding partner of progressive grassroots strategy firm 270 Strategies",

            "article_content": "Charlie LeDuff is channeling America's rage. It's a rage that unites vast swathes of the country, he says, from protesters in Ferguson to Flint, Michigan, to Detroit, to Chicago, and back to New York, even if people in those groups don't naturally find common ground. LeDuff, both in his new book and in the seat opposite CBSN anchor Elaine Quijano on \"Red & Blue,\" lists the best-known flashpoints of America's economic decline - most of which he's spent time in. Flint; the border with Mexico; McAllen, Texas; Detroit and Erie, Pennsylvania. LeDuff describes them all in vignettes of pure frustration \u2013 a common bedrock of rage that roiled the 2016 election and, according to LeDuff, led the nation to where it is now.\u00a0 \"People are angry, universally, at the government,\" he tells CBSN. \"Pick your form: Local, federal, state. Flint: They failed, them, they poisoned them \u2026 Ferguson, it wasn't just because the police dropped a black guy, they've been doing that for 400 years.\" LeDuff's cameraman is a Flint native, so naturally, they went there to report.\u00a0 \"We go to Flint, the factory is gone,\" LeDuff said.\u00a0 \"There's a last-chance trailer park, and everybody's teeth are red. I ask the lady: 'Why's everybody's teeth red?' She goes: 'Ah, you know, they changed the water. They said it's safe to drink but it tastes like shit, so you've gotta mix it with Kool-Aid to get it down.' Two days later: First boil water advisory \u2014 we all know what happened in Flint, by the way but we don't know what's happening with Flint because that flavor of the month is gone, the media don't want to come any more.\"\u00a0 The jab at the media of which he's part is deliberate. His book is titled \"Sh*tshow: The Country's Collapsing \u2026 and the Ratings Are Great\", and while he's arguable part of the elite (LeDuff counts a Pulitzer among his many awards) he's made his mark by staying on the noisier side of police cordons and avoiding the safe scrums of traditional broadcast journalism in places like Ferguson. LeDuff visits Detroit, where people whose water has been shut off by the government are going to an abandoned building, where they forgot to turn it off. At the Mexican border, he describes how he kayaked the Rio Grande with undocumented immigrants. In North Dakota, an unemployed Latino oil worker from the Deep South offers him oral sex for $20 to pay for shelter in the cold.\u00a0 LeDuff sees it all as interlinked. Jobs are gone. By his telling, far from stemming the losses, the government seems to be aiding and abetting the spiriting away of jobs and prosperity.\u00a0 \"Let's put it this way. [A] guy loses the value of his home because of what Wall Street's done, right, and its puppets in Washington,\" LeDuff said. \"He goes to Iraq, or his brother or his cousin, and they come back home on popsicle sticks and they wait for that appointment at the V.A. that never seems to be coming and guys are dying or waiting while they lie about it. The job is is off to Mexico. Right. Then you go to Mexico and there's the former jobs from Flint and they're making a dollar an hour and these clowns have been telling us it's six an hour. \"Ask somebody in Ferguson: \"The government is my enemy.\" Ask somebody in Flint: \"The government is my enemy.\" Ask somebody that used to have that job. Like, 'What about us?'\"",

The organization has raised $95 million so far in the 2018 cycle, as the GOP tries to maintain control of Congress. Mr. Trump jokingly took credit for the last two years of record-setting March fundraising dinners. \"Now we must work to keep our majority,\" Mr. Trump said. \"... There's no reason why we shouldn't win with what we've done over the last year.\" Mr. Trump said the Democratic Party has gone to the left of where it once was \u2014 \"we have to go a little bit further right,\" he added.\u00a0 The president went on to say their \"America first\" agenda is exceeding expectations. Mr. Trump also touted unemployment rates for black and Hispanic individuals, and women. Mr. Trump said he will be campaigning for Republicans around the country this year. But he emphasized the GOP \"cannot be complacent,\" and noted Democrats' energy.\u00a0 The president took an opportunity to bash Democrats, claiming they don't want to find solutions for undocumented \"Dreamers\" and want open borders. He also went after Rep. Maxine Waters, calling her a \"low IQ individual\" \u2014 an insult he has used in the past.\u00a0 Overall though, Mr. Trump's message Tuesday night was calm, measured, and on-message \u2014 something that hasn't been the case lately when he speaks to a large audience. Mr. Trump is known to go off-script at these types of events. At the last fundraiser where Mr. Trump spoke, closed to the press, the president claimed he didn't know whether the U.S. had a trade surplus or deficit with Canada when he told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau the foreign leader was wrong about trade. Mr. Trump insisted there was no trade surplus, even though the U.S. Trade Representative says the U.S. has a substantial surplus with its northern neighbor.\u00a0 The president's alleged conversation with Trudeau isn't the only conversation with a foreign leader that's gained attention lately. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his victory in an election filled with allegations of ballot stuffing. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said it isn't the place for the U.S. to dictate how other countries run their elections.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, who announced in October that he would not seek re-election.  Arpaio was convicted in July for contempt after he ignored an order to end traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.

            "article_content": "Pakistan's new Prime Minister Imran Khan pledged to grant citizenship to Pakistan-born children of Afghan and Bengali refugees who have been living in the country for decades.  At a fundraiser, Khan said a lack of documentation and education for the children has prevented them from getting jobs, forcing them to turn to crime. But CBSN contributor Alex Kliment of GZERO Media said the decision could have positive political consequences for Khan since many of the refugees are part of the Pashtun ethnic group, which largely voted for Khan's political party in the recent election. \"If he gives citizenship and passports and access to public services to a million and a half people, those people may well become loyal voters of his,\" Kliment said. The military, which is very powerful in Pakistan, is opposed to the plan citing security threats. At times, Kliment said the military has also tried to use refugees as a bargaining chip in the country's tense relationship with Afghanistan's government. \"The Pakistani military knows full well if they were to unceremoniously dump 1.5 million people in Afghanistan -- a country which is already straining to keep itself together -- that could well provoke a humanitarian and even political crisis that the U.S. backed government in Kabul would be none too pleased about,\" Kliment said. This comes as the U.S. plans to admit 30,000 refugees in 2019, the lowest refugee cap in U.S. history. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the announcement Monday, calling the new figures \"expansive.\" But Pompeo also referenced a backlog of asylum seekers, calling it a \"daunting challenge.\" He said there are over 800,000 asylum cases pending. In 2019, the U.S. plans to process only 280,000 asylum seekers. The refugee vetting process in the U.S. can take 24 months. With humanitarian crises worldwide, there are refugees coming from places like Syria, Yemen and Myanmar. So a lower number of refugees admitted by the U.S. could impact refugee organizations trying to keep up.",

            "article_content": "BAGHDAD -- Polls closed across Iraq Saturday evening in the first national election since the country declared victory over the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The vote -- the fourth since the 2003 U.S.-led toppling of Saddam Hussein -- was marked by reports of low turnout and irregularities.\u00a0 Results are expected within the next 48 hours, according to the independent body that oversees Iraq's election, but negotiations to choose a prime minister tasked with forming a government are expected to drag on for months.  Voting began early Saturday morning in a contest that had no clear front-runner after weeks of official campaigning. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's stiffest competition came from political parties with closer ties to Iran.  Baghdad's streets began to fill up with cars before voting concluded Saturday evening after al-Abadi partially lifted a security curfew in an effort to improve turnout. Nearly all civilian vehicles had been banned from Baghdad's streets Saturday morning and many voters complained of having to walk more than 2.5 miles to reach polling stations.  Iraq's most senior Shiite cleric spoke out on the issue of voter participation Saturday afternoon, encouraging Iraqis to vote \"to prevent the arrival of a corrupt parliament.\"  \"The lack of participation will give the opportunity for others to reach parliament and they will be very far from the aspirations of the people,\" said Sheikh Abdul-Mahdi al-Karbalai, the representative of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, on local Iraqi television from Karbala. Sistani has repeatedly encouraged Iraqis to vote into power Saturday a new political class to combat corruption.  In Mosul, turnout appeared to be higher with over 40 percent of eligible voters casting their ballots at polling stations across the city, according to the deputy commander of Nineveh operation command, Brig. Gen. Jassem Mohammed Khalil.  For those who did attempt to vote, some in Baghdad complained of voting irregularities at polling stations linked to a new electronic voting system implemented for the first time this year in an effort to reduce fraud.  Nouri al-Maliki, al-Abaid's predecessor and arguably his most powerful opponent, said he was aware of \"violations\" at some polling stations in Iraq, adding that  the process lacked proper oversight.  \"We are not reassured,\" al-Maliki told the Associated Press in a phone interview.  Thamer Aref, 45, along with his wife and daughter were turned away from a polling station north of central Baghdad.  Aref had turned in his old voter ID card months ago for the biometric identification card required by the new system. However, Aref's biometric card wasn't ready ahead of Saturday and, with neither card, the polling station did not allow him to a cast a ballot.  \"I lost my right to vote,\" he said.  Associated Press journalists documented several similar cases at a number of different polling stations across Baghdad Saturday morning. Amira Muhammed, the supervisor of a polling station in Azamiyah, Baghdad, said some people couldn't vote because they did not pick up their new biometric ID cards in time.\u00a0 \"The problem is not with us,\" she said.\u00a0  A member of Iraq's electoral commission also deflected blame for Saturday's reported irregularities.  \"There were some problems with the electronic equipment due to misuse by some employees,\" Hazem al-Ridini told the AP.  In central Baghdad, voters supporting al-Abadi said they are doing so because they give him credit for Iraq's military victory over ISIS. Al-Abadi \"took revenge\" for civilians killed in insurgent attacks in Iraq \"with the victory over Daesh,\" said 71-year-old Felihah Hassan, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS. After ISIS overran nearly a third of Iraq in the summer of 2014, the group launched waves of suicide bombings targeting civilians in Baghdad and other pockets of government-controlled territory.  With support from the U.S.-led coalition and Iran, al-Abadi oversaw a grueling war against the extremists and declared victory over the group in December.\u00a0 Despite al-Abadi's military achievements, Iraq continues to struggle with an economic downturn sparked in part by a drop in global oil prices, entrenched corruption and years of political gridlock. Many in Iraq are disillusioned by a weak economy, as well as widespread government corruption,\u00a0BBC News reports.\u00a0 The vote also comes days after President Donald Trump announced the U.S. is withdrawing from the\u00a0Iran nuclear agreement, and some Iraqis fear their country could become a victim in any struggle between Iran and the U.S. \u00a0 In addition to al-Maliki, al-Abadi's most powerful competition is from an alliance of candidates with close ties to the country's powerful, mostly Shiite paramilitary forces, and an alliance led by influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.  Jassim Mohsen, 58, who fought against ISIS with the paramilitary forces, said he's casting his vote for the alliance with paramilitary ties because of their personal sacrifices.  \"I elected the Fatah list because they are the only ones who fought Daesh and gave blood,\" he said.  Some Sunnis voting Saturday said they are hopeful this election will help Iraq move beyond sectarian politics and become more inclusive.  Marginalization of Iraq's Sunnis under al-Maliki is seen as a factor that allowed ISIS to rise in power in Iraq. Al-Abadi has led a more cross-sectarian government marked by his ability to balance the interests of his two allies often at odds: the U.S. and Iran.  The war left more than 2 million Iraqis, mostly Sunnis, displaced from their homes, with cities, towns and villages suffering heavy destruction. Repairing infrastructure across Anbar and Nineveh provinces, both majority Sunni areas, will cost tens of billions of dollars.  Abdulrazaq Kubi and his wife Suheila Mahdi, both Sunnis from Baghdad, said they would not be voting for al-Abadi, casting their votes instead for a Sunni-led political alliance.  \"The victory is not 100 percent, there is still Daesh here,\" said Mahdi. The government \"is neglecting the refugees because they are Sunni. They left them in the camps, in the winter it floods, in the summers, they go hungry,\" she added.  In total there are 329 parliament seats at stake, with nearly 7,000 candidates from dozens of political alliances.  Iraq's constitution allows lawmakers more than three months after the ratification of the election results to form a government. But many expect the process to drag on for much longer if there is no clear winner, as dozens of political parties attempt to cobble together a political bloc large enough to hold a majority of seats in parliament.

That is, if you're taking their measure not by where they finished their journeys, but from where they started. In Minnesota, 36-year Ilhan Omar became the first ever Somali-American elected to Congress. Her politics are unremarkable for a Democrat: support for single payer health care and gun control. But her life story is quite remarkable.  \"It's a cold state but the people have warm hearts and we don't just  welcome immigrants, but we send them to Washington,\" Omar said.   Born in Somalia, she and her family fled the violence of civil war when she was 8. After years in a refugee camp in Kenya, she immigrated to the U.S. when she was 11, learning English in three months and mastering politics in the years that followed. Democrat Safiya Wazir, 27, is the first refugee ever elected to New Hampshire's state house. Her family fled Afghanistan and the Taliban 21 years ago, and spent 10 years in a refugee camp before making their way here. She studied the dictionary at night to learn English. \"One thing a younger generation can do, is the energy they have, you want to be an advocate for seniors and young people and working families,\" Wazir said. These days our politics clearly can frustrate, anger and divide. But these two winners provide a much needed reminder that our elections still have the power to inspire.\u00a0  Jim Axelrod is the chief investigative correspondent and senior national correspondent for CBS News, reporting for \"CBS This Morning,\" \"CBS Evening News,\" \"CBS Sunday Morning\" and other CBS News broadcasts.",

Keith Ellison. Tlaib won Michigan's 13th district. Omar spoke during her campaign about her opposition to President Trump's travel ban against Muslim countries. In her \"CBS This Morning\" interview, she said she hoped to bring a \"unique insight\" into the \"lives and struggles\" of refugees when she goes to Washington in January. \"When I was coming to this country, I heard about it's promises,\" she said. But those promises, she said \"aren't extended to everyone.\" \"I couldn't sit on the sidelines,\" she said. Omar was part of a record group of 53 women who ran for the Senate and 476 women who ran for the House of Representatives in 2018.

            "article_content": "In the sprawling refugee camp that's sprung up in recent months to house hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution and death in Myanmar, one of the busiest spots is an electronics repair shop. \"I use the term 'shop' pretty loosely. It's really just tarp underneath trees,\" reports CBS News' Adam Yamaguchi. Inside that makeshift shop, technicians take apart and reassemble mobile phones that provide a lifeline for desperate refugees. The devices are ubiquitous in this muddy camp, just across the border in Bangladesh, where basic necessities like clean water and adequate food are in short supply. \"Everybody has a cellphone,\" Yamaguchi says. \"This is how people get informed. This is how people communicate with family that have been strewn about many different camps -- some still across the border in Myanmar.\" The phones are also essential for Rohingya reporters and activists who use them to evade government censors and smuggle out news and video of the atrocities to the outside world, while international aid workers and journalists have been barred from the region and even\u00a0arrested for trying to cover the crisis. \"We communicate through phone calls, and through WhatsApp and through WeChat, and through IM, and through Messenger, Facebook Messenger,\" said 30-year-old Ro Aung Zaw (a pseudonym he uses to protect his safety). He fled when his village was attacked and destroyed and is now part of a closely guarded network of about 20 members risking their lives to expose what\u00a0U.N. officials say may amount to a genocide. Rohingya Muslims make up a small minority of the population in the mostly Buddhist nation of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. They have long faced discrimination and repression, and have largely been denied citizenship by the government, although many families have lived in villages concentrated in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state for generations.\u00a0 After a Rohingya militant group attacked police posts and an army base in August, killing 12 security force members, the military responded with a campaign of indiscriminate violence against the Rohingya population. Troops burned homes and villages to the ground, killing thousands of men, women and children in tactics widely condemned as ethnic cleansing. \"The clearest evidence is, would be the satellite imagery that shows 340 destroyed villages. Not houses -- villages,\" said David Mathieson, an independent analyst who has lived and worked in the region for years.\u00a0 Over the last six months, nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled their homes, many with horrific memories of seeing loved ones slaughtered or of surviving gang rapes. \"The government's main plan is\u2026 to carry out slow and steady genocide and to wipe out this minority, clearly,\" said Ro Aung Zaw. And yet, Mathieson notes, \"the horrific violence that's driven at least hundreds of thousands of people into Bangladesh has been collectively overwhelmingly denied by so many people in Myanmar.\" It's not just a campaign of silence -- it's one of systematic disinformation and persecution fueled by social media. In a tragic irony, some of the same digital tools the refugees consider a lifeline have been weaponized against them. \"Social media has been, I think, one of the most damaging aspects of\u00a0 this entire crisis,\" Mathieson said. \"And I think people internationally need to realize that five years ago, it cost a couple hundred dollars to get a sim card. Not many people had phones. And so, what we've seen in the past three or four years is this country getting online, everyone having a cheap smartphone and access to Facebook. And so there's not the media literacy, there's not the kind of ability to understand this medium, and the limitations of online speech.\" The number of Facebook users in Myanmar has skyrocketed from about 2 million in 2014 to more than 30 million today. The regime and its allies' views of events permeate users' news feeds -- and mindsets. Facebook has now come under fire after reports said it mishandled data from more than 50 million users, allowing consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to access the data. Facebook has since suspended the firm -- that once worked for the 2016 Trump campaign -- for violating its privacy policy. A whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, told CBS News that the data is a \"political gold mine.\" \"If you're trying to influence an American election, that's a one stop shop,\" Wylie said. The government, led by former dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has promoted that message, reinforcing the widely-held belief that the Rohingya are not rightful citizens and downplaying abuses in the face of extensive evidence. \"I don't think there's ethnic cleansing going on. I think ethnic cleansing is too strong an expression to use for what's happening,\" Aung San Suu Kyi told BBC News. \"What she has said has been really quite deplorable,\" Mathieson said. \"She has denied the scale of this. She has questioned credible reports of really grave, serious crimes. ... It's contributed to dehumanizing the Rohingya, to whipping up ultra-nationalism and to degrading the relationship with the international community.\" Since 2012, the country has seen an upsurge in extreme Buddhist nationalism. CBS News spoke with Ashin Sopaka*, a senior monk in the extreme Buddhist nationalist movement whose organization maintains an active Facebook presence. \"They call themselves Rohingya, but these Bengali people burn their own houses and they flee to another country. We did not burn their houses, as you see with the recent attack, they attacked the police posts,\" he said. \"We will not give them any land. Not even one inch. They are people that want to kill people.\" Yamaguchi observed, \"When I go through Facebook, many of your prominent leaders and some of your biggest supporters post some of the most racist, vile, disgusting content I've ever seen online.\" \"Every person has their own opinion. That is their own feeling, but it is not representative of the organization,\" he replied. On the streets of Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, those views are pervasive. Many perpetuate the false narrative of Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and repeat the claim that the Rohingya burned their own villages. \"Those people came over illegally from Bangladesh due to overpopulation,\" one man said. Another asserted, \"Never accept a Rohingya in Myanmar.\" Voices trying to counter that message include a punk rocker named Kyaw Kyaw, who says he faces virulent attacks online for supporting Rohingyas' rights. \"Technology is like a bomb in Myanmar. Right now everybody has a mobile phone. Everybody use social media, especially Facebook. They don't know how to respect the people. ... They don't know what is private or public. They need this education fast,\" he said. Thet Swe Win, a Buddhist civil rights activist, is one of the few liberal voices in the country willing to speak out about the Rohingya, yet he feels he must be guarded with his words. At a recent human rights conference he avoided confronting the issue directly because of the hostility. \"This Rohingya case, it divided the people. I have seen many of the human rights defenders supporting the killing of the Rohingya people. They wrote it on Facebook: 'They should not be here, they're intruders, they're terrorists, kill them all.' It makes me not speak out as much as I want to those people,\" he said. And he casts a wary eye toward the future. \"I'm very worried about my kids. They are very addicted to internet. They know how to use YouTube, Facebook, everything, you know? My daughter is just 4 and a half years old, and she knows everything.\" Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that the quote is from Buddhist monk Ashin Sopaka, not Wirathu, the leader of his organization.",

            "article_content": "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip --\u00a0Hundreds of Palestinians converged on the Gaza Strip's border fence with Israel on Friday, trying to rip through it before drawing heavy Israeli fire in one of the most violent incidents yet in five weeks of protests. Three Palestinians were killed and dozens were reported wounded. The violence came shortly after a top U.N. official urged Israel to refrain from using excessive force against the protesters. At least 38 protesters have been killed by Israeli live fire and more than 1,600 wounded in the weekly protests since they began March 30. Israel has rejected the international criticism, saying it is defending its sovereign border and accusing Gaza's Hamas leaders, who are organizing the protests, of using the crowds as cover to carry out attacks. In Friday's unrest, a large crowd gathered a few hundred meters from the border, with some throwing stones and setting tires on fire in what has become a weekly occurrence. Late in the afternoon, dozens of young men broke away from the larger protest, moving south about 200 meters and approaching the fence. The crowd then tried to break through the fence with hooks and wire cutters when Israeli forces opened fire. Witnesses said three protesters briefly crossed into Israel and turned around. Hundreds of additional protesters ran to the scene, and the numbers quickly grew to several thousand. Israeli armored vehicles sped to the site and fired barrages of tear gas. As gunfire erupted, the crowd dispersed. A dozen Palestinian ambulances jammed a dirt road lining up to evacuate the wounded. Some in the crowd shouted \"shahid,\" or \"martyr\" as bodies were taken away on stretchers. Palestinian health officials reported three people killed and 611 wounded, including 138 hit by live fire in incidents along the border throughout the day. In a statement, the Israeli military said it had \"thwarted\" an attempted infiltration by Palestinian protesters. It said \"hundreds of rioters\" tried to burn the fence and enter the Israel. It said the crowd threw explosives, firebombs and rocks, and that troops opened fire \"in accordance with the rules of engagement\" and halted the crowd. It released a video showing a young Palestinian man placing a burning tire along the fence in an apparent attempt to set it on fire. In another, a small group lobs stones at an Israeli military vehicle on the other side of the fence. In other incidents, the military said Palestinian crowds rolled burning tires, hurled rocks and flew kites with flaming objects attached with the goal of damaging the fence and other Israeli targets. It also released a photo appearing to show a group of youths tugging at barbed wire along the fence. The marches, aimed in part at trying to break a decade-old border blockade, have been organized by Gaza's militant Hamas rulers but have also been driven by widespread despair in the coastal territory of 2 million people. Gaza organizers say the marches are also pressing for the \"right of return\" of refugees and their descendants to what is now Israel. Two-thirds of Gaza residents are descendants of refugees who fled or were expelled from properties during the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948. The protests are to culminate on May 15, the anniversary of Israel's creation. Hamas organizers have made conflicting statements about whether they plan a mass border breach at some point. Hamas' supreme leader, Ismail Haniyeh, visited a protest camp in the southern town of Rafah, vowing larger protests in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and among Palestinian refugees in other countries on May 15. \"Our people will not slow down the protests until they get their rights,\" he said. The Israeli military has repeatedly said it will not allow Gazans to burst across the border. Israeli communities are located just a few hundred meters away. However, Israel has come under heavy international criticism for allegedly using excessive force. Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said Israeli troops have not heeded warnings by the United Nations and others, repeatedly using lethal force against unarmed protesters in the past month. Gaza health officials say that four minors, including a 14-year-old boy, have been among the dead. \"The loss of life is deplorable, and the staggering number of injuries caused by live ammunition only confirms the sense that excessive force has been used against demonstrators -- not once, not twice, but repeatedly,\" the commissioner said. Israel's U.N. ambassador, Danny Danon, said Israel is \"diligently defending its sovereignty\" and accused Zeid of encouraging Hamas' \"exploitation of civilians.\" He said the commissioner is \"not focused on human rights, but only with obsessively criticizing Israel.\" Thousands have taken part in the Friday demonstrations from five protest tent camps, each set up several hundred meters (yards) from the border fence. Small groups usually move toward the fence, setting tires ablaze to hamper the vision of the security forces while others throw stones or firebombs. Israeli soldiers, including snipers taking cover behind sand berms, have responded by firing tear gas, rubber-coated steel pellets and live rounds. Israel's military has said troops are under orders to target \"instigators,\" but has also warned that anyone approaching or trying to damage the fence risks his life. Rights groups have said such open-fire rules are unlawful because they allow soldiers to use potentially lethal force in situations where their lives are not in danger. Israeli officials have said that some of the protesters in recent weeks tried to damage the border fence or plant explosives along it. Others have tried to set Israeli fields on fire on the other side of the fence by hurling improvised explosives or firebombs, or flying the flaming kites. A group of Palestinian activists calling themselves \"the tires unit\" arrived Friday on a truck laden with old tires. A van mounted with loudspeakers followed the truck with chants and applause. Tires were set ablaze, filling the air with thick smoke. With hooks and a long rope, the activists pulled at parts of the barbed wire adjacent to the fence. Israel and Egypt imposed the Gaza blockade in 2007, in response to a violent takeover of the territory by Hamas, which had won Palestinian parliament elections a year earlier. The blockade has gutted Gaza's economy, driving up unemployment and leaving two-thirds of young people without jobs. Hamas' Interior Ministry announced that Egypt had agreed to open the Rafah border crossing for three days, beginning Saturday. The temporary opening is the second this month.",

He was 80.\u00a0 His foundation announced his death in Switzerland on Saturday in a tweet, saying he died after a short unspecified illness.  \"Wherever there was suffering or need, he reached out and touched many people with his deep compassion and empathy,\" the foundation said. It is with immense sadness that the Annan family and the Kofi Annan  Foundation announce that Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the  United Nations and Nobel Peace Laureate, passed away peacefully on  Saturday 18th August after a short illness... pic.twitter.com/NDOy2NmAAs Annan spent virtually his entire career as an administrator in the United Nations. His aristocratic style, cool-tempered elegance and political savvy helped guide his ascent to become its seventh secretary-general, and the first hired from within. He served two terms from Jan. 1, 1997, to Dec. 31, 2006, capped nearly mid-way when he and the U.N. were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001.\u00a0 During his tenure, Annan presided over some of the worst failures and scandals at the world body, one of its most turbulent periods since its founding in 1945. Challenges from the outset forced him to spend much of his time struggling to restore its tarnished reputation.  His enduring moral prestige remained largely undented, however, both through charisma and by virtue of having negotiated with most of the powers in the world.\u00a0 When he departed from the United Nations, he left behind a global organization far more aggressively engaged in peacekeeping and fighting poverty, setting the framework for the U.N.'s 21st-century response to mass atrocities and its emphasis on human rights and development.  \"Kofi Annan was a guiding force for good,\" current U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. \"It is with profound sadness that I learned of his passing.  In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination.\"\u00a0 The UN Migration Agency called him \"a great man, a leader, and a visionary.\" Today we mourn the loss of a great man, a leader, and a visionary: former @UN Secretary General @KofiAnnan.A life well lived. A life worth celebrating. pic.twitter.com/3sLmy7VS2p Annan was known to diplomats as a lifer -- a career diplomat at the U.N. who remained active after his two terms as the U.N. chief, CBS News' Pamela Falk reports. \u00a0 Even out of office, Annan never completely left the U.N. orbit. He returned in special roles, including as the U.N.-Arab League's special envoy to Syria in 2012. He remained a powerful advocate for global causes through his eponymous foundation.  Annan took on the top U.N. post six years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and presided during a decade when the world united against terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks -- then divided deeply over the U.S.-led war against Iraq. The U.S. relationship tested him as a world diplomatic leader.  \"I think that my darkest moment was the Iraq war, and the fact that we could not stop it,\" Annan said in a February 2013 interview with TIME magazine to mark the publication of his memoir, \"Interventions: A Life in War and Peace.\"  \"I worked very hard -- I was working the phone, talking to leaders around the world. The U.S. did not have the support in the Security Council,\" Annan recalled in the videotaped interview posted on The Kofi Annan Foundation's website.  \"So they decided to go without the council. But I think the council was right in not sanctioning the war,\" he said. \"Could you imagine if the U.N. had endorsed the war in Iraq, what our reputation would be like? Although at that point, President (George W.) Bush said the U.N. was headed toward irrelevance, because we had not supported the war. But now we know better.\"  Despite his well-honed diplomatic skills, Annan was never afraid to speak candidly. That didn't always win him fans, particularly in the case of Bush's administration, with whom Annan's camp spent much time bickering. Much of his second term was spent at odds with the United States, the U.N.'s biggest contributor, as he tried to lean on the nation to pay almost $2 billion in arrears.  Kofi Atta Annan was born April 8, 1938, into an elite family in Kumasi, Ghana, the son of a provincial governor and grandson of two tribal chiefs.\u00a0 He shared his middle name Atta -- \"twin\" in Ghana's Akan language -- with a twin sister, Efua. He became fluent in English, French and several African languages, attending an elite boarding school and the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi. He finished his undergraduate work in economics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1961. From there he went to Geneva, where he began his graduate studies in international affairs and launched his U.N. career.  Annan married Titi Alakija, a Nigerian woman, in 1965, and they had a daughter, Ama, and a son, Kojo. He returned to the U.S. in 1971 and earned a master's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. The couple separated during the 1970s and, while working in Geneva, Annan met his second wife, Swedish lawyer Nane Lagergren. They married in 1984.  Annan worked for the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa in Ethiopia, its Emergency Force in Egypt, and the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva, before taking a series of senior posts at U.N. headquarters in New York dealing with human resources, budget, finance, and staff security.  He also had special assignments. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, he facilitated the repatriation from Iraq of more than 900 international staff and other non-Iraqi nationals, and the release of western hostages in Iraq. He led the initial negotiations with Iraq for the sale of oil in exchange for humanitarian relief.  Just before becoming secretary-general, Annan served as U.N. peacekeeping chief and as special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, where he oversaw a transition in Bosnia from U.N. protective forces to NATO-led troops.  The U.N. peacekeeping operation faced two of its greatest failures during his tenure: the Rwanda genocide in 1994, and the massacre in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in July 1995. In both cases, the U.N. had deployed troops under Annan's command, but they failed to save the lives of the civilians they were mandated to protect.\u00a0 Annan offered apologies, but ignored calls to resign by U.S. Republican lawmakers. After he became secretary-general, he called for U.N. reports on those two debacles -- and they were highly critical of his management.\u00a0 In his book \"Interventions,\" Annan wrote that the experiences of Rwanda and Bosnia pushed him to try to shape the U.N. into an organization that would \"step up rather than stand by.\" \"We've intervened to make life easier for people living with HIV/AIDs,\" he said, \"in the cases of tsunami in Indonesia or earthquake in Pakistan, and on health issues, where the Avian Flu broke out in Asia.\"\u00a0 In 2012, CBS News asked him if he thought the U.N. was better equipped to deal with issues like disease and development rather than conflict. \"Maybe you are right -- in health and other areas, we have the tools and the systems in place. And governments, by and large, cooperate. When it comes to peacekeeping, the U.N. has no standard army. We borrow troops from governments, and sometimes the governments give us their troops and sometimes they don't,\" he said. As secretary-general, Annan forged his experiences into a doctrine called the \"Responsibility to Protect,\" that countries accepted -- at least in principle -- to head off genocide, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and war crimes.  Annan sought to strengthen the U.N.'s management, coherence and accountability, efforts that required huge investments in training and technology, a new whistleblower policy and financial disclosure requirements.  In 1998, he helped ease a transition to civilian rule in Nigeria and visited Iraq to try to resolve its impasse with the Security Council over compliance with weapons inspections and other matters. The effort helped avoid an outbreak of hostilities that seemed imminent at the time.  In 1999, he was deeply involved in the process by which East Timor gained independence from Indonesia, and started the \"Global Compact\" initiative that has grown into the world's largest effort to promote corporate social responsibility.  Annan was chief architect of what became known as the Millennium Development Goals, and played a central role in creating the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the U.N.'s first counter-terrorism strategy.  Annan's uncontested election to a second term was unprecedented, reflecting the overwhelming support he enjoyed from both rich and poor countries. Timothy Wirth, president of the United Nations Foundation, which disburses Ted Turner's $1 billion pledge to U.N. causes, hailed \"a saint-like sense about him.\"  In 2005, Annan succeeded in establishing the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. But that year, the U.N. was facing almost daily attacks over allegations about corruption in the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq, bribery by U.N. purchasing officials and widespread sex abuse by U.N. peacekeepers - an issue that would only balloon in importance after he left office.  It emerged that Annan's son, Kojo, had not disclosed payments he received from his employer, which had a $10 million-a-year contract to monitor humanitarian aid under the oil-for-food program. The company paid at least $300,000 to Kojo so he would not work for competitors after he left.  An independent report criticized the secretary-general for being too complacent, saying he should have done more to investigate matters even if he was not involved with the awarding of the contract.  World leaders agreed to create an internal U.N. ethics office, but a major overhaul of the U.N.'s outdated management practices and operating procedures was left to Annan's successor, Ban Ki-moon.  Before leaving office, Annan helped secure a truce between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, and mediated a settlement of a dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi peninsula.  At a farewell news conference, Annan listed as top achievements the promotion of human rights, the fighting to close the gap between extreme poverty and immense wealth, and the U.N. campaign to fight infectious diseases like AIDS.  He never took disappointments and setbacks personally. And he kept his view that diplomacy should take place in private and not in the public forum.  In his memoir, Annan recognized the costs of taking on the world's top diplomatic job, joking that \"SG,\" for secretary-general, also signified \"scapegoat\" around U.N. headquarters.  Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke called Annan \"an international rock star of diplomacy.\"  After leaving his high-profile U.N. perch, Annan didn't let up. In 2007, his Geneva-based foundation was created. That year he helped broker peace in Kenya, where election violence had killed over 1,000 people.  He also joined \"The Elders,\" an elite group of former leaders founded by Nelson Mandela, eventually succeeding Desmond Tutu as its chairman after a failed interlude trying to resolve Syria's rising civil war.\u00a0 In a statement Saturday, The Elders called Annan \"a voice of great authority and wisdom in public and private.\" The organization said Annan's most recent work was in visits to South Africa and Zimbabwe, where the country was preparing for a historic presidential election.  \"His quiet advice on how best to defuse impending crises was in constant demand from all corners of the globe, in particular from Africa,\" said deputy chair Gro Harlem Brundtland.  As special envoy to Syria in 2012, Annan won international backing for a six-point plan for peace. The U.N. deployed a 300-member observer force to monitor a cease-fire, but peace never took hold and Annan was unable to surmount the bitter stalemate among Security Council powers. He resigned in frustration seven months into the job, as the civil war raged on.  Annan continued to crisscross the globe. In 2017, his foundation's biggest projects included promotion of fair, peaceful elections; work with Myanmar's government to improve life in troubled Rakhine state; and battling violent extremism by enlisting young people to help.  He also remained a vocal commentator on troubles like the refugee crisis; promoted good governance, anti-corruption measures and sustainable agriculture in Africa; and pushed efforts in the fight against illegal drug trafficking.  Annan retained connections to many international organizations. He was chancellor of the University of Ghana, a fellow at New York's Columbia University, and professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.  In his memoir, Annan recognized the costs of taking on the world's top diplomatic job, joking that \"SG,\" for secretary-general, also signified \"scapegoat\" around U.N. headquarters.  Annan is survived by his wife and three children. Funeral arrangement weren't immediately announced.",

            "article_content": "Looking back at 50 years of 60 Minutes, it's worth noting that the longest running broadcast in prime time television history was created by a man with a notoriously short attention span. Don Hewitt was bored by hour-long documentaries and thought any story worth telling could be done in ten or 15 minutes. So he dreamed up this broadcast: three different segments, a little something for everyone. A half a century later, we're here to celebrate Don's very big -- and very successful idea. We'll be profiling 60 Minutes itself: inside stories about its history and its greatest moments. From the archives, we'll have some outtakes and backstage footage you've never seen before. And interviews we've done over the years with the 60 Minutes pioneers who are gone now, but whose stamp on the broadcast is still on display, every Sunday night. The formula for a good 60 Minutes story: keep it timely, keep it relevant and never be dull.\u00a0 Some examples, from this 50th season. Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. We surveyed the damage with the island's governor, Ricardo Rossello. Steve Kroft: There was no safe haven. Ricardo Rossello: There was no safe haven. Just a few weeks earlier, it had been Houston's turn. Scott Pelley found widespread dismay that the city's flood control system was no match for Hurricane Harvey. Cynthia Nealy: It's gonna rain, we're gonna have hurricanes and tropical storms, so by golly, do something to protect your people from it. Also this season: an old warrior's last stand. Lesley Stahl with John McCain. Lesley Stahl: I had to ask him about cancer, he didn't want to go there and I was pushing him there. \u00a0 John McCain: I have feelings sometimes of fear of what happens. But as soon as I get that, I say wait a minute. You've been around a long time old man. You've had a great life. \u00a0 Bill Whitaker's recent story with producer Ira Rosen about the opioid crisis got Washington's attention. \u00a0 Joe Rannazzisi: This is an industry that's out of control. \u00a0If they don't follow the law in drug supply, people die. \u00a0 Joe Rannazzisi once ran the DEA's war on the illicit sale of prescription drugs. A war undermined - on Capitol Hill. An investigation by 60 Minutes and the Washington Post found that under heavy lobbying by the drug industry, lawmakers quietly passed a bill in 2016 making it more difficult to stop the sale of addictive pain pills to shady pharmacies and doctors. Bill Whitaker: Congressman Tom Marino, who pushed this legislation through Congress, was tapped by the Trump Administration to be the new drug czar. And two days after the story ran -- Congressman Marino withdraws his name from being considered. And I would like to think that our story had something to do with that. Jeff Fager: We want to be relevant we want to be current we want to be about today's news. Jeff Fager succeeded Don Hewitt in 2004 as executive producer of 60 Minutes. Jeff Fager: And when we cover a story and report it on Sunday night and it has impact on Monday morning, that's what you hope for. Over the years we've landed timely interviews with world leaders. Putin of Russia. Assad of Syria. Saddam Hussein, with Dan Rather in 2003. The Iraqi leader denied having weapons of mass destruction, a key justification for the impending American invasion. Saddam Hussein: I think America and the world also knows that Iraq no longer has the weapons. It was a controversial interview. But events would prove that what Saddam said about the weapons was correct. In 2015 Pope Francis was about to embark on a trip to the United States. A big story and a rare opportunity for a few questions from 60 Minutes. Scott Pelley: What is your goal for America? To meet people, he told us, just to meet with them. Jeff Fager: I think we're more current now than we were in past years but the values and the standards that we live by are the same as they were the very first broadcast that went on the air in 1968. Some behind the scenes footage of the taping of that first broadcast has survived. It began with Harry Reasoner getting rid of a cigarette. It was, after all, the 60's. \u00a0 \u00a0 Harry and Mike Wallace thought the introduction was perfect. Don Hewitt: Mike, I wanna do it again, you're sitting... But in the control room, Don Hewitt wasn't happy with the way Mike was sitting. And as always, Don got what Don wanted. He was a brash and brilliant man, who not only came up the idea for the broadcast, but ran it for 36 years. And on this day they rolled the tape again -- and rolled the dice on Don's grand experiment. Harry Reasoner: This is 60 Minutes. It's a kind of a magazine for television. And the very first story set the tone for what was to come. 60 Minutes had the only camera in the room as Richard Nixon and friends watched the vote at the Republican Convention. It gave him the nomination for president. Interviewed by Mike on the second program, the candidate made a remark that history would note. Richard Nixon: The most important thing about a public man is not whether he's loved or disliked, but by whether he's respected. And I hope to restore respect to the presidency at all levels by my conduct. Virtually all of the presidents of the last half-century have fielded questions on the broadcast. Lesley Stahl: Are you really gonna build a wall? Donald Trump: Yes. Lesley got the first television interview with Donald Trump shortly after he won the 2016 election. Lesley Stahl: Are people gonna be surprised about how you conduct yourself as President? Donald Trump: Ya know, I'll conduct myself, um, in a very good manner. Lesley Stahl: He was thoughtful. He answered all my questions. Lesley Stahl: But are you gonna be tweeting? Donald Trump: I'm gonna do very restrained if I use it at all\u2026 Lesley Stahl: And I thought, ok he's not gonna tweet anymore. \u00a0We're gonna see something completely different. Got that wrong. We interviewed Barack Obama 18 times. Steve Kroft: Very smart man. Always a pleasure to interview. He was always in the moment, thoughtful and, um, relaxed. I don't kid myself. The reason he did so many stories with us was because of 60 Minutes, not because of me. Because of the power and influence of the show. Mike had known Ronald and Nancy Reagan for years. Mike Wallace: Nancy, of course, was an old, dear friend of mine. \u00a0\u00a0 He'd worked with her mother in his early radio days. Even so, Mrs. Reagan gave as good as she got in their interviews. Nancy Reagan: You're putting words in my mouth, Mike Wallace. \u00a0 Mike Wallace: You can take them out right now. And in a 2006 interview, Mike had no use for the idea that Mr. Reagan was a lightweight. Mike Wallace: Baloney. He knew enough to bring an end to the Cold War. \u00a0 An important interview for the Clintons in 1992, when Bill was running for president. 34 million people watched as the couple fielded questions about Gennifer Flowers. Steve Kroft: She's alleging a 12-year affair with you. Bill Clinton: That allegation is false. Hillary Clinton: Ya know I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. I'm sitting here because I love him. And for added drama, a light fell off the wall and nearly hit them. No one was hurt, but it was a close call. An unusual presidential interview, recalling a dark time. Scott Pelley and George W. Bush on Air Force One -- on the first anniversary of 9-11. \u00a0 George W. Bush: I can remember sitting right here in this office and realizing it was a defining moment in the history of the United States. I knew we were at war. Scott had seen first-hand the horror of that September morning. Scott Pelley: I spent about two weeks at ground zero, reporting continuously. The agony of watching these firefighters digging through, trying to find somebody alive. It was a mountain of misery. For nearly two decades, the most important and dangerous assignments for 60 Minutes correspondents and crews have been covering the seemingly endless cycle of violence in the Middle East. For 16 years Lara Logan has covered Iraq and Afghanistan for 60 Minutes and 60 Minutes II. Recently, she was in Mosul, during the successful campaign to retake the Iraqi city from ISIS. \u00a0 Lara Logan: I think we were there just a few minutes before you heard \"car bomb, car bomb\". And you know it means suicide car bomb\u2026 And everyone's shooting because the only thing that can stop that vehicle reaching its target is a hail of gunfire. And it's terrifying. The 60 Minutes crew took cover in a house commandeered by Iraqi special forces. The car had exploded just 50 feet away. With war, came refugees. By land and by sea. Thousands landed on the Greek island of Lesbos, after a dangerous trip across the Aegean Sea from Turkey. Anderson Cooper was there. Anderson Cooper: It was an extraordinary thing to witness\u2026 So many of them were just exhausted and afraid. People drown on the way over all the time. They're buried in unmarked graves and to die without your name being known in a foreign land and your family doesn't even know what happened to you, to me, that's - an unspeakable tragedy. Television is, of course, a feast for the eyes. An electronic window on the world. But at the heart of every great 60 Minutes story are the interviews. Scott Pelley with one of the men who shot Osama bin Laden. Scott Pelley: You shot him Mark Owen: A handful of times Pelley: And at that point, his body was still. Mark Owen: Yes. You have to ask the right questions and you have to be fast on your feet. Lara Logan: How many times have you been indicted? Morley Safer: What goes through your mind? Lesley Stahl: What is it with you? Mike Wallace: You demanded special treatment. Steve Kroft: Did you think you were gonna get away with it? Scott Pelley: That's not all that's going on here. Bill Whitaker: It almost seems unbelievable. There are rules for conducting a 60 minutes interview. Number one: do your homework. Mike Wallace: Let's get this straight. Bob Simon: Talk to us for a minute Number two: don't be shy. Bob Simon: The prosecution says you're a con man. A thief. Number three: take your time. Wear them down, if need be. Lesley Stahl: Let me interrupt you. And even when you've mastered all that, it's still not as easy as it looks. Ed Bradley: What kind of person would do that? Those are the facts, they're not in dispute. Does that seem strange? Ed Bradley explained in 2001. Ed Bradley:\u00a0My job is to put someone in the chair and get them to talk and tell their story as if there are no cameras, no lights, not seven people in the room. Just the two of us sitting there talking. Ed found Mick Jagger candid - and funny. Ed Bradley: The clich\u00e9 that was associated with the band for so many years - sex, drugs, and rock n roll is - you're beyond that? Mick Jagger: Some of that's still in there, I think. Bob Dylan was something else. Ed Bradley: You know, Bob Dylan hadn't done a television interview in, I guess, almost 20 years. Ed Bradley, speaking to Bob Dylan: I read somewhere that you wrote Blowin' In The Wind in ten minutes. Is that right? Bob Dylan: Probably. Ed Bradley: Sometimes you'd ask a question and he'd say \"yep.\" You know, you wanna say \"C'mon Bob, give it up, give it up. Mike Wallace, of course, was the very model of the hard-nosed reporter asking point-blank questions. Mike Wallace: When you boil it down to low gravy it's quite apparent that somethin' was goin' on there. There was his famous encounter -- during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 -- with Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. Mike asking him, in essence, if he was nuts. Mike Wallace: President Sadat of Egypt calls you, Imam, -- forgive me, his words, not mine -- a lunatic. Mike remembered getting a non-answer and icy stares from the other Iranians in the room. Mike Wallace: Well the guy that was translating, he looked over at me and said, \"You're the lunatic if you think I'm going to translate that question to the Ayatollah.\" He did and it got the Ayatollah's attention for the first time. One of Mike's finest hours came 43 years ago, talking to Clint Hill, one of the secret service agents protecting John Kennedy in Dallas the day the president was shot. \u00a0 Mike Wallace: Was there anything that the Secret Service or that Clint Hill could have done to keep that from happening? Clint Hill: Clint Hill, yes. Hill was on the running board of the car just behind the president. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Clint Hill: If I had reacted about maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today. Mike Wallace: You mean, you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot? Clint Hill: The third shot, yes sir. As it was, he'd made it to the car in five seconds, just as the fatal shot rang out. The guilt consumed him for years. Clint Hill: It's my fault. Mike Wallace: Oh, no one has ever suggested that for an instant. What you did was show great bravery and great presence of mind. Clint Hill: Mike, I don't care about that. If I had reacted just a little bit quicker -- and I could have, I guess. And I'll live with that to my grave. Jeff Fager: It's not always easy to get people to talk, and to open up the way Clint Hill did. That took a long time and Mike Wallace was very patient and sometimes, and Ed Bradley used to say this, sometimes you just have to wait for them to talk. In Washington, a very talkative town, there's one group that's long been camera-shy: the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. But in recent years, several of them have appeared on 60 Minutes. The late Antonin Scalia in 2008. Lesley took him back to his grade school. Lesley Stahl: Straight \"A's\"? \u00a0The whole time? \u00a0Come on. Antonin Scalia: Would I lie? Lesley Stahl: No. Antonin Scalia: If you can't trust me, who can you trust, right? Scalia's fellow conservative, Justice Clarence Thomas, grew up poor in Georgia. Steve Kroft: Indoor plumbing? \u00a0 Clarence Thomas: No, goodness, no. There was an outhouse that we shared with some other families. Justice Sonia Sotomayor's parents immigrated from Puerto Rico. She grew up in a public housing project in New York. Scott Pelley: You know, your brother told us that more than once in this neighborhood he got beaten up. Sonia Sotomayor: Yep. And more than once I beat up the person who beat him up. 60 Minutes has done its fair share of exposes, large and small. \u00a0 We blew the whistle on insider trading in Congress and the never-ending parade of small-time cons. Like turning back the odometers on used cars to get a better price. Steve Kroft: This is not exactly legal, right? Bill Whitlow: This is not exactly legal, no. Bill Whitlow told us how it's done and we showed him how we do it. Steve Kroft: See that picture? There's a TV camera back there. Bill Whitlow: Yep. Steve Kroft: The good news is we're not cops. Bill Whitlow: Well, I didn't think so. Steve Kroft: The bad news is, we're 60 Minutes. Steve Kroft: Sometimes you have to ruin somebody's day. \u00a0But it's always somebody who deserves to have their day ruined\u2026 He did six years in prison for that. But it was Mike, of course, who pioneered the art of confronting the bad guys. Mike Wallace: Track 'em down, follow them into the office or into a barroom or whatever. It became a trademark for the broadcast and got to the point that just a glimpse of anyone from 60 Minutes produced panic in the streets. Gradually, the broadcast backed away from ambushes and hidden cameras except when it's the only way to get the story. Like this one: an especially cruel scam, selling phony stem cell cures to people with devastating illnesses. \u00a0 Steve Watters: If I opt for the permanent fix, will it keep me out of the wheelchair? Larry Stowe: Oh yeah. \u00a0 Scott Pelley: You know, Mister Stowe, the trouble is that you're a con man. Larry Stowe: Really? Scott Pelley: [Larry Stowe] was just selling biochemical garbage that he was putting in these people's veins. And he was taking their money from them, 100 thousand dollars, cash only. \u00a0 Because of the story, Stowe is serving a six-year sentence in federal prison. Over the years we've tackled some tough investigative reports. In 2006, Ed Bradley examined the racially charged case involving three Duke University lacrosse players falsely accused of rape. Ed Bradley: The evidence we've seen reveals disturbing facts about the conduct of the police and the district attorney and raises serious concerns about whether or not a rape even occurred. Ed and the 60 Minutes producers spent six months going over the records of the case, the timeline, photos, medical tests on the accuser -- and concluded there had been a rush to judgment. The charges were dropped, and the district attorney was disbarred. The story Mike and producer Lowell Bergman did in 1996 with whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand told how the tobacco industry lied about the dangers of smoking. A story so controversial that CBS corporate lawyers blocked its broadcast for months, fearing a huge lawsuit. \u00a0 \u00a0 Jeff Fager: The company said, \"You can't air it.\" It's the only time that ever happened in the 50 years of 60 Minutes. After Wigand's disclosures were published elsewhere, the report finally ran. Jeffery Wigand: It's a delivery device for nicotine. Mike Wallace: A delivery device for nicotine? Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix? Jeffery Wigand: You'll get your fix. Jeff Fager: It's incredible in retrospect because the story itself about tobacco was as important as stories get. \u00a0 From the start, the 60 Minutes reporting on the tobacco story was rock solid. But there have been some other cases where stories we've broadcast were on shaky ground, containing serious flaws. There was 'The Mule', a 1997 story about smuggling heroin from Colombia to London. The footage came from an award-winning British documentary which turned out to be fake, with paid actors playing the drug dealers. \u00a0\u00a0 A 2004 report on 60 Minutes II suggested George W. Bush got preferential treatment in the Texas Air National Guard. It was based in part on documents that came into question and could not be verified. And a 2013 story about the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya was built around an interview with a supposed eyewitness who, as it turned out, had lied. Fortunately, the mistakes have been few and far between. Jeff Fager: I think the most important thing is to own up to it, to help the viewer understand how we made the mistake, and to move on, one story at a time, earning our credibility back. The first few seasons of 60 Minutes were a period of trial and error: trying to figure out what worked and what didn't. The stories were sometimes vague, sometimes ponderous -- and despite Don Hewitt's best efforts -- sometimes boring. The audience was small, but CBS stuck with the broadcast, often scheduling it in sacrificial time slots when most of America was watching a hit show somewhere else. As the broadcast evolved, one thing that did work -- and works to this day -- is the travelogue. Trips to exotic places, foreign and domestic. You'd think that, after half a century, we'd run out of destinations. But there's always something new under the sun. Just about every day of the year, somewhere on earth, there's a 60 Minutes crew at work. Documenting the beauties of nature and the landmarks of ancient history. Our cameras have been to the top of the world and the bottom of the sea. In the waters off Capetown, South Africa, Anderson Cooper went swimming with the sharks. Anderson Cooper: Diving with great white sharks is among the stupidest things you can do. \u00a0 But shark expert Mike Rutzen believes they're smart, curious and not as threatening as you'd think. Rutzen studies the great whites with no cage, no protection. \u00a0Anderson did the same. Anderson Cooper: I would do it again, but it was really scary. Yeah. I don't know if I'd do it again, actually. In 2010 we hiked to the edge of an active volcano in Iceland. The eruption sent a huge cloud of ash and rocks the size of cars a thousand feet into the air. Scott Pelley: Look at the earth just erupting up into the sky. In 2007, Bob Simon and producer Draggan Mihailovich landed in a remote village in New Guinea, to a hero's welcome. But the original pathfinder for 60 Minutes was Morley Safer. The most prolific -- and entertaining -- tour guide of all. One of his first journeys was sailing the Indian Ocean. Morley Safer: It is on rare days like this that you must ask, \"Do they really pay me to do this?\" Yes! In Finland, Morley and producer John Tiffin found that, for some reason, the tango was all the rage. But they found the Argentinian dance didn't quite translate. Morley Safer: It's a sad shuffle in a minor key. With lyrics to reaffirm a couple's instinctive sense of hopelessness. Morley loved art and knew his way around the galleries and museums. There was no better companion for viewing the sublime -- and what he considered the ridiculous. He'd take a shot every once in awhile at the pretensions of the modern art establishment. \u00a0\u00a0 And then he'd move on, to the next airplane. And, as he later recalled, to the next adventure. Morley Safer: You get to travel the world, you get to meet some of the world's most atrocious people and some of the world's most interesting ones and somebody else is paying for it. Is there a better job than that? Bob Simon felt the same way. Seven years ago, he traveled into the past for one of his favorite stories. Visiting Mount Athos -- home to ancient Greek monasteries seldom seen by outsiders. During his long career at CBS News, Bob covered dozens of wars and rebellions, from Vietnam to the West Bank to Tiananmen Square. But in his later years, he was ready for something more peaceful. And carved out a role for himself as the Doctor Doolittle of 60 Minutes. The wildlife editor. Bob talked about it in 2011. Bob Simon: An animal is never duplicitous. An animal will never get involved in gratuitous cruelty. And, uh, it's very refreshing to go see them after you've spent a lot of time interviewing politicians. He went to Central Africa, where scientists are beginning to understand how elephants communicate. He went to a remote corner of Brazil in search of jaguars in the wild. Bob Simon: We happened to be there as a jaguar swam from one side of the river to the other. It was a once-in-a-lifetime shot in the dark. He traveled to the edge of the north pole with filmmaker John Downer, whose remote cameras record life among the polar bears. But elephants were his favorite. He and producers Michael Gavshon and Harry Radliffe did three stories on them. Bob Simon: You fall in love with them, and you don't want anyone to hurt them. But as 60 Minutes has reported over the years, African elephants and giraffes are slaughtered by poachers. Other species are affected by climate change and encroaching civilization. Their numbers are dwindling. Bob Simon: We would like to see wild animals survive. That's one of the few editorial positions we can take and get away with. And anyone who disagrees with us, feel free to write a letter. Don Hewitt's model for 60 Minutes was Life magazine. Back in the day, Life did serious stories and picture essays each week -- as well as interviews with movie stars, athletes, and other celebrities. Don figured the mix would work well on television -- and he was right. Many of the best profiles we've broadcast feature the big names from the studios, the stadiums and the playing fields of America. Tiger Woods, at the top of his game. Lebron James, self-proclaimed king of the basketball court, showing Steve why. Tom Brady. You would think that being called the greatest quarterback ever -- as he often is -- would be the ultimate, but... Tom Brady: Me, I think, \"God, there's gotta be more than this.\" \u00a0 Steve Kroft: What's the answer? Tom Brady: I wish I knew. I wish I knew. In 2005, Mike did an interview that turned the spotlight on the darker side of sports. Mike Wallace: What you are saying is that the national pastime, is juiced. Jose Canseco: Yeah. It is. \u00a0 Former baseball star Jose Canseco said he and many other players had used performance-enhancing drugs, PEDs. And soon, other athletes came under suspicion. In 2007, Katie Couric asked Alex Rodriguez about it directly. Katie Couric: Have you ever used steroids or any other performance-enhancing substance? Alex Rodriguez: No. But Rodriguez later admitted he did -- after Anthony Bosch, who ran a Miami drug clinic, told 60 Minutes in 2014 about the drugs he supplied to Rodriguez and other athletes. \u00a0 Scott Pelley: All of them banned? Anthony Bosch: All of them banned. Though he'd denied it many times, cycling champion Lance Armstrong finally admitted using banned drugs -- after his former teammate, Tyler Hamilton came clean on 60 Minutes in 2011. \u00a0 Tyler Hamilton: There was EPO, there was testosterone. Scott Pelley: You saw Lance Armstrong inject EPO? Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, like we all did. And rounding out our sports report: Ed's encounter with Muhammad Ali in 1996. Ali's Parkinson's disease had worsened and at lunch, he appeared to nod off. Ed Bradley: Somebody told me, sometimes when he sleeps, he punches in his sleep. \u00a0 As Ali appeared to sleep he started punching towards Ed. Ed Bradley: Ya know, I'm sorta looking at him and all the sudden he just went... And suddenly Ali sprang awake and scared Ed. Ed Bradley: I almost jumped outa my chair. It was all a prank, a put-on, engineered by the greatest. Muhammad Ali: Yeaaahhh. Ed Bradley: You got me. As for the movies, our star interviews go back 48 years, to Elizabeth Taylor. Elizabeth Taylor: You've got to be kidding. Old Hollywood. Woody Allen: It's so insane. New Hollywood. Denzel Washington: I'm the man for the job. And some -- Al Pacino: Who-ah! Who are timeless. Meryl Streep: I'm doing me. In 2011, Morley interviewed 3-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep. Morley Safer: And then there's the Streep enigma, that hint of a Mona Lisa smile, or as the Italians call the painting, La Giaconda. Meryl Streep: Is that a snake? What is a giaconda? Morley Safer: No, you're thinking of an anaconda. It's the Mona Lisa. Meryl Streep: Okay. Fine. Sorry. \u00a0 Growing up, Streep watched old movies and fell in love with actress Katharine Hepburn. Meryl Streep: I like girls with attitude, you know, moxie. There's an old word. And naturally, Morley had interviewed Hepburn 32 years earlier. Morley Safer: Do you feel like a legend? Katharine Hepburn: I don't think you ever feel like anything. You feel like a bore. Many of Mike's showbiz interviews were in his trademark take-no-prisoners style. Mike Wallace: You'd love to control this piece. Barbra Streisand: Absolutely. Are you kidding? Barbra Streisand. Mike Wallace: How many years have you been in psychotherapy off and on? Barbra Streisand: Why do you sound so accusatory? \u00a0 Shirley MacLaine and her somewhat unconventional ideas. Mike Wallace: You really believe that you lived lives before? Shirley MacLaine: Oh, yes Mike. There is no doubt in my mind about it. Mike Wallace: And you really believe in extraterrestrials? Do they come visit you on the porch? Shirley MacLaine: [gives Mike a mean look] Mike Wallace: Now you're being unpleasant Wallace is what you're saying. Shirley MacLaine: Yes this is what I was afraid of. But you don't have to be that unpleasant it doesn't become you, you know? Mike was equally direct with the king of late night television, Johnny Carson, about his past troubles with drinking. Mike Wallace: There was a time -- when uh -- Johnny Carson: I used to have a little pop, I sure did. I don't handle it well. Mike Wallace: You and -- really you don't? Johnny Carson: I don't handle alcohol well at all. No. Steve interviewed Carson's successor, Jay Leno... Steve Kroft: Do you uh -- \u2026and had a senior moment. Steve Kroft: I just lost my train of thought. And I was trying to remember this question I wanted to ask him. Jay Leno: He's had a stroke! Can we stop!? I was ready to jump in with the paddles. Morley hung out with television icon Jackie Gleason and played some pool, nearly beating the great one. \u00a0 Morley Safer: Gleason looked at me. Eyes narrowed. Ready to kill. And he thought he'd been hustled. Jackie Gleason: Hey. \u00a0Hey. Morley Safer: Goodnight Mr. Gleason. Jackie Gleason: That little snide remark will cost you. Morley Safer: Of course at that point, he just cleaned the table. Jackie Gleason: Did you like that one, pal? Morley Safer: Please. For whatever reason -- musicians often make the best profiles. Most of them, like Lady Gaga, are smart, talented, and -- gaga. Anderson Cooper: What are you wearing today? Lady Gaga: I just didn't want to wear clothes today. Backstage moments: Mick Jagger insisted Ed try a more rock and roll look. Bono gave Lesley Stahl a back rub. Lesley Stahl: Oh my God, I'm getting a Bono massage! Are you rolling? There's a 60 minutes playlist for all sorts of music. \u00a0 Chris Martin sings: Oh Christmas lights\u2026 Steve with Chris Martin of Coldplay. Steve Kroft: You wrote that yesterday? Chris Martin: Yeah, yeah. That's gonna be good though. Johnny Cash and his wife June, 36 years ago, with Harry Reasoner. The story Ed and producer Ruth Streeter did about comedian George Burns featured Bradley and Burns, the Harmony Boys. George Burns: You sing harmony? Ed Bradley: No, I can't carry a tune. And Anderson with Adele - and the song that put her on the map. And we're indebted to Beyonce and company for a backstage interpretation of the 60 Minutes theme song, otherwise known as the stopwatch \u2013 to accompany the line \"we'll be back with some final thoughts in a moment\". Here at 60 Minutes, we stand on the shoulders of giants. A few thoughts from this relative newcomer on those who came before. First and foremost: Don Hewitt. Without his drive, his enthusiasm, his uncanny ability to shape an everyday story into something truly memorable, the broadcast would have folded long ago. Mike Wallace: tough, funny, difficult - the beating heart of 60 Minutes. It made his day to walk through an airport and hear people say -- as they often did -- \"give 'em hell, Mike.\" Morley Safer spent 46 years here, longer than anyone. \u00a0A sophisticate right down to his pocket squares, he was a great writer and a gentleman in a business populated by a fair number of maniacs. Ed Bradley. Versatile. Compassionate. Always the coolest guy in the room. When I was growing up, there was hardly anybody who looked like me on television news. And along came Ed, paving the way for me and many others. Bob Simon was proud of the fact that in nearly a half-century traveling the world for CBS News, he never missed a single flight. He did his last story with the same curiosity and energy as the first. \u00a0 And finally, Andy Rooney, who spent 33 years here as the resident grouch. Since this was his spot in the broadcast, we cede the floor and let Andy speak for himself. Andy Rooney: I don't like to complain all the time but that's what I do for a living and I'm lucky 'cause there's so much to complain about. Public toilets... car mufflers... faucets... fences... cookbooks... the doorknob... Christmas catalogs, gloves... cardboard... cats... It wouldn't hurt if we could improve certain parts of what we're like and how we behave.\u00a0 Maybe the drug companies can come up with a pill that would cure us of the evil in our nature. Things like hate, jealousy, dishonesty, selfishness. And one more thing, but this may be asking too much, I wish there was something we could all take to cure us of stupidity. We close tonight with thanks, to the many people who have made 60 Minutes tick over 50 years - to all the producers, editors, studio personnel, camera and sound people and others who contribute to this broadcast each week. \u00a0 We especially thank you, our viewers for joining us all these years.

            "article_content": "In his new book, \"Us vs. Them: The Failure of Globalism,\" Eurasia Group president and CBS News senior global affairs contributor Ian Bremmer writes about the growing nationalism around the world and support for anti-establishment politicians. No one voted for Donald Trump because he believed the United States was growing more secure and more prosperous. In a country where working-age men without jobs outnumber those with jobs by three to one, and half of unemployed men take daily pain medication, a lot of people want \"change.\" It's hard to imagine what sort of future Americans can expect if the fate of these people is ignored. It's easy to find fault with populists like Trump. He's obnoxious, dishonest, and incompetent. But Donald Trump didn't create \"us vs. them\". \"Us vs. them\" created Donald Trump, and those who dismiss his supporters are damaging the United States.  There are good reasons to want smaller government. It's natural to fear that Washington spends too much money. There are reasons to worry that political correctness will kill freedom of speech and the birth of good ideas. There are plenty of Americans who care sincerely about people with preexisting medical conditions, but who fear that creation of another entitlement program will one day bankrupt the country, leaving government without money to cover anyone.  These people aren't stupid or mean-spirited. They don't hate poor people. Some of them are poor people. Many are Americans who fear that intellect too often overrides common sense, that their countrymen are more interested in what they can get than in who will pay, that too many politicians care more about universal ideals than about American workers and their families, and that the country they knew is fading away. Many Trump voters, including those who once supported Barack Obama, backed him because they wanted change. Actual change, not the kind of change promised on campaign posters. There's a working class in the United States that really has seen more losses than gains from free trade. U.S. infrastructure is crumbling, the country's education system is underperforming, its health care system is in real trouble, and the U.S. penal system doesn't work. American soldiers have fought and died in wars that seemed to accomplish nothing and that were never adequately explained to the American people. These failures belong to the entire U.S. political establishment. Citizens feel lied to or ignored -- by politicians, the mainstream media, the business elite, bankers, and public intellectuals. They believe the game is rigged in someone else's favor, and they have a point.  American democracy itself is eroding. Donald Trump was elected president with votes from 26.3 percent of eligible voters.Hillary Clinton won 26.5 percent, but lost the electoral college. Yet here is the most revealing number: Nearly 45 percent of eligible American voters didn't vote at all.  Some didn't show up because they felt their vote represented a drop in the ocean, and some lived in states where the outcome wasn't in doubt. Others felt that none of the candidates could or would make things better. But many of these more than 100 million eligible American voters just didn't believe the outcome mattered. Just 36.4 percent of those eligible voted in the 2014 midterm congressional elections. It gets worse. According to a study published in The Journal of Democracy, the share of young Americans who say it's important to live in a democratic country has dropped from 91 percent in the 1930s to 57 percent today. Fewer than one in three young Americans say that it's important to live in a democracy. In 1995, just one in sixteen Americans agreed that it would be \"good\" or \"very good\" to have military rule in the United States. In 2016, it was one in six. Trump has made things worse. He has further poisoned the attitudes of his followers toward government and the media, inflicted lasting damage on U.S. ties with close allies, and embarrassed the country before the world. Worst of all, he has deliberately pitted Americans against one another for political gain. We see the polarized electorate in Trump's own poll numbers. His supporters have backed him through conflicts and controversies that would have ended the careers of any other public official, and his detractors wouldn't thank him if he pulled them from a burning building. But when critics focus on the man and ignore the underlying emergencies that lifted him to the White House, they exacerbate the American problem of \"us vs. them\". They make it easier to build walls and harder to help those who need help most. It's much easier to mock Donald Trump, rail at his excesses, and caricature his backers than to work toward solutions to the problems that leave many convinced they have no future and that their fellow Americans don't care. As in the United States, it's easy to demonize those Europeans who fear open borders as heartless racists who care nothing for refugees and hate Muslims. We can ignore those who say their governments have ceded too much power to bureaucrats in Brussels. But these people know that if they welcome unlimited numbers of migrants, they're inviting large numbers of people to risk their lives and those of their children to make the journey and that smaller European countries will struggle to manage the overflow. They're right that not all these migrants are truly refugees, and that encouraging so many to leave their home countries allows autocrats in North Africa and the Middle East to drive out those who don't support them. It is not racist to acknowledge that the best of intentions sometimes produce terrible consequences. Further, democracy is undermined when growing numbers of the decisions that govern people's lives are made by people who don't stand for election within the borders of their countries. Attacking political demagogues like Beppe Grillo and Marine Le Pen is one thing. Dismissing the hopes and fears of those who turn to them exacerbates the problem of us vs. them and makes it more difficult to rework the European social contract in ways that both left and right can accept. Challenges that are serious for the United States and Europe are even more daunting for developing countries. The introduction of automation and artificial intelligence into the workplace will create more turmoil for workers in wealthy countries, but it will be profoundly disruptive in the developing world, where there will be fewer factory jobs to pull less educated people from the countryside into the urban workforce. Governments without money to invest in technological innovation\u2014and to upgrade education systems and retraining programs to help citizens profit from it -- will create fewer opportunities for young people. Social unrest will test the resilience of governments, and political officials will stoke more conflict between us and them to protect their own power and influence. The result will be a widening of the divide between wealthy countries and poor ones -- and between rich and poor within each country. And if we focus mainly on the demagoguery of the populists who try to take advantage of these trends, we will only widen the gap between those who can afford to ignore them and those who can't. There is another danger common to every nation on Earth. Each year, human beings now produce more data than in every previous year combined. The choices we make, particularly online, help algorithms understand our interests, wants, and needs better than our friends and families do. Add the reality that people are easy to influence. Fake news generated on the Internet shapes public perception in ways we still don't fully appreciate, and a coming wave of digitally sophisticated fake images and video will complicate things further. It's not difficult to imagine a world in which technical specialists looking to make money help politicians looking to gain power understand and manipulate us in ways that undermine the political influence of citizens in every country.  Over time, people wise up. They become less easy to fool. But they can easily become more cynical, and that can lead them to turn their backs on politics altogether, leaving elections to be decided by the angriest and most opinionated. In the meantime, there are choices to make. Build walls? Or rewrite the social contract? Both strategies can work in many countries, at least for a while. Both demand capable government with the resources to construct and sustain these systems. The construction of walls won't kill the idea of responsive government. It will simply create a form of digital apartheid that ensures some are well served while others aren't served at all. As in Israel. And, increasingly, as in the United States. Reinvention of the social contract is going to be politically impossible in many countries for many years to come. The sense of crisis isn't yet strong enough, because so many globalists continue to profit from the system as it is, and walls of various kinds will protect them, temporarily, from real danger. Things have to become much worse, particularly for the winners, before they can become better for everyone else. This is the ultimate failure of globalism. Where and when it becomes possible to experiment, efforts to rewrite the social contract will work most easily in countries with relatively homogenous societies, borders that face relatively little pressure, and the means to continually expand economic productivity. But this principle can work in any country where a positive political consensus is possible. Remaking the relationship between citizens and government is much more likely than the construction of walls to create lasting security and prosperity for the greatest number of people. History and personal experience show that people give their best when the best is required of them. That day is coming sooner than we think. Even those who think they want war will change their minds when they see its costs. Human beings use their natural ingenuity to create the tools they need to survive. In this case, survival requires that we invent new ways to live together. Necessity must again become the mother of invention.",

            "article_content": "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -- Gaza's ruling Hamas militant group said Saturday that a man who was gunned down in Malaysia was an important member of the organization, accusing Israel of being behind the brazen killing. Hamas said Palestinian engineer Fadi al-Batsh was a \"loyal\" member and a \"scientist of Palestine's youth scholars.\" It gave no further details on his scientific accomplishments but said he had made \"important contributions\" and participated in international forums in the field of energy.\u00a0 Hamas initially stopped short of blaming Israel, saying only that he had been \"assassinated by the hand of treachery.\" But later its top leader accused Israel's Mossad spy agency intelligence of killing him and threatened retaliation.  Ismail Haniyeh told The Associated Press Saturday that based on previous assassinations \"Mossad is not away from this disgraceful, terrible crime.\"  \"There will be an unsettled account between us and it,\" Haniyeh said at the Gaza mourning tent, referring to Mossad. \"We cannot give up on the blood of our sons, youths and scholars.\"  The Israeli government had no comment. But Israel has a long history of suspected targeting of wanted Palestinian militants in daring overseas operations around the globe and has been linked to other assassinations as well, though it has rarely publicly acknowledged them.  Malaysian police say the 34-year-old al-Batsh was gunned down early Saturday by two assailants who shot at least eight bullets from a motorbike as he was heading to a mosque for dawn prayers in Kuala Lampur. It said closed-circuit television footage showed him targeted by assassins who had waited for him for almost 20 minutes.\u00a0 \"Preliminary investigations found four gunshot wounds on the victim's body. Two bullet slugs were found at the scene of the incident,\" Kuala Lumpur police chief Mazlan Lazim said in a statement, the BBC reports. \"We believe the lecturer was their target because two other individuals walked by the place earlier unharmed.\" Malaysia's deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said the government was looking into the possibility of the involvement of \"foreign agents\" in his killing. He told local media that initial investigations showed the assailants were \"white men\" driving a powerful BMW 1100cc motorbike.  Besides his Hamas affiliation, al-Batsh was also a cousin of Khaled al-Batsh, a senior official in the Islamic Jihad militant group, who accused Mossad of the assassination, without providing evidence.  Though Hamas stressed al-Batsh's scientific background, the funeral service of the Islamic movement's militant wing suggested al-Batsh was actually one of its military commanders. At a mourning tent in the Gaza Strip, a banner described al-Batsh as a member of the military wing. Ten masked militants in camouflage uniforms stood in a line outside the tent in Jabaliya, the slain man's hometown, to greet mourners. The ceremony is typical for senior Hamas commanders.  Al-Batsh specialized in electrical and electronic engineering and worked at a Malaysian university. He had lived there with his family for the past eight years and was an imam at a local mosque. He received his Ph.D degree from the University of Malaya in 2015 and was a senior lecturer at the British Malaysian Institute. His official biography said his research interests included power converters, power quality and renewable energy.  However, Israeli media reported that he was also deeply involved in the Hamas drone development project.  Israel and Hamas are bitter foes who have fought three wars since 2008. Tensions have risen in recent weeks with a series of mass protests along the Gaza border in which 32 Palestinians have been shot dead by Israeli troops since late March.  Hamas says the protests are aimed at breaking a crippling border blockade that was imposed by Israel and Egypt after the Islamic militant group overran Gaza in 2007, a year after winning Palestinian parliamentary elections. It says it also aims to assert the right of refugees to return to their former homes in Israel.  Israel accuses Hamas, which is sworn to Israel's destruction and has carried out dozens of deadly suicide bombings against it, of cynically exploiting Gaza civilians for its political aims by staging the protests and trying to carry out attacks under their cover.  Israel has used lethal force against unarmed protesters, but it says it is only targeting instigators who are trying to damage the border fence with explosives, firebombs and other means. However, the United Nations, the European Union and rights groups have questioned Israel's use of force when soldiers' lives are not in danger and the U.N. and E.U. have called for investigations.  Protests are aiming to culminate in a large border march on May 15, the 70th anniversary of Israel founding. The date is mourned by Palestinians as their \"nakba,\"or catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands were uprooted in the 1948 Mideast war over Israel's creation.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- As far as Africa's concerned, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the Trump administration have some explaining to do. President Donald Trump's description of \"shithole countries\" in January was greeted with a mix of horror and outrage in Africa, where many don't know what to think about the U.S. president -- or what he thinks of them. He's rarely spoken about priorities for the continent, which garnered a mere seven paragraphs on the very last pages of Mr. Trump's National Security Strategy. Report: Rex Tillerson resigns as Secretary of State; Trump names Mike Pompeo as replacement It falls to Tillerson to mend the damage as he travels to the continent on Tuesday, becoming the most senior U.S. official to set foot there since Mr. Trump took office more than a year ago. Tillerson, in a speech laying out the administration's Africa policy, said the continent's rapid economic growth and fast-rising populations mean its future is increasingly linked to America's. He said the U.S. was committed to helping, but that prosperity and basic stability would be impossible until the security situation is brought under control. \"My firm belief is that there is ample opportunity on the continent for economic growth, for greater prosperity, and for responding to global challenges through mutually respectful partnerships,\" Tillerson said. It's a starkly different message from the one Mr. Trump delivered in a meeting with U.S. lawmakers this year that soon became public, forcing humiliated U.S. ambassadors to apologize and Mr. Trump to send a letter to African leaders affirming his respect. Making Tillerson's job harder, he's showing up on the continent with few concrete goals or new actions to announce. As one senior State Department official briefing reporters on condition of anonymity put it: \"There's really no deliverables.\" Mr. Trump hasn't announced a signature initiative to help the continent, such as the PEPFAR program for HIV/AIDS that George W. Bush started, and many of his sweeping budget cuts affect overseas programs that disproportionately help Africa. Tillerson did announce Tuesday $533 million in \"additional humanitarian assistance\" to help with famine and conflict-related needs in Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria, but it was unclear whether all of those funds were new. For Tillerson, who did not visit Africa during his first year as the top U.S. diplomat, it may be that the best way to show deference to a continent suspicious of Mr. Trump is to listen. State Department officials said Tillerson wanted to hear from leaders in Africa in what ways they're most eager to collaborate with the United States. \"It may be a listening tour for him, but it's also a watching tour\" for everyone else, said Witney Schneidman, a former Africa official at the State Department now at the Brookings Institution. \"When do we get to see the outlines of what the Trump Africa policy is?\" Fueling skepticism that Mr. Trump's administration has thought much about Africa is a long list of vacancies that made planning for his visit all the more difficult. Mr. Trump has not named an assistant secretary for Africa to oversee the continent, nor an ambassador to key countries like South Africa.\u00a0 It was unclear how many opportunities Tillerson would have to engage substantively with key leaders and African institutions such as the G5 Sahel joint counterterrorism force given the rapid pace and last-minute nature of his trip. Tillerson will arrive Wednesday in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, currently under a state of emergency to control anti-government protests. The day before Tillerson's departure, about 100 protesters gathered outside Tillerson's office in Washington chanting against the government. He will spend about a week on the continent visiting countries that play key roles in addressing Africa's security challenges, including Nigeria, Chad and Djibouti, which houses the only permanent U.S. military base in Africa. In Djibouti, China's development of its first overseas military base just a few miles away has been cause for concern for the U.S., illustrating the military side of a broader competition between the U.S. and China playing out across the continent. Another top concern is African nations' growing indebtedness to Beijing, which is building infrastructure across the continent. Tillerson, in his speech, warned that China's approach to development in Africa \"encourages dependency\" that undermines its sovereignty and risks its stability. \"Chinese investment has the potential to address Africa's infrastructure gap, but its approach has led to mounting debt and few if any jobs in most countries,\" Tillerson said. Tillerson will also visit Kenya, where the political system is in turmoil over disputes related to President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election. The government reacted aggressively when opposition leader Raila Odinga held a mock inauguration, shutting down TV stations and arresting opposition politicians, but the U.S. has largely voiced support for Kenyatta. The trip comes as the Trump administration reverses course -- again -- on whether to let Americans import the body parts of African elephants shot for recreation. In November, after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said it would lift the Obama-era ban, Mr. Trump personally intervened to keep it in place. But word emerged Tuesday that the administration would start approving elephant trophy importing on a \"case-by-case\" basis. The State Department stressed that the half-billion in additional dollars for Africa that Tillerson announced were humanitarian aid, not development assistance, and would come from the State Department's population and refugees office and from USAID programs for food and disaster assistance. About $184 million was destined South Sudan and $110 million for Somalia amid conflicts in both countries. Another $110 million was earmarked for Ethiopia to help amid a drought, with the remaining $128 million helping Nigeria and the Lake Chad region nations. Though he has yet to visit as diplomat, Tillerson is not a stranger to Africa, which he visited frequently in search of deals in his previous job as CEO of Exxon Mobil. The energy behemoth has significant business dealings in sub-Saharan Africa, including in Chad, Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea.",

            "article_content": "Looking back at 50 years of 60 Minutes, it's worth noting that the longest running broadcast in prime time television history was created by a man with a notoriously short attention span. Don Hewitt was bored by hour-long documentaries and thought any story worth telling could be done in ten or 15 minutes. So he dreamed up this broadcast: three different segments, a little something for everyone. A half a century later, we're here to celebrate Don's very big -- and very successful idea. We'll be profiling 60 Minutes itself: inside stories about its history and its greatest moments. From the archives, we'll have some outtakes and backstage footage you've never seen before. And interviews we've done over the years with the 60 Minutes pioneers who are gone now, but whose stamp on the broadcast is still on display, every Sunday night. The formula for a good 60 Minutes story: keep it timely, keep it relevant and never be dull.\u00a0 Some examples, from this 50th season. Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. We surveyed the damage with the island's governor, Ricardo Rossello. Steve Kroft: There was no safe haven. Ricardo Rossello: There was no safe haven. Just a few weeks earlier, it had been Houston's turn. Scott Pelley found widespread dismay that the city's flood control system was no match for Hurricane Harvey. Cynthia Nealy: It's gonna rain, we're gonna have hurricanes and tropical storms, so by golly, do something to protect your people from it. Also this year: an old warrior's last stand. Lesley Stahl with John McCain. Lesley Stahl: I had to ask him about cancer, he didn't want to go there and I was pushing him there. \u00a0 John McCain: I have feelings sometimes of fear of what happens. But as soon as I get that, I say wait a minute. You've been around a long time old man. You've had a great life. \u00a0 Bill Whitaker's recent story with producer Ira Rosen about the opioid crisis got Washington's attention. \u00a0 Joe Rannazzisi: This is an industry that's out of control. \u00a0If they don't follow the law in drug supply, people die. \u00a0 Joe Rannazzisi once ran the DEA's war on the illicit sale of prescription drugs. A war undermined - on Capitol Hill. An investigation by 60 Minutes and the Washington Post found that under heavy lobbying by the drug industry, lawmakers quietly passed a bill last year making it more difficult to stop the sale of addictive pain pills to shady pharmacies and doctors. Bill Whitaker: Congressman Tom Marino, who pushed this legislation through Congress, was tapped by the Trump Administration to be the new drug czar. And two days after the story ran -- Congressman Marino withdraws his name from being considered. And I would like to think that our story had something to do with that. Jeff Fager: We want to be relevant we want to be current we want to be about today's news. Jeff Fager succeeded Don Hewitt in 2004 as executive producer of 60 Minutes. Jeff Fager: And when we cover a story and report it on Sunday night and it has impact on Monday morning, that's what you hope for. Over the years we've landed timely interviews with world leaders. Putin of Russia. Assad of Syria. Saddam Hussein, with Dan Rather in 2003. The Iraqi leader denied having weapons of mass destruction, a key justification for the impending American invasion. Saddam Hussein: I think America and the world also knows that Iraq no longer has the weapons. It was a controversial interview. But events would prove that what Saddam said about the weapons was correct. In 2015 Pope Francis was about to embark on a trip to the United States. A big story and a rare opportunity for a few questions from 60 Minutes. Scott Pelley: What is your goal for America? To meet people, he told us, just to meet with them. Jeff Fager: I think we're more current now than we were in past years but the values and the standards that we live by are the same as they were the very first broadcast that went on the air in 1968. Some behind the scenes footage of the taping of that first broadcast has survived. It began with Harry Reasoner getting rid of a cigarette. It was, after all, the 60's. \u00a0 \u00a0 Harry and Mike Wallace thought the introduction was perfect. Don Hewitt: Mike, I wanna do it again, you're sitting... But in the control room, Don Hewitt wasn't happy with the way Mike was sitting. And as always, Don got what Don wanted. He was a brash and brilliant man, who not only came up the idea for the broadcast, but ran it for 36 years. And on this day they rolled the tape again -- and rolled the dice on Don's grand experiment. Harry Reasoner: This is 60 Minutes. It's a kind of a magazine for television. And the very first story set the tone for what was to come. 60 Minutes had the only camera in the room as Richard Nixon and friends watched the vote at the Republican Convention. It gave him the nomination for president. Interviewed by Mike on the second program, the candidate made a remark that history would note. Richard Nixon: The most important thing about a public man is not whether he's loved or disliked, but by whether he's respected. And I hope to restore respect to the presidency at all levels by my conduct. Virtually all of the presidents of the last half-century have fielded questions on the broadcast. Lesley Stahl: Are you really gonna build a wall? Donald Trump: Yes. Lesley got the first television interview with Donald Trump shortly after he won the 2016 election. Lesley Stahl: Are people gonna be surprised about how you conduct yourself as President? Donald Trump: Ya know, I'll conduct myself, um, in a very good manner. Lesley Stahl: He was thoughtful. He answered all my questions. Lesley Stahl: But are you gonna be tweeting? Donald Trump: I'm gonna do very restrained if I use it at all\u2026 Lesley Stahl: And I thought, ok he's not gonna tweet anymore. \u00a0We're gonna see something completely different. Got that wrong. We interviewed Barack Obama 18 times. Steve Kroft: Very smart man. Always a pleasure to interview. He was always in the moment, thoughtful and, um, relaxed. I don't kid myself. The reason he did so many stories with us was because of 60 Minutes, not because of me. Because of the power and influence of the show. Mike had known Ronald and Nancy Reagan for years. Mike Wallace: Nancy, of course, was an old, dear friend of mine. \u00a0\u00a0 He'd worked with her mother in his early radio days. Even so, Mrs. Reagan gave as good as she got in their interviews. Nancy Reagan: You're putting words in my mouth, Mike Wallace. \u00a0 Mike Wallace: You can take them out right now. And in a 2006 interview, Mike had no use for the idea that Mr. Reagan was a lightweight. Mike Wallace: Baloney. He knew enough to bring an end to the Cold War. \u00a0 An important interview for the Clintons in 1992, when Bill was running for president. 34 million people watched as the couple fielded questions about Gennifer Flowers. Steve Kroft: She's alleging a 12-year affair with you. Bill Clinton: That allegation is false. Hillary Clinton: Ya know I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. I'm sitting here because I love him. And for added drama, a light fell off the wall and nearly hit them. No one was hurt, but it was a close call. An unusual presidential interview, recalling a dark time. Scott Pelley and George W. Bush on Air Force One -- on the first anniversary of 9-11. \u00a0 George W. Bush: I can remember sitting right here in this office and realizing it was a defining moment in the history of the United States. I knew we were at war. Scott had seen first-hand the horror of that September morning. Scott Pelley: I spent about two weeks at ground zero, reporting continuously. The agony of watching these firefighters digging through, trying to find somebody alive. It was a mountain of misery. For nearly two decades, the most important and dangerous assignments for 60 Minutes correspondents and crews have been covering the seemingly endless cycle of violence in the Middle East. For 15 years Lara Logan has covered Iraq and Afghanistan for 60 Minutes and 60 Minutes II. Most recently, she was in Mosul, during the successful campaign to retake the Iraqi city from ISIS. \u00a0 Lara Logan: I think we were there just a few minutes before you heard \"car bomb, car bomb\". And you know it means suicide car bomb\u2026 And everyone's shooting because the only thing that can stop that vehicle reaching its target is a hail of gunfire. And it's terrifying. The 60 Minutes crew took cover in a house commandeered by Iraqi special forces. The car had exploded just 50 feet away. With war, came refugees. By land and by sea. Thousands landed on the Greek island of Lesbos, after a dangerous trip across the Aegean Sea from Turkey. Anderson Cooper was there. Anderson Cooper: It was an extraordinary thing to witness\u2026 So many of them were just exhausted and afraid. People drown on the way over all the time. They're buried in unmarked graves and to die without your name being known in a foreign land and your family doesn't even know what happened to you, to me, that's - an unspeakable tragedy. Television is, of course, a feast for the eyes. An electronic window on the world. But at the heart of every great 60 Minutes story are the interviews. Scott Pelley with one of the men who shot Osama bin Laden. Scott Pelley: You shot him Mark Owen: A handful of times Pelley: And at that point, his body was still. Mark Owen: Yes. You have to ask the right questions and you have to be fast on your feet. Lara Logan: How many times have you been indicted? Morley Safer: What goes through your mind? Lesley Stahl: What is it with you? Mike Wallace: You demanded special treatment. Steve Kroft: Did you think you were gonna get away with it? Scott Pelley: That's not all that's going on here. Bill Whitaker: It almost seems unbelievable. There are rules for conducting a 60 minutes interview. Number one: do your homework. Mike Wallace: Let's get this straight. Bob Simon: Talk to us for a minute Number two: don't be shy. Bob Simon: The prosecution says you're a con man. A thief. Number three: take your time. Wear them down, if need be. Lesley Stahl: Let me interrupt you. And even when you've mastered all that, it's still not as easy as it looks. Ed Bradley: What kind of person would do that? Those are the facts, they're not in dispute. Does that seem strange? Ed Bradley explained in 2001. Ed Bradley:\u00a0My job is to put someone in the chair and get them to talk and tell their story as if there are no cameras, no lights, not seven people in the room. Just the two of us sitting there talking. Ed found Mick Jagger candid - and funny. Ed Bradley: The clich\u00e9 that was associated with the band for so many years - sex, drugs, and rock n roll is - you're beyond that? Mick Jagger: Some of that's still in there, I think. Bob Dylan was something else. Ed Bradley: You know, Bob Dylan hadn't done a television interview in, I guess, almost 20 years. Ed Bradley, speaking to Bob Dylan: I read somewhere that you wrote Blowin' In The Wind in ten minutes. Is that right? Bob Dylan: Probably. Ed Bradley: Sometimes you'd ask a question and he'd say \"yep.\" You know, you wanna say \"C'mon Bob, give it up, give it up. Mike Wallace, of course, was the very model of the hard-nosed reporter asking point-blank questions. Mike Wallace: When you boil it down to low gravy it's quite apparent that somethin' was goin' on there. There was his famous encounter -- during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 -- with Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. Mike asking him, in essence, if he was nuts. Mike Wallace: President Sadat of Egypt calls you, Imam, -- forgive me, his words, not mine -- a lunatic. Mike remembered getting a non-answer and icy stares from the other Iranians in the room. Mike Wallace: Well the guy that was translating, he looked over at me and said, \"You're the lunatic if you think I'm going to translate that question to the Ayatollah.\" He did and it got the Ayatollah's attention for the first time. One of Mike's finest hours came 42 years ago, talking to Clint Hill, one of the secret service agents protecting John Kennedy in Dallas the day the president was shot. \u00a0 Mike Wallace: Was there anything that the Secret Service or that Clint Hill could have done to keep that from happening? Clint Hill: Clint Hill, yes. Hill was on the running board of the car just behind the president. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Clint Hill: If I had reacted about maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today. Mike Wallace: You mean, you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot? Clint Hill: The third shot, yes sir. As it was, he'd made it to the car in five seconds, just as the fatal shot rang out. The guilt consumed him for years. Clint Hill: It's my fault. Mike Wallace: Oh, no one has ever suggested that for an instant. What you did was show great bravery and great presence of mind. Clint Hill: Mike, I don't care about that. If I had reacted just a little bit quicker -- and I could have, I guess. And I'll live with that to my grave. Jeff Fager: It's not always easy to get people to talk, and to open up the way Clint Hill did. That took a long time and Mike Wallace was very patient and sometimes, and Ed Bradley used to say this, sometimes you just have to wait for them to talk. In Washington, a very talkative town, there's one group that's long been camera-shy: the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. But in recent years, several of them have appeared on 60 Minutes. The late Antonin Scalia in 2008. Lesley took him back to his grade school. Lesley Stahl: Straight \"A's\"? \u00a0The whole time? \u00a0Come on. Antonin Scalia: Would I lie? Lesley Stahl: No. Antonin Scalia: If you can't trust me, who can you trust, right? Scalia's fellow conservative, Justice Clarence Thomas, grew up poor in Georgia. Steve Kroft: Indoor plumbing? \u00a0 Clarence Thomas: No, goodness, no. There was an outhouse that we shared with some other families. Justice Sonia Sotomayor's parents immigrated from Puerto Rico. She grew up in a public housing project in New York. Scott Pelley: You know, your brother told us that more than once in this neighborhood he got beaten up. Sonia Sotomayor: Yep. And more than once I beat up the person who beat him up. 60 Minutes has done its fair share of exposes, large and small. \u00a0 We blew the whistle on insider trading in Congress and the never-ending parade of small-time cons. Like turning back the odometers on used cars to get a better price. Steve Kroft: This is not exactly legal, right? Bill Whitlow: This is not exactly legal, no. Bill Whitlow told us how it's done and we showed him how we do it. Steve Kroft: See that picture? There's a TV camera back there. Bill Whitlow: Yep. Steve Kroft: The good news is we're not cops. Bill Whitlow: Well, I didn't think so. Steve Kroft: The bad news is, we're 60 Minutes. Steve Kroft: Sometimes you have to ruin somebody's day. \u00a0But it's always somebody who deserves to have their day ruined\u2026 He did six years in prison for that. But it was Mike, of course, who pioneered the art of confronting the bad guys. Mike Wallace: Track 'em down, follow them into the office or into a barroom or whatever. It became a trademark for the broadcast and got to the point that just a glimpse of anyone from 60 Minutes produced panic in the streets. Gradually, the broadcast backed away from ambushes and hidden cameras except when it's the only way to get the story. Like this one: an especially cruel scam, selling phony stem cell cures to people with devastating illnesses. \u00a0 Steve Watters: If I opt for the permanent fix, will it keep me out of the wheelchair? Larry Stowe: Oh yeah. \u00a0 Scott Pelley: You know, Mister Stowe, the trouble is that you're a con man. Larry Stowe: Really? Scott Pelley: [Larry Stowe] was just selling biochemical garbage that he was putting in these people's veins. And he was taking their money from them, 100 thousand dollars, cash only. \u00a0 Because of the story, Stowe is serving a six-year sentence in federal prison. Over the years we've tackled some tough investigative reports. In 2006, Ed Bradley examined the racially charged case involving three Duke University lacrosse players falsely accused of rape. Ed Bradley: The evidence we've seen reveals disturbing facts about the conduct of the police and the district attorney and raises serious concerns about whether or not a rape even occurred. Ed and the 60 Minutes producers spent six months going over the records of the case, the timeline, photos, medical tests on the accuser -- and concluded there had been a rush to judgment. The charges were dropped, and the district attorney was disbarred. The story Mike and producer Lowell Bergman did in 1996 with whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand told how the tobacco industry lied about the dangers of smoking. A story so controversial that CBS corporate lawyers blocked its broadcast for months, fearing a huge lawsuit. \u00a0 \u00a0 Jeff Fager: The company said, \"You can't air it.\" It's the only time that ever happened in the 50 years of 60 Minutes. After Wigand's disclosures were published elsewhere, the report finally ran. Jeffery Wigand: It's a delivery device for nicotine. Mike Wallace: A delivery device for nicotine? Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix? Jeffery Wigand: You'll get your fix. Jeff Fager: It's incredible in retrospect because the story itself about tobacco was as important as stories get. From the start, the 60 Minutes reporting on the tobacco story was rock solid. But there have been some other cases where stories we've broadcast were on shaky ground, containing serious flaws. There was 'The Mule', a 1997 story about smuggling heroin from Colombia to London. The footage came from an award-winning British documentary which turned out to be fake, with paid actors playing the drug dealers. \u00a0\u00a0 A 2004 report on 60 Minutes II suggested George W. Bush got preferential treatment in the Texas Air National Guard. It was based in part on documents that came into question and could not be verified. And a 2013 story about the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya was built around an interview with a supposed eyewitness who, as it turned out, had lied. Fortunately, the mistakes have been few and far between. Jeff Fager: I think the most important thing is to own up to it, to help the viewer understand how we made the mistake, and to move on, one story at a time, earning our credibility back. The first few seasons of 60 Minutes were a period of trial and error: trying to figure out what worked and what didn't. The stories were sometimes vague, sometimes ponderous -- and despite Don Hewitt's best efforts -- sometimes boring. The audience was small, but CBS stuck with the broadcast, often scheduling it in sacrificial time slots when most of America was watching a hit show somewhere else. As the broadcast evolved, one thing that did work -- and works to this day -- is the travelogue. Trips to exotic places, foreign and domestic. You'd think that, after half a century, we'd run out of destinations. But there's always something new under the sun. Just about every day of the year, somewhere on earth, there's a 60 Minutes crew at work. Documenting the beauties of nature and the landmarks of ancient history. Our cameras have been to the top of the world and the bottom of the sea. In the waters off Capetown, South Africa, Anderson Cooper went swimming with the sharks. Anderson Cooper: Diving with great white sharks is among the stupidest things you can do. \u00a0 But shark expert Mike Rutzen believes they're smart, curious and not as threatening as you'd think. Rutzen studies the great whites with no cage, no protection. \u00a0Anderson did the same. Anderson Cooper: I would do it again, but it was really scary. Yeah. I don't know if I'd do it again, actually. In 2010 we hiked to the edge of an active volcano in Iceland. The eruption sent a huge cloud of ash and rocks the size of cars a thousand feet into the air. Scott Pelley: Look at the earth just erupting up into the sky. In 2007, Bob Simon and producer Draggan Mihailovich landed in a remote village in New Guinea, to a hero's welcome. But the original pathfinder for 60 Minutes was Morley Safer. The most prolific -- and entertaining -- tour guide of all. One of his first journeys was sailing the Indian Ocean. Morley Safer: It is on rare days like this that you must ask, \"Do they really pay me to do this?\" Yes! In Finland, Morley and producer John Tiffin found that, for some reason, the tango was all the rage. But they found the Argentinian dance didn't quite translate. Morley Safer: It's a sad shuffle in a minor key. With lyrics to reaffirm a couple's instinctive sense of hopelessness. Morley loved art and knew his way around the galleries and museums. There was no better companion for viewing the sublime -- and what he considered the ridiculous. He'd take a shot every once in awhile at the pretensions of the modern art establishment. \u00a0\u00a0 And then he'd move on, to the next airplane. And, as he later recalled, to the next adventure. Morley Safer: You get to travel the world, you get to meet some of the world's most atrocious people and some of the world's most interesting ones and somebody else is paying for it. Is there a better job than that? Bob Simon felt the same way. Six years ago, he traveled into the past for one of his favorite stories. Visiting Mount Athos -- home to ancient Greek monasteries seldom seen by outsiders. During his long career at CBS News, Bob covered dozens of wars and rebellions, from Vietnam to the West Bank to Tiananmen Square. But in his later years, he was ready for something more peaceful. And carved out a role for himself as the Doctor Doolittle of 60 Minutes. The wildlife editor. Bob talked about it in 2011. Bob Simon: An animal is never duplicitous. An animal will never get involved in gratuitous cruelty. And, uh, it's very refreshing to go see them after you've spent a lot of time interviewing politicians. He went to Central Africa, where scientists are beginning to understand how elephants communicate. He went to a remote corner of Brazil in search of jaguars in the wild. Bob Simon: We happened to be there as a jaguar swam from one side of the river to the other. It was a once-in-a-lifetime shot in the dark. He traveled to the edge of the north pole with filmmaker John Downer, whose remote cameras record life among the polar bears. But elephants were his favorite. He and producers Michael Gavshon and Harry Radliffe did three stories on them. Bob Simon: You fall in love with them, and you don't want anyone to hurt them. But as 60 Minutes has reported over the years, African elephants and giraffes are slaughtered by poachers. Other species are affected by climate change and encroaching civilization. Their numbers are dwindling. Bob Simon: We would like to see wild animals survive. That's one of the few editorial positions we can take and get away with. And anyone who disagrees with us, feel free to write a letter. Don Hewitt's model for 60 Minutes was Life magazine. Back in the day, Life did serious stories and picture essays each week -- as well as interviews with movie stars, athletes, and other celebrities. Don figured the mix would work well on television -- and he was right. Many of the best profiles we've broadcast feature the big names from the studios, the stadiums and the playing fields of America. Tiger Woods, at the top of his game. Lebron James, self-proclaimed king of the basketball court, showing Steve why. Tom Brady. You would think that being called the greatest quarterback ever -- as he often is -- would be the ultimate, but... Tom Brady: Me, I think, \"God, there's gotta be more than this.\" \u00a0 Steve Kroft: What's the answer? Tom Brady: I wish I knew. I wish I knew. In 2005, Mike did an interview that turned the spotlight on the darker side of sports. Mike Wallace: What you are saying is that the national pastime, is juiced. Jose Canseco: Yeah. It is. \u00a0 Former baseball star Jose Canseco said he and many other players had used performance-enhancing drugs, PEDs. And soon, other athletes came under suspicion. In 2007, Katie Couric asked Alex Rodriguez about it directly. Katie Couric: Have you ever used steroids or any other performance-enhancing substance? Alex Rodriguez: No. But Rodriguez later admitted he did -- after Anthony Bosch, who ran a Miami drug clinic, told 60 Minutes in 2014 about the drugs he supplied to Rodriguez and other athletes. \u00a0 Scott Pelley: All of them banned? Anthony Bosch: All of them banned. Though he'd denied it many times, cycling champion Lance Armstrong finally admitted using banned drugs -- after his former teammate, Tyler Hamilton came clean on 60 Minutes in 2011. \u00a0 Tyler Hamilton: There was EPO, there was testosterone. Scott Pelley: You saw Lance Armstrong inject EPO? Tyler Hamilton: Yeah, like we all did. And rounding out our sports report: Ed's encounter with Muhammad Ali in 1996. Ali's Parkinson's disease had worsened and at lunch, he appeared to nod off. Ed Bradley: Somebody told me, sometimes when he sleeps, he punches in his sleep. \u00a0 As Ali appeared to sleep he started punching towards Ed. Ed Bradley: Ya know, I'm sorta looking at him and all the sudden he just went... And suddenly Ali sprang awake and scared Ed. Ed Bradley: I almost jumped outa my chair. It was all a prank, a put-on, engineered by the greatest. Muhammad Ali: Yeaaahhh. Ed Bradley: You got me. As for the movies, our star interviews go back 47 years -- to Elizabeth Taylor. Elizabeth Taylor: You've got to be kidding. Old Hollywood. Woody Allen: It's so insane. New Hollywood. Denzel Washington: I'm the man for the job. And some -- Al Pacino: Who-ah! Who are timeless. Meryl Streep: I'm doing me. In 2011, Morley interviewed 3-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep. Morley Safer: And then there's the Streep enigma, that hint of a Mona Lisa smile, or as the Italians call the painting, La Giaconda. Meryl Streep: Is that a snake? What is a giaconda? Morley Safer: No, you're thinking of an anaconda. It's the Mona Lisa. Meryl Streep: Okay. Fine. Sorry. \u00a0 Growing up, Streep watched old movies and fell in love with actress Katharine Hepburn. Meryl Streep: I like girls with attitude, you know, moxie. There's an old word. And naturally, Morley had interviewed Hepburn 32 years earlier. Morley Safer: Do you feel like a legend? Katharine Hepburn: I don't think you ever feel like anything. You feel like a bore. Many of Mike's showbiz interviews were in his trademark take-no-prisoners style. Mike Wallace: You'd love to control this piece. Barbra Streisand: Absolutely. Are you kidding? Barbra Streisand. Mike Wallace: How many years have you been in psychotherapy off and on? Barbra Streisand: Why do you sound so accusatory? \u00a0 Shirley MacLaine and her somewhat unconventional ideas. Mike Wallace: You really believe that you lived lives before? Shirley MacLaine: Oh, yes Mike. There is no doubt in my mind about it. Mike Wallace: And you really believe in extraterrestrials? Do they come visit you on the porch? Shirley MacLaine: [gives Mike a mean look] Mike Wallace: Now you're being unpleasant Wallace is what you're saying. Shirley MacLaine: Yes this is what I was afraid of. But you don't have to be that unpleasant it doesn't become you, you know? Mike was equally direct with the king of late night television, Johnny Carson, about his past troubles with drinking. Mike Wallace: There was a time -- when uh -- Johnny Carson: I used to have a little pop, I sure did. I don't handle it well. Mike Wallace: You and -- really you don't? Johnny Carson: I don't handle alcohol well at all. No. Steve interviewed Carson's successor, Jay Leno... Steve Kroft: Do you uh -- \u2026and had a senior moment. Steve Kroft: I just lost my train of thought. And I was trying to remember this question I wanted to ask him. Jay Leno: He's had a stroke! Can we stop!? I was ready to jump in with the paddles. Morley hung out with television icon Jackie Gleason and played some pool, nearly beating the great one. \u00a0 Morley Safer: Gleason looked at me. Eyes narrowed. Ready to kill. And he thought he'd been hustled. Jackie Gleason: Hey. \u00a0Hey. Morley Safer: Goodnight Mr. Gleason. Jackie Gleason: That little snide remark will cost you. Morley Safer: Of course at that point, he just cleaned the table. Jackie Gleason: Did you like that one, pal? Morley Safer: Please. For whatever reason -- musicians often make the best profiles. Most of them, like Lady Gaga, are smart, talented, and -- gaga. Anderson Cooper: What are you wearing today? Lady Gaga: I just didn't want to wear clothes today. Backstage moments: Mick Jagger insisted Ed try a more rock and roll look. Bono gave Lesley Stahl a back rub. Lesley Stahl: Oh my God, I'm getting a Bono massage! Are you rolling? There's a 60 minutes playlist for all sorts of music. \u00a0 Chris Martin sings: Oh Christmas lights\u2026 Steve with Chris Martin of Coldplay. Steve Kroft: You wrote that yesterday? Chris Martin: Yeah, yeah. That's gonna be good though. Johnny Cash and his wife June, 35 years ago, with Harry Reasoner. The story Ed and producer Ruth Streeter did about comedian George Burns featured Bradley and Burns, the Harmony Boys. George Burns: You sing harmony? Ed Bradley: No, I can't carry a tune. And Anderson with Adele - and the song that put her on the map. And we're indebted to Beyonce and company for a backstage interpretation of the 60 Minutes theme song, otherwise known as the stopwatch \u2013 to accompany the line \"we'll be back with some final thoughts in a moment\". Here at 60 Minutes, we stand on the shoulders of giants. A few thoughts from this relative newcomer on those who came before. First and foremost: Don Hewitt. Without his drive, his enthusiasm, his uncanny ability to shape an everyday story into something truly memorable, the broadcast would have folded long ago. Mike Wallace: tough, funny, difficult - the beating heart of 60 Minutes. It made his day to walk through an airport and hear people say -- as they often did -- \"give 'em hell, Mike.\" Morley Safer spent 46 years here, longer than anyone. \u00a0A sophisticate right down to his pocket squares, he was a great writer and a gentleman in a business populated by a fair number of maniacs. Ed Bradley. Versatile. Compassionate. Always the coolest guy in the room. When I was growing up, there was hardly anybody who looked like me on television news. And along came Ed, paving the way for me and many others. Bob Simon was proud of the fact that in nearly a half-century traveling the world for CBS News, he never missed a single flight. He did his last story with the same curiosity and energy as the first. \u00a0 And finally, Andy Rooney, who spent 33 years here as the resident grouch. Since this was his spot in the broadcast, we cede the floor and let Andy speak for himself. Andy Rooney: I don't like to complain all the time but that's what I do for a living and I'm lucky 'cause there's so much to complain about. Public toilets... car mufflers... faucets... fences... cookbooks... the doorknob... Christmas catalogs, gloves... cardboard... cats... It wouldn't hurt if we could improve certain parts of what we're like and how we behave.\u00a0 Maybe the drug companies can come up with a pill that would cure us of the evil in our nature. Things like hate, jealousy, dishonesty, selfishness. And one more thing, but this may be asking too much, I wish there was something we could all take to cure us of stupidity. We close tonight with thanks, to the many people who have made 60 Minutes tick over 50 years - to all the producers, editors, studio personnel, camera and sound people and others who contribute to this broadcast each week. \u00a0 We especially thank you, our viewers for joining us all these years.

            "article_content": "When truck driver Chris Gromek wants to know what's really going on in Washington, he scans the internet and satellite radio. He no longer flips TV channels because networks such as Fox News and MSNBC deliver conflicting accounts tainted by politics, he says. \"Where is the truth?\" asks the 47-year-old North Carolina resident. Answering that question accurately is a cornerstone of any functioning democracy, according to none other than Thomas Jefferson. But a year into Donald Trump's fact-bending, media-bashing presidency, Americans are increasingly confused about who can be trusted to tell them reliably what their government and their commander in chief are doing. Interviews across the polarized country as well as polling from Trump's first year suggest people seek out various outlets of information, including Trump's Twitter account, and trust none in particular. Many say that practice is a new, Trump-era phenomenon in their lives as the president and the media he denigrates as \"fake news\" fight to be seen as the more credible source. \"It has made me take every story with a large grain, a block of salt,\" said Lori Viars, a Christian conservative activist in Lebanon, Ohio, who gets her news from Fox and CNN. \"Not just from liberal sources. I've seen conservative 'fake news.'\" Democrat Kathy Tibbits of Tahlequah, Oklahoma, reads lots of news sources as she tries to assess the accuracy of what Trump is reported to have said. \"I kind of think the whole frontier has changed,\" said the 60-year-old lawyer and artist. \"My degree is in political science, and they never gave us a class on such fiasco politics.\" Though Trump's habit of warping facts has had an impact, it's not just him. Widely shared falsehoods have snagged the attention of world leaders such as Pope Francis and former President Barack Obama. Last year, false conspiracy theories led a North Carolina man to bring a gun into a pizza parlor in the nation's capital, convinced that the restaurant was concealing a child prostitution ring. Just last week, after the publication of an unflattering book about Trump's presidency, a tweet claiming that he is addicted to a TV show about gorillas went viral and prompted its apparent author to clarify that it was a joke. Trump has done his part to blur the lines between real and not. During the campaign, he made a practice of singling out for ridicule reporters covering his raucous rallies. As president, he regularly complains about his news coverage and has attacked news outlets and journalists as \"failing\" and \"fake news.\" He's repeatedly called reporters \"the enemy of the people\" and recently renewed calls to make it easier to sue for defamation. About 2 in 3 American adults say fabricated news stories cause a great deal of confusion about the basic facts of current affairs, according to a Pew Research Center report last month. The survey found that Republicans and Democrats are about equally likely to say that \"fake news\" leaves Americans deeply confused about current events. Despite the concern, more than 8 in 10 feel very or somewhat confident that they can recognize news that is fabricated, the survey found. Victoria Steel, 50, of Cheyenne, Wyoming, said it's important for people to invest time in finding reputable media sources or even friends to get the most information they can. \"You're probably not going to get enough information out of sound bites, and you're certainly not going to get it in a tweet,\" said Steel, who says she voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news from social media, Pew found. \"I think part of the problem is that now people are getting too much information and it confuses them and they don't know how to decipher the true and the fake,\" said Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader from Mississippi who's worked in Washington for nearly half a century. He isn't fond of Trump's Twitter habit, but also says he sees bias in the coverage of Washington by the mainstream media. There's been no love for the media for decades. The percentage expressing a great deal of confidence in the press has eroded from a high of 28 percent in 1976 to just 8 percent in 2016, according the General Social Survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. \"Trump didn't invent this. He didn't cause people to start feeling this way. He's tapping into a vein that already existed,\" said Gary Abernathy, publisher and editor of the Times-Gazette of Hillsboro, Ohio, one of the few daily papers that endorsed Trump. People, he added, \"are nodding their heads right away because that's how they've felt.\" Nicco Mele, director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, views Trump as a symptom of long-term trends. \"Now, can he accelerate them and make them worse? Almost certainly.\" When Trump labels something \"fake news,\" \u2033I just have started assuming ... whatever he's talking about must be true,\" said 46-year-old Joseph Murray of Mustang, Oklahoma, a registered independent. \"I feel like that attitude didn't start until he took office.\" Trump tends to inflate the significance of what he's done. He claims his tax cuts are the biggest in history, his accomplishments surpass those of all previous presidents, and his election victory was a \"landslide.\" None is true. He still insists there were millions of illegal votes cast in the 2016 election, even though there's no such evidence. Even on matters existential, Trump makes things up. Taunted on Twitter by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump responded Jan. 3 that his own nuclear button \"is a much bigger and powerful one than his, and my Button works!\" There is no such physical button. Trump often bypasses the vast information-gathering apparatus that reports to him in favor of getting his reality from TV, or sometimes just his gut. That has led him to conclude wrongly that a rare riot in Sweden over a drug crime was instead linked to refugee extremism. He also falsely claimed that Obama tapped his phones at Trump Tower in the campaign. \"I'm a very instinctual person, but my instinct turns out to be right,\" he told Time magazine. Besides, \"I'm quoting highly respected people from highly respected television networks.\"",

            "article_content": "Former President Obama is in Georgia Friday evening to rally for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who is locked in a tight race with Republican Brian Kemp, capping off a day of campaign events for Democrats. Mr. Obama emphasized this election could be the \"most important of our lifetime\" while also highlighting Abrams. \"I'm hear for one simple reason: To ask you to vote,\" Mr. Obama said. \"The consequences of any of us staying home are profound because America is at a crossroads ... The character of our country is on the ballot.\" In an earlier rally on Friday, Mr. Obama had said he doesn't understand why Mr. Trump and his supporters are \"so angry all the time.\" At the Atlanta rally, Mr. Obama accused Republicans of using \"constant, incessant, non-stop attempts to divide us. Rhetoric that is designed to make us angry \u2014 to make us fearful.\" Mr. Obama criticized Republicans \u2014 and especially Mr. Trump \u2014 for the \"scare tactics\" in the election. \"Now in the year 2018, they are telling you the biggest threat to America are some impoverished refugees thousands of miles away,\" Mr. Obama said. \"That's not enough to lie about it \u2014 they are sending our brave troops ... they are sending them down there for a political stunt when they could be with their families.\"\u00a0 Earlier on Friday, Mr. Obama traveled to Florida to rally for Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, two days after President Trump visited the state to stump for their Republican opponents. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama is engaged in a final campaign swing before the midterm elections. He is campaigning against Mr. Trump's agenda and Republican candidates less than two years after he left office, a departure from a historical norm in which former presidents tend to avoid openly criticizing their successors. Abrams' campaign has attracted support from prominent celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, who has canvassed and rallied with the candidate. Actor\u00a0Michael B. Jordan has knocked on doors in Atlanta urging black voters to turn out and actor and comedian Will Ferrell has also canvassed for Abrams' campaign. Abrams has been largely focused on turning out communities which don't usually turn out in high numbers during midterm elections, such as black voters and young people. If elected, Abrams would be the first black woman elected governor in the country. Mr. Obama is rallying with Abrams at Morehouse College, a widely respected historically black college. The Georgia gubernatorial race has been roiled by claims of voter suppression. As Georgia secretary of state, Kemp oversees election infrastructure, which Democrats say presents a conflict of interest. Kemp's office has suspended processing 53,000 voter registrations, 70 percent of which are for black Georgians. He did so under the auspices of a 2017 state law passed under his urging, which requires an \"exact match\" between a voter registration form and government documents. If a person's voter registration form differs from government documents \u2014 even by a hyphen or a misspelling \u2014 their registration form is considered suspect. While Abrams has claimed Kemp is deliberately trying to suppress the votes of black Georgians, who typically vote Democratic, Kemp argues the issues with registration forms are due to shoddy work by liberal groups such as the Abrams-founded New Georgia Project, which works to register minority voters. However, the 53,000 voters with pending applications can still vote on election day, if they present photo identification at the polls. On Sunday, President Trump is rallying for Kemp. Vice President Mike Pence stumped for Kemp on Thursday, and criticized the star power Abrams' campaign has attracted. \"I heard Oprah's in town today,\" Pence said. \"I'm kind of a big deal too and I've got a message, I've got a message for all of Stacey Abrams' liberal Hollywood friends. This ain't Hollywood. This is Georgia.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

John McCain is \"doing well\" and \"reflecting at the end on a lot of different things\" as he spends time at home at his Arizona ranch, according to his son-in-law Ben Domenech, a CBS News contributor and publisher of the Federalist.\u00a0 \"He's doing well, he's talking, he's chatty and he's walking around,\" Domenech said Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation.\" McCain is at home spending time with family and friends and performing the duties of senator as he recovers from a procedure related to the brain cancer he is fighting. Domenech told CBS News that the family appreciates all the support and prayers they've received from friends who have come out and met with the senator. McCain's new memoir, \"The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights and Other Appreciations,\" will be released May 22. In a recording NPR obtained and released from McCain last week, the Arizona senator says, \"I don't know how much longer I'll be here. Maybe I'll have another five years. Maybe with the advances in oncology, they'll find new treatments for my cancer that will extend my life. Maybe I'll be gone before you hear this. My predicament is, well, rather unpredictable. But I'm prepared for either contingency, or at least I'm getting prepared. I have some things I'd like to take care of first, some work that needs finishing, and some people I need to see.\" Domenech said the senator has \"lived the life over and over again enough for five or 10 different people,\" adding that he's had a \"pretty amazing run.\" He said that right now McCain is \"reflecting at the end on a lot of different things.\" \"We just appreciate the fact we've had such a good time to be able to spend with him in this moment.\" added Domenech. McCain has stayed occupied in Arizona as much as he can. He told former Vice President Joe Biden when Biden visited the ranch last weekend that he hopes the Democrat won't \"walk away\" from politics, the former vice president told the New York Times. In a new documentary on his life, McCain said he wished he'd selected former Sen. Joe Lieberman to be his running mate in 2008, instead of Sarah Palin. According to the Times, McCain's intimates have informed the White House Vice President Mike Pence should attend his funeral, but not President Trump. The 81-year-old McCain has made a point in recent months to criticize President Trump when he deems necessary -- such as when Mr. Trump congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his election win. \"An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\" McCain said in a blistering statement in March. \"And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country's future, including the countless Russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist Putin's regime.\" McCain has also criticized Mr. Trump's approach to leadership, something he is expected to do in his book. In an excerpt of the book obtained by NPR, McCain discusses the way Mr. Trump addresses refugees -- \"the way he speaks about them is appalling, as though welfare or terrorism were the only purposes they could have in coming to our country,\" McCain writes.",

            "article_content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- South Korea's Kim Jong Yang was elected as Interpol's president on Wednesday, edging out a longtime veteran of Russia's security services who was strongly opposed by the U.S., Britain and other European nations. Kim's election was seen as a victory for the White House and its European partners, who had lobbied against Alexander Prokopchuk's attempts to be named the next president of the policing organization. The U.S. and others expressed concern that if Russia's candidate had been elected, it would lead to further Kremlin abuses of Interpol's red notice system to go after political opponents and fugitive dissidents. Russia accused its critics of running a \"campaign to discredit\" their candidate, calling Prokopchuk a respected professional. Kim's win means he secured at least two-thirds of votes cast at Interpol's general assembly in Dubai on Wednesday. He will serve until 2020, completing the four-year mandate of his predecessor, Meng Hongwei, who was detained in China as part of a wide anti-corruption sweep there. Kim, a police official in South Korea, was serving as interim president after Meng's departure from the post and was senior vice president at Interpol. Russia's Interior Ministry said after the vote that Prokopchuk, who is one of three vice presidents at Interpol, will continue his role in that position. Most of Interpol's 194 member-countries attended the organization's annual assembly this year, which was held in an opulent Dubai hotel along the Persian Gulf coast. Interpol was facing a pivotal moment in its history as delegates decided whether to hand its presidency to Prokopchuk or Kim, who were the only two candidates vying for the post. Based in the French city of Lyon, the 95-year-old policing body is best known for issuing \"red notices\" that identify suspects pursued by other countries, effectively putting them on the world's \"most-wanted\" list. Critics say countries like Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and China have used the system to try to round up political opponents, journalists or activists, even though its rules prohibit the use of police notices for political reasons. The agency faced criticism two years ago when Interpol's member-states approved Meng as president for a four-year term. Amnesty International has criticized \"China's longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad.\" In 2016, Interpol introduced new measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice's compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out. Interpol also says it enhanced the work of an appeals body for those targeted with red notices. Still, member countries can issue requests, known as diffusions, directly to other countries using Interpol's communication system, without going through the centralized Interpol vetting that's in place for red notices. Watchdog groups have urged Interpol to reform the diffusion system too. Bill Browder, who runs an investment fund that had once operated in Moscow, says Russia used the diffusion system against him, which led to his brief arrest in Spain earlier this year. Browder and another prominent Kremlin critic warned Tuesday that electing Prokopchuk- who has ties to President Vladimir Putin- would have undermined the international law enforcement agency and politicized police cooperation across borders. Prokopchuk was in charge of facilitating Interpol warrants on behalf of Russia. A day before the Interpol vote, the White House came out publicly against the election of Prokopchuk, with National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis saying \"the Russian government abuses Interpol's processes to harass its political opponents.\" He said the U.S. \"strongly endorses\" Kim. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was encouraging all nations and organizations that are part of Interpol to choose a leader with credibility and integrity. \"We believe Mr. Kim will be just that,\" he said. Russia, however, secured a win for its ally Serbia on Tuesday when Kosovo's bid to join Interpol failed to garner enough votes at the general assembly in Dubai. The move would have boosted Kosovo's efforts at recognition of its statehood. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008.",

Held November 8-15, the festival includes more than 250 features and short films (including many world, U.S. and NYC premieres), as well as special events, including panel discussions, appearances by noted documentary directors, and workshops for aspiring filmmakers. Among the highlights of this year's festival is the Opening Night feature (a New York City premiere),\u00a0\"The Biggest Little Farm,\" the sweet story of a young couple, and a dog, who decide to chuck their lives in the city and start a 200-acre farm north of Los Angeles. Over seven years, filmmaker John Chester and his culinary writer-wife Molly Chester transformed an arid plot of land that had long ago seen any productivity into the lush, verdant Apricot Lane Farms, home of sustainable agriculture and a panoply of livestock. But it's not all sweetness, 'cause farmers have to deal with predators (coyotes and other varmints), pests (snails taking over their orchards), sick animals, drought, flooding and wildfires, and a million other things. A great introduction to young people who might want to grow up to be farmers, or at least better appreciate what farmers have to go through to grow our food. Screens Thursday, November 8.\u00a0(\"The Biggest Little Farm\" will open in theatres April 5, 2019, distributed by Neon.) Another highlight is the world premiere of\u00a0\"Amazing Grace,\"\u00a0 which features a 1972 performance by Aretha Franklin at a church service in Watts, the recording of which became her best-selling album and the most successful gospel album of all time. Footage of Franklin, intended for a companion documentary, was nonetheless locked away for 40 years, and is only now seeing the light of day. Amen. Of the titles that have been previewed by press time, here are some of the most notable, and recommended:\u00a0  \"Beyond the Bolex\" (World Premiere) is, yes, a film history about how a sturdy 16mm camera introduced in the 1920s revolutionized filmmaking for both amateurs and professionals, but it's also a detective story. Director Alyssa Bolsey delves into her family's archives to uncover the previously unknown story of her great-grandfather, Jacques Bolsey, a Russian refugee who emigrated to Switzerland before coming to America and designing cameras for the U.S. military during World War II, to understand why she was never told of her family's intimate connection to cinematic history.

Screens Thurs., Nov. 8. \"Follow the money,\" they say \u2013 and there's certainly a lot of it in \"The Kleptocrats\" (World Premiere), in which investigative journalists from the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Hollywood Reporter track some of the $3.5 billion that was swindled or laundered from a Malaysian government fund (1MDB), which was then used to finance everything from yachts and Manhattan real estate to a Martin Scorsese movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Political scandals and greed all spill out in this engrossing tale (which is still unfolding; last week the Justice Department announced a guilty plea and indictments against two Goldman Sachs bankers and Malaysian businessman Jho Low in connection with the 1MDB scandal). Screens Friday, Nov. 9.  \"Fire on the Hill: The Cowboys of South Central\"\u00a0(New York City Premiere) tells the inspiring story of horsemen in inner-city Los Angeles who escape from gangs by riding, carrying on the traditions of black cowboys who have been pretty much invisible in the popular imagination of western lore. When the cowboys' stable, the Hill, is ravaged by fire, their displacement and effort to bring back the Hill becomes a unique story of urban renewal, with hay and oats. Director Brett Fallentine and DP Bradley Stonesifer both have great eyes for a story in which mythic western imagery collides with concrete, asphalt and steel. Screens Fri., Nov. 9, and Wed., Nov. 14. (Visit\u00a0fireonthehill.la\u00a0for more details.) \"Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin\" (New York City Premiere) \u2013 She was the grand dame of science fiction literature, though Le Guin, and her readers, would be the first to tell you her writing did not cater to a single genre, or to a preconceived notion of what science fiction is. This thoughtful up-close-and-personal documentary traces the life and career of Le Guin (who died last January), and her uncompromising willingness to speak out about the state of literature (and not just speculative fiction) in the era of Amazon. Screens Sat., Nov. 10.\u00a0(Visit\u00a0worldsofukl.com\u00a0for details.) \"The Smartest Kids in the World\" (World Premiere) builds on the bestselling book by journalist Amanda Ripley, who explored differences in educational practices around the globe to understand why the U.S. had fallen behind so many countries. This engaging film follows four American high school students who travel to South Korea, the Netherlands, Finland and Switzerland to advance beyond what their schools in the States were giving them, and are tested in ways they never expected. Directed by Tracy Droz Tragos (an Emmy-winner for the doc \"Be Good, Smile Pretty\"). Screens Sunday, Nov. 11, and Tues., Nov. 13. \"Exit: Leaving Extremism Behind\"\u00a0(New York City Premiere) is the powerful story of radicals who had been attracted to extremist and nationalist groups and then tried to break away, only to discover that, as with a mob family, it's not really an option. Filmmaker Karen Winther herself had joined a right wing group in Norway when she was a disaffected youth seeking a welcoming family. At first she was OK with the violence, but eventually decided to leave, and with no \"exit programs\" available for former group members, she had to depend on the kindness of a left wing extremist group member to escape. The film also shares the stories of people such as Angela, an American who sought to leave her white supremacist group behind after seeing images of a child victim of the Oklahoma City bombing; S\u00f8ren, a Dane who joined a militant anti-Fascist movement, who today teaches courses on radicalization; David, a Frenchman who was jailed for his participation in an Islamist terror group; and Manuel, a German who can no longer legitimize kicking people in the face now that he is the father of an adorable toddler. An immensely valuable work for anyone wanting to understand the mindset of extremism and the possibility of rehabilitation. Screens Sunday, Nov. 11. (A Women Make Movies release.) The subject of \"Olympia\" (World Premiere) is Olympia Dukakis, the gifted stage and screen actress who, under the watchful eye of filmmaker Harry Mavromichalis, proves herself to be as outspoken and funny as some of her most colorful characters (such as her Oscar-winning portrayal of an Italian matriarch in \"Moonstruck\"). Mavromichalis follows Dukakis (whose youthful vigor puts the calendar to shame) as she recounts her career (including co-founding the Whole Theatre Company in Montclair, N.J.), accepts honors, meets fans in a supermarket, performs a one-woman show, visits her ancestral home on the Greek isle of Lesbos, and talks of the lineage of female power. A thoroughly captivating film, befitting its arresting star. Screens Sunday, Nov. 11.\u00a0(Visit olympiathefilm.com for details.) \"Hillbilly\" (New York City Premiere) is one of the surprisingly few political documentaries in their year's festival, but it's perhaps the most pointed, on several levels. Co-director Ashley York, who grew up in eastern Kentucky before studying journalism in Los Angeles, returns to Appalachia to examine media misrepresentations of the region's people as ignorant, shoeless hicks, and the underlying class and racial divisions of those depictions. While such animus made her embarrassed about her background when trying to advance in her career (woe to whomever does not speak in the neutral, Midwest tones favored by broadcasters), York finds Appalachians proudly defiant about the views of outsiders, but overjoyed for the rare occasions (such as the film \"Coal Miner's Daughter\") when they're treated with dignity. York also seeks to understand why her family, Democrats for generations, had jumped on board the Trump train in the 2016 election, which can be partially explained by the very media and social characterizations of coal country residents that caused stark differences between Hillary Clinton's campaign and that of Donald Trump. Screens Mon., Nov. 12. (Visit\u00a0http://hillbillymovie.com/\u00a0for details.) There have been about 50,000 locals who served as interpreters for American military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Without them the Pentagon would have gotten nowhere. But such collaborations marked these men as traitors by ISIS and the Taliban, putting their lives in jeopardy. \u00a0American lawmakers managed to pass special immigrant visas, to be granted to those who aided American troops, but bureaucracy has meant delays of years for permission to emigrate to the U.S. \"The Interpreters\" (New York City Premiere) follows several such men who are caught in limbo, trying to obtain a safe haven for their families, after risking their lives for a nation that, in the midst of a rancorous political campaign, looks increasingly less welcoming of them. Screens Mon., Nov. 12, and Tues., Nov. 13.  \"Cracked Up\" (World Premiere) is the harrowing story of former \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Darrell Hammond, whose addictions led him to rehab, and to the growing realization that he was suffering from a mental illness (more accurately, a \"mental injury\") derived from his tortured childhood at the hands of an abusive mother. Filmmaker Michelle Esrick tails Hammond, as he revisits the \"SNL\" studio where for years he shared his gift for impressions with a delighted audience; goes on a book tour and, later, performs a one-man show adapted from his memoir; and finally revisits his childhood home, the scene of the crimes. Hammond is surprisingly unguarded in front of the camera when talking about highly personal and painful memories, and his candor makes them all the more shocking and distressing. What is more incredible than having survived is that he did so with his sense of humor intact. Screens Wed., Nov. 14.\u00a0(Visit crackedupmovie.com for details) Winner of the Grand Jury Prize for World Cinema - Documentary at this year's Sundance Film Festival, \"Of Fathers and Sons\" (New York City Premiere) is Syrian-born director Talal Derki's deep dive into the personal lives of radical Islamist fighters \u2013 men, he says, \"who long for war.\" \u00a0Posing as a journalist sympathetic to their cause, Derki was able to gain incredible access to the homes of members of the Al-Nusra Front (one of the competing Islamist groups fighting Syrian government forces). Over the course of two years Derki followed these fathers as they shape their young children into prospective warriors. The disconnect between parental tenderness and cold-blooded training in military-style camps is jarring, while scenes of the kids playing amid the ordnance and ruins of battle are crushing. Screens Thurs., Nov. 15. (Visit\u00a0offathersandsons.com\u00a0for details.) The festival also offers a chance to catch up on some of this year's best documentaries already in release, including \"Fahrenheit 11/9\" and \"On Her Shoulders\" (both in theatres); \"Three Identical Strangers,\" \"RBG\" and \"Won't You Be My Neighbor\" (also available via streaming); and \"Shirkers\" (available on Netflix).

            "article_content": "IZMIR, Turkey -- An American pastor flew out of Turkey on Friday after a Turkish court convicted him of terror links but freed him from house arrest. Andrew Brunson was being flown to the U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, then on to Washington, where he is expected to meet with U.S. President Trump on Saturday.\u00a0   The court near the western city of Izmir sentenced the North Carolina native to just over three years in prison for allegedly helping terror groups, but let him go because the 50-year-old evangelical pastor had already spent nearly two years in detention. An earlier charge of espionage was dropped.\u00a0 The development removed a major irritant in fraught ties between two NATO allies still strained by disagreements over Syria, Iran and a host of other issues.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"I love Jesus. I love Turkey,\" an emotional Brunson, who had maintained he was innocent of all charges, told the court during Friday's hearing. He tearfully hugged his wife Norine Lyn as he awaited the court decision.\u00a0 He was later transported to Izmir's airport and was flown out of Turkey, where he had lived for more than two decades.\u00a0 \"PASTOR BRUNSON JUST RELEASED. WILL BE HOME SOON!\" Mr. Trump tweeted after the American was driven out of a Turkish prison in a convoy. After Brunson was airborne, Mr. Trump told reporters the pastor had \"suffered greatly\" but was in \"very good shape,\" and that he would meet with him at the Oval Office on Saturday.\u00a0 Brunson's release was a diplomatic triumph for Mr. Trump, who is counting on the support of evangelical Christians for Republican candidates ahead of congressional elections in November.  It could also benefit Turkey, allowing the government to focus on an escalating diplomatic crisis over Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi contributor to The Washington Post who went missing more than a week ago and is feared dead after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi was killed in the consulate; Saudi officials deny it.  Additionally, Turkey could now hope that the U.S. will lift tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports, injecting some confidence into an economy rattled by high inflation and a mountain of foreign currency debt.  Friday's ruling followed witness testimony that seemed to partly undermine the prosecutor's allegations and highlighted concerns that Turkey had been using the U.S. citizen as diplomatic leverage. Turkey bristled at suggestions that its judicial system is a foreign policy instrument, and has accused the U.S. of trying to bend Turkish courts to its will with tariffs in August that helped to send the Turkish currency into freefall.  Brunson's release doesn't resolve disagreements over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, as well as a plan by Turkey to buy Russian missiles. Turkey is also frustrated by the refusal of the U.S. to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric accused by Turkey of engineering a 2016 coup attempt.  The court dropped an espionage charge against Brunson, who had faced up to 35 years in jail if convicted of all the charges against him. He was among tens of thousands of people, mostly Turks, who were caught up in a government crackdown after the failed coup.  He was accused of committing crimes on behalf of Gulen as well as Kurdish militants who have been fighting the Turkish state for decades.  Earlier, the court called two witnesses following tips from witness Levent Kalkan, who at the previous hearing had accused Brunson of aiding terror groups. The new witnesses did not confirm Kalkan's accusations. Another witness for the prosecution said she did not know Brunson.  Brunson again denied accusations that his church aided Kurdish militants, saying he had handed over a list of Syrian refugees whom the congregation had helped and adding that Turkish authorities would have identified any terrorists.  \"We helped everyone, Kurds, Arabs, without showing any discrimination,\" he said.  The pastor, who is originally from Black Mountain, North Carolina, was imprisoned for nearly two years after being detained in October 2016. He was formally arrested in December of that year and placed under house arrest on July 25 for health reasons.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had resisted U.S. demands for Brunson's release, insisting that the courts are independent. But he had previously suggested a possible swap involving Brunson and Gulen, who denied he organized the coup attempt.  Other witnesses had not yet testified in Brunson's case and evidence was still not complete, suggesting a rushed effort to resolve the case.  Brunson led a small congregation in the Izmir Resurrection Church. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, with top representative Tony Perkins monitoring the trial, had listed him as a \"prisoner of conscience.\"  While supporters in the United States celebrated Brunson's release, his case overshadowed the predicament of a Turkish-American scientist from NASA and several Turkish workers for the U.S. diplomatic mission who were arrested in Turkey.",

            "article_content": "President Trump takes the stage at the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday after a year in which he heaped criticism on some of the United States' closest allies, while praising the leadership of his \"friend\" North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and on Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 When Mr. Trump gave his memorable first speech at the U.N.G.A. last year, he appeared to mock \"rocket man\" Kim and threatened to \"totally destroy\" North Korea, if necessary. At the time, the president's stark comments made some fear the U.S. could be headed for nuclear war.\u00a0 And yet the backdrop of this year's speech is a much more conciliatory approach to North Korea. Mr. Trump has praised Kim's leadership of the country at such a young age, says they have a good relationship, and even called the dictator a \"friend\" in a radio interview that aired Monday morning with Geraldo Rivera. Mr. Trump said a \"second summit\" with Kim is in the works.\u00a0 Mr. Trump was frustrated when he received such negative reactions \u2014 even from his traditional allies \u2014 for his meeting and subsequent press conference with Putin in Helsinki, Finland, in July, in which he had appeared to believe Putin over his own intelligence agencies. The president was forced to clarify that he does believe Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and the administration has imposed sanctions on Russia, but Mr. Trump has at times still offered complimentary remarks about Putin and defended their meeting.\u00a0 Meanwhile, in recent months Mr. Trump has blasted Canada over its trade policies with the U.S. and declared the European Union one of the country's greatest foes\u00a0over their trade practices with the U.S.\u00a0 \"Well, I think we have a lot of foes,\" Mr. Trump told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Jeff Glor in a July interview. \"I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now, you wouldn't think of the European Union, but they're a foe.\" There remain some things that have changed little since last year's address.\u00a0 On Tuesday, Mr. Trump is expected to take a hard line against Iran, as he did in his 2017 address. Since then, Mr. Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Mr. Trump will have \"strong words\" for Iran's leadership this week. Also missing from last year's address by the president was any mention of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process \u2014 but diplomats in that region fear he could strike a harsh tone against Palestinian officials this year. The administration is frustrated with the Palestinians for not engaging in negotiations. Tensions between the U.S. and Palestinians have remained high since Mr. Trump moved the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem earlier this year from Tel Aviv and more recently cut funding for Palestinian refugees.  State Department officials also believe, CBS News' Kylie Atwood reports, that Mr. Trump will bring up Venezuela in his speech to shame the regime led by Nicolas Maduro.\u00a0 The president spent Monday meeting with other world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and South Korean President Moon Jae-In. Mr. Trump and Moon signed an updated free trade agreement.\u00a0 Mr. Trump is expected to speak at 10:15 a.m., following the president of Brazil.\u00a0 Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Last year at the United Nations general assembly (UNGA), President Trump and Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, met face to face and spoke cheerfully about an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Abbas said Palestinians had met with Trump administration officials more than 20 times, and he saw a possible deal of the century.\u00a0 Now, Abbas says the Trump administration's plan would be the \"slap of the century\" as communication between the U.S. and the Palestinians has largely broken down. According to Palestinian leaders, Mr. Trump cannot be trusted as an honest peace broker.\u00a0 This week at UNGA, there are no publicly planned meetings between Palestinian officials and Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo or Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. There was a push to get Mr. Trump to meet with Abbas this week through Ronald Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, according to one diplomatic source from the region. But so far, nothing has come to fruition.  It is unclear if Mr. Trump's peace plan team \u2014 consisting of White House aide Jason Greenblatt, Jared Kushner and U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman \u2014 will meet with Palestinians in private discussions. Last year Greenblatt met Abbas's son, Tarek Abbas, on the sidelines of the world leaders' gathering. Even at the working level, meetings between the US and Palestinians are now a rarity. Outreach from Trump administration officials has been rejected. A few weeks ago, Majed Faraj, the Palestinian Intelligence Chief, was in Washington and, through a third party, Greenblatt reached out for a meeting. Faraj declined it. While he did meet with officials at the CIA, he refused to meet with one of the primary architects of Mr. Trump's forthcoming peace plan.\u00a0 A handful of Trump administration officials staunchly oppose wasting precious time on trying to secure a meeting between Mr. Trump and Abbas. \"Well the question is, do they want to met with us?\" said an administration official when asked if there were any planned meetings with Palestinians this week. \"I don't think so.\" This standoff has delayed the rollout of any peace plan. The big reveal is now up against domestic pressures - both in the U.S. and in Israel. Regional experts say not to expect the plan before the U.S. midterms or before the Israeli elections early next year. The expectation is that the White house is protecting Mr. Trump from the possibility of getting hammered on the world stage if the plan flops.\u00a0 And Trump administration officials know they need the support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In that vein they do not want to put Netanyahu in a position where he has to take any heat from hardliners for accepting their plan. But regardless of the rollout date, garnering up any Palestinian support seems unlikely.\u00a0 \"The overall approach of this administration has been to weaken the Palestinian negotiating leverage on a range of issues,\" explains Jonathan Schanzer of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which has experts that have advised the Trump administration. \"You are not necessary, we have a plan, we are going to be pursuing regardless of what you think and what you want.\" State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert has expressed frustration on behalf of the administration, repeatedly pointing out that Palestinians have rejected the peace plan before even seeing it.\u00a0 But Palestinian leaders do not like what they have seen from the U.S. in the last year.\u00a0 Actions taken by the Trump administration have revealed its pro-Israeli bias, explain Israeli experts, and has pushed Palestinians away. The list is extensive: The Trump administration moved the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, slashed funding for UN projects that provide humanitarian support to Palestinian refugees, cut off funding for Palestinian hospitals, and forced the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) to close its office in Washington. Despite these policy decisions, and the view of some that the U.S. should barrel ahead without Palestinian support, the Trump peace plan team is still trying to meet with Palestinians. They have told intermediaries for the Palestinians that the administration is going to roll out the peace plan no matter what, and it is in the interest of Palestinians to engage before they no longer have a say, according to multiple sources. The administration hopes that this will get the Palestinians to the table to take a peak at what they are working on. \"They are aware of needs to meet with Palestinians. That is the reason that plan has not come forward. They know if it comes out right now it will get rejected. The Palestinians will reject it,\" says Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute and former advisor to Abbas.\u00a0 But so far, New York does not look like it will be playing host to another meeting between Abbas and Mr. Trump. However, Mr. Trump will be meeting with Netanyahu this week. Even if Abbas and Trump do not meet, one important factor is what Mr. Trump says during his speech on Tuesday. Diplomats from the region would like to see Mr. Trump re-commit the U.S. to a two-state solution. They are fearful, however, that he will come out swinging with anti-Palestinian rhetoric instead that will only fuel the divide.",

            "article_content": "Cybersecurity is \"job one\" for businesses, consumers and governments around the world today, and technology companies are \"the first line of defense,\" according to Microsoft president Brad Smith. \"The security engineers who work at our company \u2013 we have 3,500 of them \u2013 are the first responders when things go wrong. It has fundamentally changed the role we need to play and really elevated the responsibility we need to fulfill,\" Smith said Monday on \"CBS This Morning.\" \u00a0 Asked about the threat China poses to the U.S. in terms of cybersecurity, Smith pointed to the broader picture. \u00a0 \"There are plenty of governments that are worried about each other these days. I don't think that this is a problem that one can use to point at a single government. I think it's one that we need to think about from a global perspective. We need stronger technology, we need people to implement the technology we provide, and we also need stronger international laws in this space as well,\" Smith said.  He noted Microsoft announced last month that it had uncovered new Russian hacking attempts targeting U.S. political groups ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, claims Moscow denied.  Smith also shared more about Microsoft's AI for Humanitarian Action initiative, which is a $40 million program that the tech giant said would save lives. It aims to speed up new artificial intelligence solutions in four areas: disaster response, needs of children, protection for refugees and displaced people, and human rights. Microsoft says AI technology will help anticipate, predict and better target response efforts in these areas. \"You take something like sudden infant death syndrome \u2013 thousands of children die every year but we don't fully understand the cause. Using more data and machine learning, we should be able to make faster progress by working with nonprofits,\" Smith said. \"Take something like a famine \u2013 being able to better predict where famines are going to break out, using machine learning, better data, we can move food to people so that we can avoid the kinds of deaths we read about all too often. Those are just two of many examples where nonprofits have great expertise and data science can make them more effective.\"  He acknowledged the shortcomings in the field of AI technology, however. Wired and Element AI reported only 12 percent of leading AI researchers across the world are women, and 88 percent are men.  \"I think it's a huge issue. Because we need to ensure that artificial intelligence works for everybody,\" Smith said, adding, \"We need people who create artificial intelligence for the world to reflect the diversity of the world. If they don't, they're probably going to miss some problems that we actually need to catch.\"\u00a0 Smith said he wouldn't want to see AI technology deployed \"before it's ready.\"  \"We don't want to see it deployed in ways that might, for example, discourage people from going to a public space, expressing their views. It's important that there be rules of the road. Only if there are common rules for those of us in the United States and around the world are we really going to ensure that this technology is used in a way that I think the public is going to feel comfortable,\" Smith said. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Trump announced Monday evening that he is nominating Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court seat\u00a0being vacated by retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. He said of Kavanaugh that he has \"impeccable credentials and unsurpassed qualifications, and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law\" and referred to him as a \"judge's judge.\" Kavanaugh, in accepting the nomination, talked briefly about the role of judges. \"My judicial philosophy is straightforward,\" he said. \"A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. And a judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.\" Kavanaugh, who clerked for Kennedy, is a well-known conservative jurist who has served on the D.C. Appeals Court since 2006. A graduate of Yale and then Yale Law, Kavanaugh went to work for independent counsel Ken Starr after his time with Kennedy, and assisted with Starr's investigations into President Bill Clinton. He was also the lead author of the Starr Report, which famously recounted Clinton's extramarital affairs in sometimes lurid detail. The 53-year-old Kavanaugh's long march through conservative legal circles was not without its setbacks. After leading the investigation into the suicide of Clinton lawyer Vince Foster, Kavanaugh lost his one and only case before the Supreme Court in 1995 in an attempt to get access to notes exchanged between Foster and his attorney.\u00a0 In 2000, Kavanaugh unsuccessfully attempted to prevent 6-year-old refugee Elian Gonzalez from being returned to Cuba. But later that year, he worked for then-Republican nominee George W. Bush in Bush v. Gore, which ended the Florida recount after the 2000 presidential election. After several years in the Bush White House, which included a time as White House staff secretary, Kavanaugh was nominated for the D.C. Appeals Court. The fight over his confirmation was contentious, with Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin at one point calling him the \"Zelig or Forrest Gump of Republican politics\u2026whether it's Elian Gonzalez or the Starr Report, you are there.\" Kavanaugh was finally confirmed in 2006 and has since made his name as a reliably conservative judge, although he does have his detractors on the right who have questioned his rulings involving contraception and Obamacare. But he has a resume and background that would make it hard for anyone to argue that he is unqualified for the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh's nomination now heads to the U.S. Senate, which is controlled by\u00a0a narrow, 51-to-49 seat GOP majority.\u00a0Democrats are likely to take issue with a number of Kavanaugh's decisions, including ones pushing back on the government's ability to regulate commerce. They are also likely to spend time examining his views on abortion, an issue now- Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0questioned him about\u00a0during his 2006 confirmation hearings. Another potential hurdle for Kavanaugh may be his opinions on how criminal proceedings should apply with regard to a sitting president. Despite his involvement in the Starr investigation,\u00a0Kavanaugh has written\u00a0that Congress should pass a law protecting a sitting president from being subjected to civil suit. In that same paper, Kavanaugh argued that the \"indictment and trial of a sitting president\u2026would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arena\" and that \"even the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation\u2026are time consuming and distracting.\"\u00a0 Given Mr. Trump's current legal challenges, Kavanaugh's opinions on these issues are sure to be intensely scrutinized during his upcoming confirmation hearings.",

            "article_content": "John McCain writes in his upcoming memoir that he's \"not sure what to make of President Trump's convictions.\" He also said that Mr. Trump's \"reaction to unflattering news stories, calling them 'fake news' whether they're credible or not, is copied by autocrats who want to discredit and control a free press.\" NPR published an excerpt and review of the memoir, \"The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights and Other Appreciations,\" which is set to come out on May 22. McCain, 81, is\u00a0battling brain cancer. He writes in his memoir \"maybe I'll be gone before you hear this ... I'm getting prepared. I have some things I'd like to take care of first -- some work that needs finishing and some people I need to see. And I'd like to talk to my fellow Americans a little more, if I may.\" McCain spends much of the memoir reliving many of the most important issues of recent years, including the 2008 campaign, according to NPR. Around page 270, he starts to describe Mr. Trump. After writing that he doesn't know what to make of the president's \"convictions,\" McCain writes that Mr. Trump \"threatened to deliberately kill the spouses and children of terrorists, implying that an atrocity of that magnitude would show the world America's toughness.\" McCain also writes about Mr. Trump's stance on refugees, saying \"the way he speaks about them is appalling, as though welfare or terrorism were the only purposes they could have in coming to our country.\" The most serious comments are reserved for Mr. Trump's tolerance of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying it was \"shameful\" when Mr. Trump responded \"we have killers too\" when warned about Putin. The most defining foreign policy issue for the U.S. right now, McCain writes, is the struggle against Russia. He reminds readers of his feuds with Putin over the years, and that Putin once said McCain had been driven mad by his years \"in a pit.\" McCain also writes about Russian interference in the 2016 election, which he calls Putin's \"revenge\" to Hillary Clinton \"by ordering his trolls and hackers and subcontractors at WikiLeaks to help defeat her.\" McCain told \"60 Minutes\" last year that he and Mr. Trump are \" very different people. Different upbringing. Different life experiences.\" \"He is in the business of making money and he has been successful both in television as well as Miss America and others,\" McCain told Lesley Stahl. \"I was raised in a military family. I was raised in the concept and belief that duty, honor, country is the-- is the lodestar for the behavior that we have to exhibit every single day.\" After McCain criticized Mr. Trump in Oct. -- after McCain's cancer diagnosis -- Mr. Trump said \"people have to be careful because at some point I fight back ... You know, I'm being very nice. I'm being very, very nice. But at some point I fight back and it won't be pretty.\"",

            "article_content": "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -- Israel's Defense Minister has shrugged off threats by Gaza militants who released a video clip showing army officers through the cross-hairs of a Palestinian sniper. Avigdor Lieberman was visiting near the Gaza border Friday when asked if he was worried. He answered \"you see I arrived here and came without a bullet proof jacket even.\" He said he trusts the Israeli army to protect him. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group had released a clip of senior Israeli officers seen through a sniper scope. Gaza's Islamic militant Hamas rulers have called for a mass rally at the border as part of a weeks-long campaign of protests against a decade-old blockade of the territory. Israel is closely guarding the fence and warns it will not tolerate attempts to breach it. On Friday, thousands of Palestinians joined the fourth weekly protest on Gaza's border with Israel on Friday, some burning tires or flying kites with flaming rags dangling from their tails. Four Palestinians, including a 15-year-old boy, have been killed by Israeli army fire on the Gaza border, health officials said. Some 445 Palestinians were injured in the day's protests, including 96 who were wounded by Israeli army fire. Huge black plumes of smoke from the blazing tires engulfed the area, as Israeli troops fired tear gas and live bullets, witnesses said.\u00a0 The protests are part of what organizers, led by Gaza's ruling Hamas group, have billed as an escalating showdown with Israel, to culminate in a mass march on May 15. Organizers have made conflicting statements about whether they plan an eventual mass border breach. Before Friday, 28 Palestinians were killed and hundreds wounded by Israeli troops firing from across the border fence.   Hamas says the protests are aimed at breaking a crippling border blockade that was imposed by Israel and Egypt after the Islamic militant group overran Gaza in 2007, a year after winning Palestinian parliament elections. The marches also press for a \"right of return\" of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to what is now Israel. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced from homes in the 1948 war over Israel's creation. Palestinians mark May 15, the anniversary of Israel's founding, as their \"nakba,\" or catastrophe, to mourn their mass uprooting. \"We will stay here until we reclaim our lands,\" said Ahmed Nasman, 21, speaking in a protest tent camp east of Gaza City, as activists near him prepared kites. \"Every day, we will come here with a new way to resist them,\" he said, referring to Israel. Several thousand protesters flocked to the border area Friday, most gathering in five tent camps several hundred meters away from the border. Smaller groups advanced toward the fence, throwing stones, burning tires and flying kites with burning rags. The kites are part of a new tactic aimed at setting fields on the Israeli side on fire. Most kites were stitched together in the colors of the Palestinian flag. One white kite bore the Nazi swastika. Earlier Friday, Israeli military aircraft had dropped leaflets urging Palestinians to stay away from the fence and warning that they endanger their lives if they follow Hamas directives. The military has said it is defending Israel's border and that its troops, including snipers, only target \"instigators.\" It has also accused Hamas of using mass protests as a cover for attacks. Israel has faced international criticism for its response to the mass marches. Rights groups have branded open-fire orders as unlawful, saying they effectively permit soldiers to use potentially lethal force against unarmed protesters. White House envoy Jason Greenblatt, a member of President Donald Trump's Mideast team, said on social media that Palestinians in Gaza have a \"right to protest their dire humanitarian circumstances.\" Organizers \"should focus on that message, not stoke the potential for more violence with firebombs and flaming kites, and must keep a safe distance from the border,\" said Greenblatt, adding that \"the cost of these demonstrations is too high in loss of life and injuries.\" While Hamas and smaller Palestinian factions have taken a lead as organizers, the mass marches are also fueled by growing desperation among Gaza's 2 million residents. The border blockade has trapped nearly all of them in the tiny coastal territory, gutted the economy and deepened poverty. Gaza residents typically get fewer than five hours of electricity per day, while unemployment has soared above 40 percent. Meanwhile, U.S. actress Natalie Portman, this year's recipient of a prize dubbed the \"Jewish Nobel,\" has pulled out of the June awards ceremony in Israel because of extreme distress over recent events in the country, the Genesis Prize Foundation said. The foundation said it was informed by Portman's representative that the Jerusalem-born Oscar winner \"does not feel comfortable participating in any public events in Israel.\"  ",

            "article_content": "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -- Thousands of Palestinians staged a mass protest along Gaza's sealed border with Israel on Friday, some burning Israeli flags while Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and live bullets from across the border fence. At least nine Palestinians were reported wounded in what was the third mass rally in two weeks.  Since late March, 27 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds wounded by army fire during such rallies. On Friday, most of the demonstrators assembled in five tent camps located several hundred yards from the border fence. Smaller groups moved closer to the fence, throwing stones, torching tires and burning large Israeli flags. Israeli forces fired tear gas, rubber-coated steel pellets and live rounds. The military said that demonstrators hurled an explosive device and several fire bombs near the fence in what it said was an apparent attempt to damage it. Footage distributed by the military showed an area of the fence made up of several layers of barbed wire coils. Protesters stuck a Palestinian flag into the fence and affixed a rope, using it to tug at the coils. One man threw a burning tire into the fence, while another was seen walking nearby with the help of a crutch. Rights groups have branded the Israeli military's open-fire regulations as unlawful, saying they permit soldiers to use potentially lethal force against unarmed protesters. Israel has accused Gaza's Islamic militant Hamas rulers of using the protests as a cover for attacks and says snipers only target the main \"instigators.\" The marches have been organized by Hamas, but large turnouts on two preceding Fridays were also driven by desperation among the territory's 2 million residents. Gaza has endured a border blockade by Israel and Egypt since Hamas overran the territory in 2007, a year after winning Palestinian parliament elections. The blockade has driven Gaza deeper into poverty, with unemployment approaching 50 percent and electricity available for less than five hours a day. The marchers are protesting against the blockade, but are also asserting what they say is a \"right of return\" of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to what is now Israel. Several thousand people gathered Friday at a tent camp east of Gaza City. The camp was decked out in Palestinian flags. At the entrance, organizers had laid a large Israeli flag on the ground for protesters to step on. In the camp, 37-year-old construction worker Omar Hamada said he is protesting to draw world attention to Gaza and get the border reopened. \"We want to live like everyone else in the world,\" he said. \"We came here so the world can see us and know that life here is miserable, and that there should be a solution.\" Hamada was critical of Hamas, saying the group has set back Gaza by decades, but added that \"this is the reality and we have to deal with it.\" Critics argue that Hamas' refusal to disarm is a key reason for the continued blockade. One path toward lifting the blockade would be to have Hamas' political rival, West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, take over the Gaza government, but recent Egypt-led talks on such a deal have run aground. The debate over Israel's open-fire regulations has intensified with a rising number of dead and wounded since the first protests March 30. In all, 34 Palestinians were killed in the past two weeks, 27 during protests. Seven were killed in other circumstances, including six militants engaged in apparent attempts to carry out attacks or infiltrate Israel. Gaza's Health Ministry said more than 1,300 Palestinians were wounded by live fire in the past two weeks. The Israeli military has argued that Gaza militant groups are trying to turn the border area into a combat zone, and said it has a right to defend its sovereign border. It has said that soldiers fire live bullets as a last resort, in a \"precise and measured manner.\" Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party, called Hamas a \"despicable terror organization\" and accused it of exploiting civilians. He said the Israeli military is \"operating against it (Hamas) with determination and according to international law.\" Human rights groups have said soldiers can only use lethal force if they face an apparent imminent threat to their lives. The Israeli rights group B'Tselem said Friday that open-fire policy must not be dictated by worst case scenarios, such as a feared mass breach of the border. \"An order to open live fire at unarmed protesters is manifestly unlawful,\" it said. Another Israeli group, Breaking The Silence, published a statement by five former snipers in the Israeli military who said they were \"filled with shame and sorrow\" over the recent incidents in Gaza. \"Instructing snipers to shoot to kill unarmed demonstrators who pose no danger to human life, is another product of the occupation and military rule over millions of Palestinian people, as well as of our country's callous leadership, and derailed moral path,\" said the statement. The group has been criticized in Israel for publishing often anonymous testimony by current or former Israeli soldiers who have misgivings about their military service and treatment of Palestinians. The five ex-snipers in Friday's statement were identified by name.",

            "article_content": "President Trump, in a long interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, discussed his trip to Pittsburgh, his recent attacks on the media, what he plans to do with asylum seekers at the southern border and the Florida gubernatorial race. Mr. Trump told Ingraham on \"The Ingraham Angle\" Monday night why he was going to Pittsburgh after 11 people were killed in a mass shooting at a synagogue on Saturday.  \"I'm just going to pay my respects.  I'm also going to the hospital to see the officers and some of the people that were so badly hurt,\" he told Ingraham. He said he \"would have done it even sooner, but I didn't want to disrupt anymore than they already had disruption.\"   Since the shooting and a series of bombs sent to prominent Democrats through the U.S. mail, the president has faced an onslaught of criticism over the aggressive tone he takes toward the media when he tweets. He complained that while some in the media associated him with the mail bombs, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, wasn't attacked when one his devotees shot GOP lawmakers practicing baseball, and President Obama was not blamed for the massacre at a black church.\u00a0 \"I was in the headline of the Washington Post, my name associated with this crazy bomber -- Trump bomber or something,\" he said.  \"But I was in the headline... when they got him.  They didn't say -- bomber found -- they talked about Trump in the headline.  Now they didn't do that with Bernie Sanders when he had -- they didn't do that with the Democrats when other people came at -- they didn't do that with President Obama with the church, the horrible situation with the church -- they didn't do that.  They put my name in the headlines.  It's -- when I say \"enemy of the people\" I'm talking about the fake news and it is fake.\"\u00a0 Asked by Ingraham which organization he was talking about, the president said, \"My people understand,\" and he went on to tell an anecdote about a Washington Post reporter who had underrepresented his crowd at a rally. But he later told Ingraham, \"When I say 'the enemy of the people' I'm talking about the fake news and you know it better than anybody.\"  The president also talked about the challenges he faces on the southern border, where two large caravans are making their way from Mexico toward the U.S. His administration announced Monday that thousands of U.S. troops will be sent in response. He told Ingraham that there would not be a \"catch and release policy\" at the border -- \"we're catching. We're not releasing,\" he told her.   If the immigrants are applying for asylum, Mr. Trump said the U.S. would hold asylum seekers until their trial.\u00a0 \"We're going to build tent cities,\" he said.  \"We're going to put tents up all over the place; we're not going to build structures and spend all of this, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars -- we're going to have tents; they're going to be very nice and they're going to wait and if they don't get asylum, they get out.  And very few people -- they don't actually -- if you want to wait, they don't usually get asylum; you know that.\"  The president also talked about the Florida gubernatorial race, calling Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum \"a stone-cold thief\" whose city is \"known as the most corrupt in Florida and one of the most corrupt in the nation.\" He told Ingraham that if Gillum is elected over opponent Ron DeSantis, \"Florida will become Venezuela. It will be a disaster.\" DeSantis, Mr. Trump said, is \"a Harvard-Yale guy\" and said he's \"a very good person.\"",

            "article_content": "MEXICO CITY -- Thousands of Central Americans dreaming of getting to the United States awoke Tuesday to donations of fruit and hot coffee at a sports stadium in Mexico's chilly capital as the U.S. held midterm elections. President Donald Trump has made the migrant caravan a central issue in Tuesday's vote.  Authorities counted more than 2,000 migrants at the Jesus Martinez stadium late Monday, and a steady flow continued into the night. The facility has capacity to hold 6,000, officials said, and four big tents set up for sleeping filled up. Women and children slept apart from the men, who were relegated to concrete bleachers, while the city's central market supplied 3.5 tons of bananas and guavas to refuel the crowd.  Still hundreds of miles from the U.S. border, the migrants dozed on thin mattresses with blankets to ward off the chill in a city some 7,300 feet above sea level -- a big change after trudging for three weeks in tropical heat. Temperatures dropped below 52 degrees Fahrenheit during the night.  Nashieli Ramirez, ombudsman for the local human rights commission, said the city was preparing to accommodate as many as 5,000 people. The lead caravan is estimated to have about 4,000 participants and several smaller groups are trailing hundreds of miles to the south.  Many of the migrants sought treatment for blistered and aching feet, respiratory infections, diarrhea   and other maladies. City officials administered vaccines for tetanus and influenza. The Oxfam charity offered to donate 20 portable toilets.\u00a0 Tania Escobar, a nurse with Mexico City's public health department, said from a medical tent that demand was high for consultations. \"Since we got here, we have not stopped,\" she said.  Melvin Figueroa, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, was with his pregnant wife and two children, 6 and 8. He took the 6-year-old girl to the tent because her eyes were irritated and \"she throws up everything she eats.\"  More migrants were trudging along the highway between the city of Puebla and the capital, trying to hitch rides from passing vehicles.  Mr. Trump has seized on the caravan and portrayed it as a major threat, though such caravans have sprung up regularly over the years and largely passed unnoticed. He ordered thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. The Pentagon said Monday more than 5,100 U.S. troops are now stationed across the border with Mexico. Their mission is to keep\u00a0caravans of Central Americans\u00a0out. CBS News' Mireya Villarreal saw a steady stream of military vehicles in one south Texas border town. Where a week ago there was an empty field, there's now at least 300 troops. The soldiers are there as backup for Customs and Border Patrol agents. Mr. Trump has threatened to detain asylum seekers in tents cities and insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group. In dozens of interviews since the initial caravan set out from Honduras more than three weeks ago, migrants have said they are escaping poverty and rampant violence. Many are families traveling with small children. Some say they left because they were threatened by gang members or had lost relatives to gang violence. Others say they hope to work, secure a good education for their children and send money to support relatives back home.  Alba Zoleida Gonzalez, 48, from Valle, Honduras, said she walked for five hours Monday before catching a ride on a tractor-trailer with about 150 other migrants. Her calf muscles were aching, but that was a small price to pay for the chance at a life better than the one back home.  \"I looked for work, and nothing,\" Gonzalez said, adding that her husband had been robbed and had to hand over everything he made selling crabs so his assailants wouldn't do worse. \"And when one does find a little job, they kill you for the money,\" she said.

            "article_content": "Independent Maine Sen. Angus King questioned the justification for sending thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to anticipate the arrival of migrant caravans from Central America and called the deployment by President Trump an \"overreaction.\" \u00a0 \"If indeed there was an invasion \u2014 which there isn't \u2014 clearly we can defend ourselves. I mean, that's one of the reasons we have a military,\" King told CBS News' Margaret Brennan on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"But using troops in a border situation with asylum-seekers is, I think, not appropriate.\"  \"All the indications are this was an overreaction,\" the senator added, referring to the pre-midterm elections decision by the White House to deploy more than 5,000 active-duty soldiers to the southwest border to help the Border Patrol and National Guard troops already stationed there. The former two-term governor of Maine also pushed back on a series of statements by the president on Wednesday in which Mr. Trump said \"a lot of criminals\" were among the migrants traveling through Mexico for the U.S. The senator stressed that he has \"never seen any evidence\" of the presence of \"bad criminals\" in the migrant caravans.  King, who caucuses with the Democratic Party, said he wants the Senate Committee on Armed Services, of which he is a member, to clarify the \"rules of engagement\" the military units at the border have been issued. On Wednesday, the White House, through a memo signed by chief of staff John Kelly, authorized the troops stationed at the border to use force \u2014 including \"lethal force\" \u2014 when necessary to \"ensure the protection of federal personnel.\" \"It seems to be inappropriate unless there is some serious provocation, which, so far, doesn't seem to be the case,\" King said.  The junior senator from Maine said the committee should also determine how much the operation, originally dubbed Faithful Patriot, has cost the government. \"Estimates range from 75 million to a couple of hundred million dollars for something which by all accounts doesn't seem to be necessary,\" he noted.  During the interview, King also joined the chorus of bipartisan criticism against the White House's pledge to maintain its strong military and economic alliance with Saudi Arabia despite the CIA's conclusion that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the gruesome murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  King, who is also a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, rebuked the president for disputing the assessments of the U.S. intelligence community and for referring to the agencies' findings as \"feelings.\" \u00a0\u00a0 \"The CIA doesn't do feelings,\" King said.  The senator said the economic sanctions that the Treasury Department issued against 17 Saudi officials \u2014 including Saoud al-Qahtani, a close aide to the crown prince \u2014 are concrete evidence that suggest that the Saudi royal was aware of the murder. The White House's statement, King argued, essentially conveyed that the U.S. government was willing \"turn a blind eye\" to Khashoggi's brutal killing because of its important geopolitical relationship with the Saudi kingdom.  \"I think it gives a pass to dictators around the world,\" King said.

When I say a nationalist, I don't like it when Germany is paying 1 percent of GDP for NATO, and we're paying 4.3 percent. I don't like that.\" However, even if nationalism is shorn of any overtly racist overtones, it's still a word with a weighty history.\u00a0 Mr. Trump is hardly the first American political figure to call himself a nationalist. Alexander Hamilton, for example, is sometimes associated with a strain of thought called \"economic nationalism.\" And perhaps most famously, Theodore Roosevelt called described his platform as \"new nationalism\" during his 1912 attempt at the presidency.\u00a0 \"The new nationalism puts the national need before sectional or personal advantage...This new nationalism regards the executive power as the steward of the political welfare. It demands of the judiciary that it shall be interested primarily in human welfare rather than in property, just as it demands that the representative body shall represent all the people rather than any one class or section of the people,\" Roosevelt said in a 1910 speech at Osawatomie, Kansas.\u00a0 At the time, Roosevelt was trying to move the Republican Party in a more progressive direction, which Mr. Trump does not appear to be doing with the current GOP. A more accurate definition of Mr. Trump's sort of nationalism could come from a closer contemporary, Steve Bannon, his former strategist.\u00a0 \"I'm not a white nationalist, I'm a nationalist. I'm an economic nationalist,\" Bannon told the author Michael Wolff shortly after Mr. Trump's election. \"The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f***ed over. If we deliver, we'll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we'll govern for 50 years. That's what the Democrats missed. They were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. It's not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about.\" Like Bannon, Mr. Trump portrayed \"globalism\" as the principal enemy of nationalism in his speech on Monday. But \"globalist\" is a loaded term too, as it considered by some to be an anti-Semitic slur. Broadly speaking, economic nationalism is the belief in protectionist trade policies and the need for a robust domestic manufacturing sector. And although mainstream economists tend to dismiss economic nationalism as warped and counterproductive, Mr. Trump's fondness for tariffs and trade wars would indicate he embraces at least some of its tenets.\u00a0 It's possible that Mr. Trump's belief in nationalism is purely a matter of economic policy. It may also inform his suspicion of American allies and international bodies like the UN. But there are darker definitions of nationalism, the best known of which probably comes from George Orwell.\u00a0 Nationalist and patriot were historically used somewhat interchangeably, although in the modern era American presidents have tended to embrace the patriot label while avoiding the nationalist one. At some point, as Mr. Trump observed, nationalist became something of a dirty word associated with racists, militants, and terrorists.\u00a0 In 1945, Orwell wrote a famous essay called \"Notes on Nationalism\" that tried to create separate definitions for patriotism and nationalism. \"By 'patriotism' I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people,\" Orwell wrote. \"Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige,\u00a0not\u00a0for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.\" For Orwell, patriotism was benign or even good. Nationalism, meanwhile, is \"the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled 'good' or 'bad'\" and \"the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognizing no other duty than that of advancing its interests.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Jake Sullivan is interviewed by CBS News senior national security contributor and host of \"Intelligence Matters\" podcast, Sept. 11, 2018.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Jake, thanks for joining us today. It is great to have you on the show. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So, we served together in the Obama Administration. And I don't want to embarrass you here, but-- I found you to be one of the smartest, most insightful, most impactful participants in national security discussions that I was involved in. I believe you have an extraordinarily bright future in serving our country-- if that's what you want to do. Indeed, it was widely rumored that had Secretary Clinton won, you would have been her choice to be national security advisor. And, putting all that together, Jake, I'm very much looking forward to this discussion. And, now that I set the bar-- sky high (LAUGHTER)-- let's-- let's dig into it. I know you get asked-- a lot of questions about the 2016 election. An-- and I'm guessing that they're not your favorite questions. But allow me to ask two. And-- and I promise I won't ask why you think Secretary Clinton lost or what you guys could have done-- done better. But-- the first of the two questions I want to ask you is if there were important things about the electorate that you learned after the election that you don't think you fully understood beforehand. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Absolutely. I'd go so far as to say there wasn't a single person involved in the 2016 election, including Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and Bernie Sanders, who didn't get surprised by the nature of the electorate in 2016. This is just one anecdote-- early on, Bernie went to a rally. And he saw a whole bunch of people lined up outside. And he asked his campaign manager, \"Who are all these people? Is there a concert in town or something?\" And-- and his campaign manager said, \"No. They're here for you.\" And Bernie was struck by that. Because he didn't quite, I think, getting into the race, expect the spark of populism, of resentment, of \"Blow up the system,\" of, you know, \"Let's have a revolution--\" that fervor-- that spread both through the Democratic Party electorate and the Republican Party electorate. And, you know, I had been working in national security in the years leading up to the campaign. I'd been focused on what was going on over there, not back here. And I didn't fully understand or appreciate the extent to which people felt that everything, our politics, our economy, our society were broken. And that they wanted a fundamental change. Now, that became apparent to me fairly rapidly. But it was still kind of a shock to the system. And it was for everyone who-- who worked on the Hillary campaign in 2016. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: And do you think we're in the same place today? Or-- or has it evolved a bit? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: You know, I think what's happened is that fairly broad-based, bipartisan sense that things weren't working has now been divided into two tracks. One track is the Trump track, which is really laying the blame for all of that at the feet of those other people, whether it's immigrants, or Muslims, or African-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: China. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --Americans, or China, or it's somebody-- or Mexico. It's somebody else. And so, they look at the president and say, \"He's fighting for me against those people.\" So, they kinda think things are working. But there still is that other track, the track that-- Trump actually appealed to some of them in 2016; Bernie appealed to a lot of them. And, frankly, Hillary Clinton also, with-- some of her progressive economic messages, appealed to some, who feel that, fundamentally, the deck is stacked against-- working people, and that the middle class continues to be hollowed out. And I think that sense, that sentiment out there in the public, is still very much alive, and will be on display in the Democratic Primary in 2020. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Second question is I want to ask you, when did the campaign first see what the Russians were doing on social media? Was there a moment? Did the sense of that occur more slowly? Talk about that a little bit. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: It's a great question. It's not a question people ask that often. Because most folks who explore these subjects really look at the hacking as being the core thing, and say, \"Oh, when'd you learn about the hacking?\" and so forth. The answer on the social media is very, very late. Very late in the game. In the closing weeks-- maybe even the closing days, did we really come to appreciate the-- interplay between sort of fake news and misinformation in an active state-sponsored effort on behalf of the Russians. It was not something that, in early September, when we were grappling with the-- the leaks and the hacks, and into October, with the Podesta files-- this was not something we were really focused on. It sort of hit us, and hit us hard, later in October-- in the waning days of the campaign as we started to realize, \"Holy cow, there's something larger going on here.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: You know, my sense is that the same is true of the U.S. government-- have a really hard time getting a firm answer to that question when I-- when I ask somebody who was in the national security community at the time, you know, \"When did you see it?\" My sense is it was pretty late-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: --for them, as well. Right-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah. And it's because, you know, this is the kind of thing that people-- despite warnings from some folks about the potential misuse and abuse of social media, it just wasn't built into our sense or risk and threat in the way that it should have been. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: And, therefore, a sense of what we monitor? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Exactly. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Right? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: And so, at the government level, I'm not a bit surprised that they were a bit late to find out. And, at the campaign level, I mean, w-- we had our eyes focused on attacks from the RNC, Donald Trump, all of the (LAUGH) typical to-ing and fro-ing of a hard-fought presidential election. The idea that there was this whole other campaign under way-- was something that finally struck us. And, when it did, it was-- an absolute eye-opener. And-- and we didn't, even until after the election, come close to fully understanding the depth and breadth of it. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So, looking back on it, did you see the impact on the ground of what the Russians were doing? Did you see it in polling? Was it visible? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Now, looking back, it was somewhat visible. At the time, we didn't know what exactly was going on. I'll just give you one example. We would see, in some of our focus groups and our pollings, spikes in concern about Hillary Clinton's health-- not around the time when-- she had-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: She fell on 9/11-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --she-- she fell and-- right, exactly. But much later, in October. And we thought, \"Well, what is going on there?\" And it wasn't until after the fact that we saw that one of the elements of this social media campaign was to raise questions about whether Hillary had some terrible debilitating disease and so forth. There were other examples like that, where we could see spikes in interest about things that were being-- basically m-- made up out of thin air by the Russians and their echo chamber. But we didn't really know where it was coming from. All we could see was the-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Was the effect? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: The effect, exactly. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Last-- last question before we move on-- your view on how President Obama handled all of this before the election. I know there were huge debates inside the administration. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: And I could only imagine at the time what was going on. Now, at the time, I was much more focused on what had happened with the DNC and what had happened with Podesta than with the social media side. But I, having served in the Obama Administration, could picture who was sitting around the table-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Me too. (LAUGH) me too-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --and how they were debating, and which position each person was taking, and how the president was trying to weigh and consider all the different options. And, frankly, I had a great deal of sympathy for the president. Because I do believe that, if he had come out in a much more forceful way publicly-- that-- he would have ended up creating a circumstance in which Republican leaders in the House and Senate, Donald Trump, and others, would have all cried foul, would have said this is politics. And so-- I feel-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: The rigged election that Donald Trump was-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Which he had already set up-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: --was (UNINTEL), yes. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --in the debates as his narrative in case he lost. So, while I believe that, if the president had come out and spoken much more forcefully, it might have made a difference, it might have had an impact, it is hard for me to criticize the decision he took. Because he was, to a certain extent, boxed in. And-- and-- you, of course, know about the effort to go up to The Hill to get a bipartisan statement out of the leaders of the Congress to say, \"Our country's under attack.\" And Mitch McConnell and others refused to go along with that. And I think that sent a signal to the president that he had to tread very carefully in this area. Pa-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: But the politics were really thick here despite this being an incredibly important national security issue. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Exactly. And, since the ground had never been plowed with the American public that this could be a thing, that you could have this kind of integrated, state-sponsored interference campaign, the president would have been, indeed, plowing new ground. And that would have made the politics even more difficult. Whereas, I think, next time around, in the future-- not with President Trump, but a future president who-- faces a similar situation, they can learn from this and-- react appropriately both publicly and behind the scenes with respect to their messages to Russia and so forth. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: All right, let's take a step to the present, Jake. I want to ask you about the political dysfunction that we're suffering from. You've been around politics for some time now. Where do you think that comes from fundamentally? And how do we get beyond it? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, I think that there's a few different factors at play. I-- as I alluded to earlier when I was talking about the two different tracks or anger and resentment-- and one track being the Trump track, I do think that identity-- is a critical part of the current dysfunction in our politics. That-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Seeing yourself as a white Christian-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Right. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: --versus a Hispanic, as opposed to the traditional approach of seeing yourself as white-collar, blue-collar, or whatever (UNINTEL)-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Precisely. And, in that sense, American civic nationalism, American identity, who we are as a country, is now contested in a way that it has not been in quite some time. And it's contested on the ground that-- a great number of what I consider to be fairly dark forces-- including the president himself, including Fox News and others, are playing on people's insecurities, are telling white working-class Americans, \"There are other people out there who are taking your country away from you.\" And that is ripping at the fabric of commonality that has really held our country together. So, I think that that's an important part of the dysfunction. But then, there's something else happening. Which is, at the leadership level-- there are moves by senior leaders, including people like Mitch McConnell, to shred norms that have kind of held up our democratic system, our checks and balances-- have kept everything in some equipoise. And that goes to everything from not being willing to be a check on the president, basically saying, \"He's wearing the same jersey I'm wearing, so I'm gonna just affirm and approve everything he does,\" and it goes for saying that, \"The other guys, because they wear a different jersey, necessarily, we have to fight tooth and nail to block them from getting anything.\" And we saw that maybe most distinctively with-- what the-- Republican Senate leadership did with respect to Merrick Garland. My experience in Washington is that, once norms start to unravel, it is very hard to-- shall we say, \"re-ravel them\"? And-- so, I'm worried. I don't know what the answer is. And it's not-- this can't all be v-- I think, r-- the Republican leadership has a large portion of the blame to shoulder for this. But this will end up having-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Is there any part on the Democrats hands here in terms of the shredding-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Sure. I mean-- you'll end up being-- yeah, that'll end up being a race to the bottom because of this. That you will see-- you've seen Democrats in the past make moves with respect to the judiciary that were fundamentally partisan and political. Nothing, I think, that rises to the level of what happened to Merrick Garland. But there will be a great temptation on the part of Democrats to say, \"They screwed us; we're screwing them.\" And that-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \"It worked for them.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --that cycle-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \"It worked for them; it might work for us--\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --can go. And, for someone like me, who believes deeply in trying to re-stitch some basic fabric of civility around our politics, especially our politics at the level of Congress, the White House, the judiciary-- we're in a hard place right now. Because, to say, \"Oh, just get along and reach across the aisle,\" you know, a lot of people can look at you and say, \"You're just a chump. Where have you been? What have you-- you haven't been paying attention to what's happening.\" On the other hand, to put on battle armor and say, \"We all have to go to the ramparts and just fight for our side\" is not going to make our country stronger. So, we're going to have to struggle with this balance as we go forward. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: It really sounds like we're in need of an extraordinary leader. Right? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah. And a leader who breaks the mold, who's surprising. I think, almost even more than having traditional leadership qualities, it's gotta be someone who your average person looks at and doesn't just see, \"Okay, that's someone cut from the cloth of a Democratic standard bearer or a Republican standard bearer. It's gotta be someone who can bring a different voice to the process. That doesn't mean it can't be someone who hasn't been around a long time; it could be. But the message they're going to have to carry and the c-- type of campaign they're going to have to run to pull this country together-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Is-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --will have to be different than anyone before. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So, Jake, the reason I'm asking you about domestic politics-- is that I think it's getting in the way of the long-standing non-partisan consensus that America has-- America has a deep interest in being a leader in the world, the leader in the world. Can't tell you how many people around the country say to me, \"You know, we have our own problems here. Let's not fix the world's problems when we have problems.\" I'm sure you hear the same thing. So, I'm wondering if you agree or not that these domestic issues are a threat to what we need to do in the world, I guess, is the first question. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: I do think they are. I think they're a threat to any kind of consensus for the U.S. to have an active engaged foreign policy in which-- we operate on behalf of our enlightened self-interest, and go out and try and solve problems before they come to our shores. But I think it's a challenge in another way, too. Which is, because our domestic model is not working for so many people-- there are other actors and forces in the world, in China, in Russia, and elsewhere, basically saying, \"That system, that open market, democratic, liberal values society, that doesn't work. Our model, the neo-authoritarian--\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Gives them a talking point. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: \"--state capitalism model works.\" And they are taking that case around the world. And not just in the developing world, but in the heart of Europe. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: And do you see that having impact? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: I do think that it is having an impact. I think that there are-- a lot of voices, both within democratic societies and kind of playing into democratic societies, like the Russians did in 2016 here, essentially saying, \"You know what? This whole thing with-- you know, free markets, free societies, civil liberties, do we really need this? Shouldn't we have something else going on here?\" And I think Brexit and-- some of the-- leading voices in countries like France and Italy are playing into this. And, certainly, in Hungary and Poland, you've already seen dramatic turns towards the illiberal. But I think there's one other thing going on, as well. And it didn't start with Trump; it existed before Trump. And that is our capacity to go to other countries to advocate on behalf of what we consider to be our interests-- are reduced when our system's not working, and those countries say to us, \"Well, what are you talking about?\" And just to give you one example, I was with Secretary Clinton in 2011 when we went to Greece at the height of the-- the Greek debt crisis. It was at the same moment when Republican and Democratic leaders couldn't figure out how to avoid the debt ceiling here. And so, Hillary sits down with the Greek prime minister to say, \"You know, we really, you know, need you guys to--\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: \"To do X, Y, and Z.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: \"--do X, Y, and Z.\" And they looked at her, and were sorta like, \"How's that working out for you--\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Right. Yeah, \"Where's your moral authority here,\" huh-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: And we went from Athens, from that-- later in the trip, we were in China, meeting with Dai Bingguo, the state councilor, who basically said-- taunted us, said, \"Hey, you know, what's up with this whole debt-- debt ceiling thing? You know, you guys-- you guys can't get it working. You keep telling us about democracy, but democracy doesn't work.\" And, at a moment when fundamental values are being contested in the world, and geopolitical competition is revolving around how we think about the very idea of a good society, this is a huge problem. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So-- so-- how do you make the case to an ordinary American that this stuff should matter to them? Right? That what's happening in the rest of the world should matter to them, given everything else going on in their lives. And why-- why it should matter to them that we take the leadership role in the world that you and I both think we need to take in order to have a stable world. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: How do you make that case to them? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Look. If I had the right answer on this, if any of us had the right answer on this, we'd be (LAUGHTER) telling everyone, and we'd all-- you know, get on the same song sheet and really sell it. I think we are struggling to figure out how to take something which is abstract and longer-term and make it immediate and real for people. And that is never an easy proposition. But my basic case kinda brings things down to first principles. Which is, what is the purpose of a foreign policy? Fundamentally, it is to defend and protect our way of life. And so, then you have to ask, \"What are the real threats to our way of life?\" Well, if the global financial crisis had turned the Great Recession into the Great Depression, boy, that would have had a real-- would have been a real assault on our way of life. If we had not stopped the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, and it had spread across Europe and to the United States, man, that would have had an impact. What about the irreversible planetary harm of climate change? What about the possibility of large-scale cyber attacks? If you sit down and actually walk through a set of genuine, bona fide threats with people, and then ask the question, \"How do we deal with those things? How do you actually stop Ebola from spreading across the world? Keep a financial crisis from turning into a Great Depression? Reverse, or at least try to reduce the impacts of climate change?\" the answer is the United States needs to build a coalition of countries that are prepared to tackle those things. And that requires that we're out there, in the world, leading the response so that American crops and American cities aren't destroyed by climate change, so that American jobs aren't lost to a global financial crisis, and so on. When you actually sit down with people, as I did on the campaign trail across the country, and have the chance to really play all that out, people start saying, \"Yeah, that completely makes sense to me. I'd buy that.\" But then, they have a question. Which is, \"You guys have been saying a version of this for the last 30, 40 years; and, yet, my life hasn't been getting better. So, why should I keep trusting you?\" And, for that, I think we have to ask ourselves, \"Have we made some basic mistakes around the level of priority we've placed on the wellbeing-- the economic wellbeing of our people in our foreign policy--\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: You know, one of those things I've seen on college campuses is a growing belief, sense, at least questions about the U.S. role in the world historically. And how positive has it really been? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: And I-- you know, I-- I have that conversation with the kids. But it-- it's-- it's-- I see it more and more and more. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Right? Where it's not-- the story's not as positive as-- as I think it is, or as, certainly, I was taught. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah. And-- and part of that-- I teach-- on a college campus. And I encounter this every day. And part of the reason is because the kids who are in college or law school-- or graduate school today, most of them were in elementary and middle school in the 2000s. So, they came of age with Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, with the war in Iraq, and Snowden, in terms of what their sense of the role of the United States in the world is. And all of the many other things the U.S. did, from PEPFAR to Paris climate agreement, and so forth, didn't quite penetrate the consciousness the way that some of those bigger, more controversial headline issues did. So, that's the-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Right. We're-- we're thinking about World War II-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Right. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: --and winning the Cold War and-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Right. Exactly. And they're not-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --for them, that's ancient history. The more recent history of the United States for them is much more challenging. And so, then they use that as the prism to look back at the decades of the Cold War. And are much more likely to cast a bit of a gimlet eye on, you know, \"What-- what is a checkered record?\" And the case that I make to my students is that what actually makes the United States a different country, a unique country distinct from other great powers in centuries past is we do have the capacity to learn from our mistakes and to do better. And, you know, one example I give is, if you look at the history-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Because we're a democracy? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Because we're a democracy-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Because we're-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --and because there's something about the American project uniquely, going back to our constitution, which is a constitution that foresaw amendment and improvement and overcoming some of the sins of our past. And that has been the story of America. And President Obama spoke about that quite eloquently in a speech he gave on American exceptionalism in Selma. And, you know, I-- I think young people are open to that argument as long as those of us who come from a more traditional view about America as a force for good in the world are willing to meet them on their terms by saying, \"Has the United States made mistakes in its foreign policy through every president, Democrat and pub-- Republican? Yes. \"Do we need to even make adjustments from the last eight years, let alone what Trump is doing today? Yes. Okay. Now, let's have a conversation about that.\" But it is a little worrying to me, that-- that the sense of the United States as having aspiration and purpose and drive and thrust in the world is being lost a little bit. And not just among young people. Because older people are being convinced by Trump's argument, which is, \"The U.S. has basically been played for a sucker. And we've shouldered all the burn-- the burdens, and other people have gotten all the benefits.\" And, when you put those two things together, the Trump argument to some older generations and young people who don't buy that from Trump, having a different objection to American foreign policy-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: A little bit more sophisticated, actually-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --you know-- yeah, it's-- it's hard-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, I mean-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: It's-- it creates a t-- it creates some challenges-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Okay, great-- great transition. So, let's-- let's switch to President Trump and his foreign policy. We're almost two years into his term. How would you assess his and his administration's-- and I make a distinction there-- his and his administration's approach to the world? What have they done right? What have they got wrong? What overall grade would you give them? How do you think about that? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: You know, it's a little bit hard to grade them on a traditional curve. Because Donald Trump has basically come in and said, \"Everything about the core tenets of American foreign policy no longer really apply. I'm going to do things totally differently.\" So, in a way, it's like he's-- he didn't even-- participate in the class. He just blew it all up. For him, allies are a net liability, not an asset. For him-- American values are not even a luxury; they're an irrelevance. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Hindrance? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: A hindrance. So that he's much more likely to feel positive towards a dictator or a corrupt autocrat than he is towards-- a fellow democrat-- small \"d\" democrat. For him, the idea of multilateral cooperation is just an opportunity for the United States to get taken for a ride. So, he has unwound all of our efforts to rally the world to solve big problems, whether it's the Iran nuclear program or the Paris-- climate agreement. He has thumbed his nose at our friends. He has coddled our adversaries. And so, from my perspective-- he's missed the thing that has really distinguished the United States, which is this idea that we can be better, safer, and stronger when others are better, safer, and stronger. Because, for him, this is a purely zero-sum calculus, and a dog-eat-dog world's a good thing as long as we're the biggest dog. I think this is fundamentally dangerous-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: And that was an absolutely key principle that we took out of World War II. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Correct. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: And established and-- and built and-- and-- and fed and grew. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Through, you know, taking Germany and Japan, vanquished foes, and helping rebuild them. Or, you know, something you worked on over the course of your career in the U.S.-China relationship. We helped create the conditions of stability and security in East Asia that allowed China to have this remarkable economic rise. So that it's rising, in a way, is not the failure of American foreign policy; it's the success of creating those stable conditions. And Trump, I think, basically says to all that, \"It's nonsense.\" Now, on the other hand-- I would say there are certain areas where we should pause and say-- \"Is Trump onto something?\" He is much more willing-- to push hard in the way that the Chinese and the Russians both push hard on friends and foes alike to try to get to a good outcome. The problem is that it's not actually directed towards anything particularly useful. But I do think-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: In-- in-- in some cases, the motive is the right motive. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Right. And-- and the concept that the U.S. has more leverage to bring to bear to produce outcomes. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: It's how it's done. It is a little-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Right. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: --a little rough around the edges-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Exactly. Exactly. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So, China-- Chinese economic practices, Chinese coercive economic practices would be one of those, in your view? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Right, exactly. That-- that Trump is looking at that and saying, \"You know what? This has been going on for too long.\" And President Obama complained about it, too. And President Bush did, as well. \"And I'm gonna do something about it.\" Now, the way he does something about is-- is, I think, completely flawed and faulty. But the idea that you don't just say, \"Well, we'll nibble around the edges. Or we'll grin and bear it.\" \"We're going to actually do something here.\" I think that's a sensibility, a sentiment that the next commander-in-chief should take up. But combine it with a combination of enlightened self-interest and an actual systematic decision-making process that-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: And some-- and some nuance diplomacy. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah, exactly. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: That reminds me, Jake, you-- you sounded the alarm bell when-- John Bolton was named national security advisor. I think you call him-- you called him ill-suited for the job. How do you think he's doing? Has your view changed? You know, sometimes people, when they get into a job, surprise you. How do you think about that? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: You know, I-- I don't have enough of a view as to what is happening on the inside. But two things that I didn't completely factor in-- when I was analyzing his appointment were, first, the degree to which Trump himself was going to seize the reins of-- of foreign policy, and basically say, \"I'm tired of listening to all these advisors. I'm doing my thing.\" And we saw that prominently on North Korea, where he essentially said, \"I don't want to brook any criticism from you, Bolton, or anyone else on my course of action.\" We've seen it with respect to the trade issues. So, I actually think Bolton has not been able to have the impact on foreign policy that he might have been able to have in the first year of a Trump Administration, when Trump was more willing to listen to people around him. That's one thing I didn't totally factor in. And the second thing is that, as much as I believe that, if John Bolton's substantive ideas about American foreign policy were put into practice, it would put our country in danger, I underestimated to a certain extent how much of a canny bureaucratic operator he is, as well. He's got a career in government. He knows how to maneuver. He knows how to keep principles happy. And I think he's gone into this job and thought, \"Okay, I diverge from the president in some big ways on some big issues. I'm not going to test the limits right now. I'm going to try and settle into the job.\" So, the jury's still out on how this all will play. But those are two things I didn't fully factor in in the story-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: In some ways, he's the-- he and the president are ideological opposites, right? And the president and at heart, is an isolationist. And John's an aggressive interventionist, right-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: And I think that will-- my view is that will affect their relationship at some point. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: And that's why I think Bolton has been sort of careful to not call the question on the divisions between their world views. But sorta, you know, go along, maneuver as we go. But one area that this-- the chickens will ultimately come home to roost is North Korea. At some point along the way, you have to think-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Well, that's-- that's another great transition. So, let's go into some specific issues and on North Korea. We'll start with North Korea. What's your expectation for how this gets played out? We've started a process here. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Right? Oddly, but we've started a process. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: How do you think this plays out? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: You know, it's interesting. I wrote a piece in The Washington Post shortly after this summit was initially announced, where I said what I expected Trump would do is go have some piece of paper that announced some big bargain-- between the United States and North Korea, tout it as a great success, and then not really pay that much attention to what comes next. Kinda just let the process run indefinitely. I think that's more or less what's happened so far. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Without the piece of paper? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, you have the Singapore Declaration, right, that-- Trump held up and said-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Yes, yes, yes-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --even though, on its own terms, it was weaker than previous commitments that North Korea had made to the Bush Administration or the Clinton Administration, he came out and said, \"I have this piece of paper which has solved the North Korea nuclear issue.\" In fact, he went so far as to say thatNorth Korea no longer poses a nuclear threat to the United States. So, I think, from his perspective, it's fine to just have this bump-along now. Because he's had the big summit. He's gotten some w-- extracted some words, even if they're very weak words, from North Korea. And I think, at least for the time being, it's in his interest to downplay any sense that this thing has gone off the rails. The big danger for American foreign policy in all of this, though, is that, in the current posture, North Korea is sitting pretty. Because they now no longer feel the pressure they were feeling before. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: For which the Trump Administration deserves some credit. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: There's now holes in the sanctions. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Holes because why would the rest of the world hop to an American-led maximum pressure campaign when the Americans are saying, \"Hey, we're good friends with the North Koreans now\"? So, the Chinese, the Russians, and others-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Even the South Koreans. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --are unlikely to. And then, there's the South Korea factor. Because, essentially, what Trump has said to-- President Moon-- not in so many words-- is, \"I'm not going to stand in the way of your effort.\" And Moon really wants to drive towards rapprochement and normalization with the north. So, Kim Jong-un still has his nuclear arsenal, has the South Koreans coming to him seeking-- a better relationship, has the Chinese and the Russians now not aligned with Washington, but seeing how they can play this to their advantage vis-\u00e0-vis Washington. And so, it's been all upside for Kim Jong-un. And I don't see how we disrupt that dynamic as long as Trump is continuing to essentially claim his brilliant presidential diplomacy has solved the North Korean nuclear issue. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Same question on Iran. You were deeply involved in the Iran negotiations. I know you're a strong opponent of the president withdrawing us from the deal. Where do you think this goes from here? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Look-- this is one where, unlike on North Korea, where they're, you know, sort of struggling to figure out a way forward, they have a very clear sense of what they want to accomplish with respect to Iran. And it is ratchet up the pressure, not just to a ten, but to an 11, 12, or 13. They use the phrase, \"financial or economic warfare against Iran.\" And I think their first goal would be to actually bring down the government-- and see-- see what happens next-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: (UNINTEL) policy is regime change? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, I don't think the stated policy of -- is regime change. I think the stated policy is pressure for pressure's sake. And then, you ask, \"Well, what are the potential outcomes of pressure for pressure's sake?\" Well, it would be great if the government fell. But, even if the government doesn't fall, at least Iran will be weakened and have some of its--its claws or its-- its wings clipped. But, even if that doesn't happen, well, at least-- we're not-- continuing a policy that the Trump Administration believed was providing some kind of credibility or-- authenticity to the Iranian regime. So, for them, the actual outcome is a little bit less important than to be seen to be just cranking the pressure as much as they humanly possibly can. And-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Do you think the Iranians come back to the negotiating table? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: I think it's going to be very difficult for President Rouhani to authorize a negotiation with the Trump Administration right now-- on the basis of what Pompeo has laid down as the lines that we're insisting on. Which is essentially as maximalist as you can possibly get. That being said, I do think, at some point, there will probably be some back channel discussions between the United States and Iran. And the real question is, after Mike Pompeo went out publicly and said, \"We will only accept a deal with these 12 elements,\" and it's worth your listeners going and looking at those 12 elements, because what they essentially add up to is surrender by the Iranians. The real question is, will the United States back off of that, and say, \"Actually, we're prepared to do an Iran deal round two, that might look similar to/slightly different from Iran deal round one.\" I just don't know if Bolton, Pompeo, and others in the Trump Administration are willing to do that. So, my guess is there'll be some discussions between U.S. and Iran, but you will see no progress between now and 2020, because each side is gonna wait the other side out. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Maybe the-- the-- the most important question-- maybe the most important national security challenge we face-- China. I think the relationship between Beijing and Washington is probably the most important bilateral tie for how the world's going to look over the next 25 to 50 years. How would you assess the China issue-- quotes around that, \"the China issue\"? And what should our strategic approach be to dealing with it? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: You know, it's interesting. One thing that has really struck me about the policy conversation in Washington over the last year or two around China is how dramatically the center of gravity has shifted. So, when I came into the Obama Administration, in 2009, the kind of consensus among China watchers was still this idea that we had-- should seek to encourage Beijing to be a responsible stakeholder, a phrase that-- that Bob Zoellick, a Bush appointee used-- first in 2005. And that idea that somehow we could work in a cooperative constructive way with China and Beijing to produce coexistence over time was pretty much I wouldn't say the absolute consensus, but was the main line of reasoning of China hands. In short order, we have shifted from coming-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: From-- it's-- it's fascinating how dramatically it has changed-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Yeah. Exactly. And how quickly. And how-- it didn't kinda stop halfway in the middle. It went from like coexistence all the way across to competition, you know. And-- and robust, vigorous, you know, pretty intense competition, at that. And I'm a little nervous that maybe it's we pushed it too far, in a way. I have always been someone who believes that we have to take a firm line with the Chinese-- in areas in which they have-- are acting aggressively, or they're flouting basic international norms, like the wholesale theft of U.S. intellectual property. And I do believe that China, under Xi Jinping, does believe that it should be advancing a neo-authoritarian model for the rest of the world, not just for itself. And he said as much. But I also think that we are going to have to work with this country on some of the biggest challenges that we face. And we've got to find a way to manage this in a mature, predictable, stable way, so that we don't end up with the self-fulfilling prophecy that intense competition turns into confrontation, potentially turns into conflict. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: There's no doubt, right, that our shift to a competitive view of this relationship affects how they think about, as well, right-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Right. And then-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So, it reinforces-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: And then, a cycle-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: It self-reinforces. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: And then, it comes back to us. Exactly. And so, I-- I don't want to-- come in sounding like, you know, \"Let's just go back to the responsible stakeholder model.\" That's not going to work. We're in a different mode. China's in a different mode. And-- and we have to stand up and fight and compete. I fully accept that. But I think we do also, at the same time, not have to throw the baby out with the bath water as we make adjustments to our policy-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Isn't the fundamental deal, at the end of the day with Beijing-- and I don't know if it's possible anymore-- I-- I once thought it was the fundamental deal being, \"We will-- we, the United States, will give you more room in the world to exert influence, because you are a rising power, if you play by the rules of the international order.\" That's the basic deal to be had. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: So, what the-- this is, I think, why the consensus has shifted so swiftly and so dramatically, is that a great number of China hands, Republicans and Democrats alike, have basically concluded the Chinese will never accept that deal. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Hmm. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Therefore, time to head into competition mode. I ha-- I happen to believe that we're not going to get exactly that deal. Because the Chinese view the current system, even with adjustments to give them more voice, as a threat to their own system. But I would argue that you-- we should think about an alternative framework for the relationship between the U.S. and China, and for China having to participate and play by a certain set of rules, that it does not simply take off the table the idea of an international order, and just get down to competition. Which is where I th-- I worry that-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: We're heading -- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: --the extreme lines are heading. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: If your former boss, Joe Biden, were to run for President in 2020, would that be enough to lure you back to Washington and back into the political game? (LAUGHTER) Oh, I know that's the farthest thing from your mind at the moment-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Getting-- getting back into the political game right at the moment is-- is not particularly appealing. But I tell-- I will tell you what-- Joe Biden not only is an incredible national treasure-- but he has, I think, all of the attributes to basically expose everything that is wrong with the current president and to show this country a way forward that will pull people together. So-- I have the greatest respect for him. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: You saw it in his eulogy of-- of-- Senator McCain-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Exactly. And-- and you've seen it in the way that he's conducted himself over the last two years. And he's somebody who's been around Washington a very long time; but, in a way, has never really been of Washington. Because he's never really gotten too far from where his roots were. And-- you know, as for my own participation in politics, I'm the-- the only silver lining in the dark, dark cloud of the Trump presidency is that I get to be at least semi-retired for a while. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Okay. Jake, thanks so much for your time. It's been great having you on the show. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 JAKE SULLIVAN: Thanks for having me. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 * * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "PARIS -- French prosecutors filed preliminary charges Thursday against far-right leader Marine Le Pen for tweeting brutal images of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) violence, in a new blow to a woman long seen as the face of Europe's anti-immigrant populism. The prosecutor's office in the Paris suburb of Nanterre said the charges were issued Thursday for \"distribution of violent images.\"\u00a0 If the case eventually reaches trial and Le Pen is convicted, she could face up to three years in prison and 75,000 euros ($90,000) in fines.  Le Pen's December 2015 tweets showed executions by ISIS extremists, including the killing of American reporter James Foley. She posted them in the wake of the November 2015 ISIS attacks on Paris, as she accused the government of not doing enough to protect France.\u00a0 Three images posted referred to ISIS and were captioned, \"Daesh is THIS!\" One image showed the decapitated body of Foley, the BBC reports. Le Pen later deleted that image amid outcry and insisted she didn't know the victim's identity.\u00a0 Another image showed a man in a jumpsuit, in a cage, being burned alive. The third image showed a tank running over a man in an orange jumpsuit, reports the BBC. Le Pen didn't comment publicly on Thursday's preliminary charges, made possible after the French parliament lifted her immunity from prosecution in the case late last year. Lawyer Rodolphe Bosselut, representing Le Pen in the case, confirmed the charges but wouldn't comment.\u00a0 It's one of multiple legal cases targeting Le Pen or the National Front. In one high-profile investigation, she and the party were given preliminary charges last year over accusations that they used European Parliament aides for party activity while they were on EU-financed salaries. She denies wrongdoing.  The charges come as Le Pen's party is in crisis after she lost her presidential bid last year. Le Pen plans to propose a new name for the National Front at a congress later this month, in an apparent effort to distance it from past problems and stigma. The party could also end the honorary presidency of Le Pen's father and National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, as part of a protracted family feud.  Marine Le Pen's French-first, Islam-skeptic nationalism resonated widely in the wake of Donald Trump's election and Britain's vote to leave the European Union. But French voters overwhelmingly favored pro-Europe centrist Emmanuel Macron in the May 2017 election, and Le Pen was a distant runner-up.",

            "article_content": "Read more transcripts from Face the Nation\u00a0here.\u00a0\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: Today on FACE THE NATION: a week of hits and misses for the Trump administration, as the North Koreans vow complete denuclearization following their summit with the South Koreans. At a rally last night in Michigan, the president had a hard time trying to downplay expectations of his upcoming meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm not going to give you what's going to actually happen, because we don't really know. AUDIENCE: Nobel! Nobel! TRUMP: That's very nice. Thank you. That's very nice. Nobel. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: I just want to get the job done. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: Despite that optimism, there's chaos in the Cabinet, as the nominee for VA secretary, Ronny Jackson, withdrew after shocking allegations of mismanagement as the White House physician. Plus, Scott Pruitt took fire from Congress for possible spending and ethic violations at the EPA. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If I were the president, I wouldn't want your help. I would just get rid of you. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: But there is good news for the president, as Mike Pompeo was confirmed as secretary of state and set off on his first official trip as America's top diplomat. We will hear about the plans for that face-to-face meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un from the president's new national security adviser, John Bolton. South Carolina Republican Trey Gowdy will weigh in on congressional investigations into Russian collusion and Cabinet officials. Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson will also be here. Plus, we will have plenty of political analysis. It's all ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan. We have got a lot to cover today. And we begin with President Trump's new national security adviser, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. Welcome to the program. JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Glad to be with you. BRENNAN: You're just about three weeks on the job now. You have the South Korean-led diplomatic breakthrough. Do you believe that Kim Jong-un is ready to negotiate away his weapons, or is just he trying to soften his image? BOLTON: Well, I don't think we know at this point. I think, if he has made a strategic determination that North Korea would be better off without nuclear weapons, then I think we have got something to talk about, and I think the president would be eager to capitalize on the opportunity. But I think it's clear we're here where we are today because of the pressure that the Trump administration has put on North Korea, economic pressure, political, military pressure. I think this is widely recognized. President Moon of South Korea himself has repeatedly said the opportunities for the Olympics, the opportunity for the North-South summit woman not have occurred without this pressure campaign. The prime ministers and Japan and Australia, the president of France, the chancellor of Germany have all said the same thing. So, that's why we're here now. And I think it's up to the North Koreans to show us that they really do intend to give up nuclear weapons. BRENNAN: Well, arguably, North Korea also walks in, in a position of some strength, economic weakness perhaps, but this nuclear program is further along than any past administration has encountered. BOLTON: Well, because of the mistakes of 25 years of past administrations. BRENNAN: But is it a requirement that Kim Jong-un agree to give away those weapons before you give any kind of concession? BOLTON: I think that's right. I think we're looking at the Libya model of 2003-2004. We're also looking at what North Korea itself has committed to previously and, most importantly, I think going back over a quarter of a century to the 1992 joint North-South denuclearization agreement, where North Korea committed to give up nuclear weapons and committed to give up uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing. Now, we've got other issues to discuss as well, their ballistic missile programs, their biological and chemical weapons programs, their keeping of American hostages, the abduction of innocent Japanese and South Korean citizens over the years. So, there's a lot to talk about. BRENNAN: Will the U.S. accept this invitation from the North to inspect their nuclear site, when it's taken down in May, as promised? BOLTON: Well, we will see exactly what that is. The... BRENNAN: Well, the South says that's what the North promised. BOLTON: The North -- well, it's interesting, because we have been to this place before. I hope it's a sincere commitment by the North. But I will just read you a sentence, if I may. \"In a gesture demonstrating its commitment to halt its nuclear weapons program, North Korea blew up the most prominent symbol of the plutonium production Friday. The destruction of the cooling tower bore witness to the incremental progress that's been made in U.S.-led, multilateral efforts to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\" June 27, 2008, \"New York Times.\" Now, the self-same \"New York Times\" last month reported that President Trump is going to have difficulty with North Korea because new satellite evidence suggests that North Korea is expanding its plutonium production. So, we want to see real commitment. We don't want to see propaganda from North Korea. BRENNAN: You haven't seen such action so far? BOLTON: We have seen words so far. BRENNAN: No dismantlement. BOLTON: We have seen words so far. BRENNAN: Continued development. BOLTON: They said that they are going to give up nuclear testing and ballistic missile testing. They haven't conducted any recently. That's true. That could be a very positive sign, or it could be a sign that they have reached a level of development where they don't need testing now. We have seen this in other contexts as well. President Trump is determined to see this opportunity through, hopeful that we can get a real breakthrough. But we're not naive in the administration, and a lot is going to ride on this meeting with Kim Jong-un. BRENNAN: So there are these headlines that -- from South Korea saying that Kim Jong-un would abandon his weapons if the U.S. promises not to invade his country. Are you going to make any kind of promise like that? BOLTON: Well, we've heard this before. This is -- the North Korean propaganda playbook is an infinitely rich resource. BRENNAN: But it puts the burden on the United States. BOLTON: I don't think it does really. I think that if you look at the decision to give up nuclear weapons as a real strategic decision that North Korea has to make, what we want to see from them is evidence that it's real, and not -- not just rhetoric. In the case of Libya, for example -- and it's a different situation in some respects -- those negotiations were carried out in private. They were not known publicly. But one thing that Libya did that led us to overcome our skepticism was that they allowed American and British observers into all their nuclear-related sites. So it wasn't a question of relying on international mechanisms. We saw them in ways we had never seen before. BRENNAN: That sounds like you want inspections before any kind of sanctions relief. BOLTON: Well, I think it would be a manifestation of the strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons. Doesn't have to be the same as Libya, but it's got to be something concrete and tangible. It may be that Kim Jong-un has some ideas, and we should hear him out. BRENNAN: According to CBS' reporting, Singapore is the preferred location for this meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. When will you make this determination on location, and how important is it? BOLTON: Well, I think that when the president is ready to announce it, he will announce it. We're still working on the location. We're still working on the date. BRENNAN: He said within the next few weeks, three to four. BOLTON: The president is ready to go on this, and so we're eager to come to conclusion, so we can do all the logistical planning. But I don't want to preempt any news that he may want to make. We just have -- we don't have it pinned down yet. BRENNAN: Is there any update on the three Americans that are being held prisoner in North Korea? Are they essentially going to be held hostage to the success of this diplomacy, or do they need to be released before the president walks into that room? BOLTON: Well, I don't want to get into the discussions that we have had. I will just say this. These three Americans are at the top of the president's mind. And in exchanges between normal nations, these people wouldn't even be held. So, I think North Korea should look at this very seriously. BRENNAN: This is a gesture, though, that they're not required to take before the meeting? BOLTON: It would be a demonstration of their sincerity. We're waiting to see what their decision is. BRENNAN: Can you tell us anything about their status? BOLTON: Well, I would rather not get into the discussions at this point. But it's very much on the president's mind. BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about this other big decision upcoming on the Iran nuclear deal. You have been very public in the past about your skepticism. And it's led diplomats in private to say and to question whether you are going to be a broker here who could actually present another option to the president. If the Europeans can pull off a side deal, a fix to the nuclear plan, do you actually think it's possible to keep it? BOLTON: Well, it's the president's decision. I mean, one thing people have to keep in mind is that I have changed roles here. When I was a private citizen, I could say whatever I wanted to. It was a great luxury. But that... BRENNAN: In March, you said, \"It cannot be improved and it is simply blue smoke and mirrors to think we can fix it.\" That wasn't that long ago. BOLTON: So, I don't -- what I said was what I believed. I don't back away from them. But that's not my job now. My job is to give advice to the president. He will make the decision. It's his call. I'm the national security adviser, not the national security decision-maker. And, in fact, on the Iran nuclear deal issue, I have presented him with options. And I will continue to do it right up until he makes the decision. I think that's critical for the proper functioning of the national security system. And it's my obligation to do that. BRENNAN: So, if Secretary Pompeo can crack a side deal, you're open to accepting it and to keeping the Iran nuclear deal? BOLTON: I think it's a question of the president being open to make the final decision. It's the job of his advisers to give advice. He's the decision-maker. BRENNAN: So, if the U.S. put sanctions back on Iran on May 12, does that mean the U.S. has withdrawn? BOLTON: Well, there are a variety of things that could happen. And I don't want to get into a discussion of what the hypotheticals might be, but certainly withdrawal is under consideration. The president has said this repeatedly. His views on the nuclear deal have been uniform, consistent, and unvarying since the campaign of 2016. And we will see what happens. BRENNAN: Well, the world is watching. Thank you so much. BOLTON: Glad to be with you. BRENNAN: John Bolton, thank you for coming on FACE THE NATION. Hope to have you back soon. BOLTON: Thank you very much. BRENNAN: Last week, there were several new developments in the multiple investigations related to Russian influence in the 2016 election. Former New York Rudy Giuliani met with special counsel Robert Mueller in his new role as a member of the president's legal team. Giuliani has promised to put pressure on Mueller to end his probe quickly. In a phone interview with FOX, the president reversed himself on whether he'd get involved into his own Justice Department's investigations into allegations that former FBI Director James Comey leaked classified information when Comey gave memos detailing conversations with the president to his attorney and a friend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I have decided that I won't be involved. I may change my mind at some point, because what's going on is a disgrace. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released the results of their investigation into Russian ties to the Trump campaign. Their verdict? No collusion. Committee Democrats released a rival report saying the Republicans refused to investigate all possible leads and accused them of a cover-up. As for the president, he responded to the week's developments in a freewheeling performance before supporters in Michigan last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Look how these politicians have fallen for this junk. Russian collusion. Give me a break. (BOOING) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Hey, what about Comey? Do you watch him on the interviews? (BOOING) TRUMP: What about Comey? What about Comey? (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: And to hopefully help us answer that question, what about Comey, we turn now to Congressman Trey Gowdy. He's on the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees and is also the head of the House Oversight Committee, making him a busy member of Congress. So, we appreciate you being here on set. Former FBI Director James Comey today said on NBC the House Intelligence Committee investigation that you worked on was just a wreck and the report was just a political document. How do you respond? REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: This way. I have more confidence in the executive branch investigations than I do congressional. I wouldn't say it's a wreck. The witnesses we talked to, no one said that they had any evidence of collusion. And I participated in almost every one of those interviews. And I'm the one who asked the questions. So, from the standpoint of where these matters are best investigated, I don't think it's in Congress right now, for myriad of reasons, one of which, Margaret, is when you start with a conclusion, which Adam Schiff did in March of 2017, you have evidence of collusion, and then you never, ever share it with anyone, that investigation is not likely to turn out well. BRENNAN: You have asked Adam Schiff for specific evidence that he refused to hand to you? GOWDY: He doesn't have it. So, he can't give me what he doesn't have. Adam, before we ever started, said he had evidence of collusion -- and this is exactly what he said -- more than circumstantial, but not direct. Let's lay aside the fact that there is no such thing as more than circumstantial, but not direct. There are only two kinds of evidence. BRENNAN: There's also no such thing as collusion, you point out in this report, as a legal term. GOWDY: There's not. It's conspiracy, which is why I always ask, do you have evidence of collusion, coordinating or conspiracy? The crime is conspiracy. If there's collusion, even if it doesn't rise to a level of a crime, my fellow citizens want to know that. It's important to know that, even if it doesn't rise to a level of a crime. But there was no evidence of collusion, coordination or conspiracy that we found. BRENNAN: Well, you do write about a number of ill-advised meetings, the Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr. You issue a number of recommendations and warnings about the system simply not being sort of braced for any kind of attack or attempted attack here. So, what should people make of this? GOWDY: Well, the real disappointment is, we were supposed to look at four things. What did Russia do? With whom, if anyone did they do it? What was the U.S. government's response in 2016? And then the issue of the dissemination of classified material. Unfortunately, the focus was always on that second prong, not just what did Russia do, but with whom, if anyone, did they do it? I asked a lot of tough questions on the Trump Tower meeting. I was tougher on Steve Bannon than any Democrat was. So, when the transcripts come out, I think my fellow citizens are going to see the Republicans did take it seriously. But when all you're interested in is seeing the president indicted, then, yes, that investigation is not going to turn out well from a bipartisan standpoint. BRENNAN: And you never got to interview Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser? GOWDY: We don't get to interview anyone who is currently under indictment. Their lawyers should be fired if they allow us to interview them. BRENNAN: So, it's a fair point to make, though, because clearly the Mueller investigation has a broader set of people they're talking to. But the president, when he looks at your report, feels vindicated. Are you saying he should not? GOWDY: I will be careful how I phrase this. No report -- the best we can do is say what we learned. I can't say what's in the universe of witnesses we have not talked to. And I have always maintained I am awaiting the Mueller investigation. They get to use a grand jury. They have investigative tools that we don't have. Executive branch investigations are just better than congressional ones. So, we found no evidence of collusion. Whether or not it exists or not, I can't speak to, because I haven't interviewed the full panoply of witnesses. BRENNAN: Do you plan to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, who shared personal memos that he said were unclassified? The president now say they were classified and accuses him of a crime. GOWDY: Congress is not well-equipped to investigate crime. I have complete confidence in Michael Horowitz, who's the inspector general. That's who investigated Andy McCabe, and then he made a referral to the Department of Justice. I trust Mr. Horowitz to investigate. I have never accused Comey of committing a crime. I have accused him of doing some things that I don't agree with. But in terms of accusing someone of a crime, a member of Congress shouldn't do that. And I have not done it. BRENNAN: But does House Oversight have questions for the FBI? GOWDY: Pardon me? BRENNAN: Does your committee, House Oversight, have questions for the FBI? GOWDY: I think Judiciary would be the better place to ask those questions. And we should, but we should not interfere with ongoing I.G. and/or criminal probes. BRENNAN: The president said this week during an interview on FOX that he was disappointed with the Justice Department and he might change his mind and be involved. Do those comments concern you? GOWDY: It depends on what he meant by it. If a president says that the Department of Justice is going to advance my agenda -- I think President Obama had certain ideas with respect to criminal justice reform that Attorney General Holder did a very good job of carrying out. If that's what he meant, that I want a Department of Justice that is going to advance my legislative agenda, there's nothing wrong with that. I think there ought to be -- I have said it a number of times. Prosecutors should have all the resources and all the independence and all the time they need to do their jobs. And my position has not changed. BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you as well about your committee's investigations or possible investigation at the EPA. Scott Pruitt testified this week. What is the status of Oversight's probe into his behavior? GOWDY: We got documents Friday. We are scheduling witness interviews. The natural chronology of investigations to me is, gather the documents, schedule the witness interviews, and then draw your conclusions at the end. What usually happens with Congress is, we draw our conclusions on front end, and then we go in search of whatever evidence we want to validate that previously held wrong conclusion. We're going to do it the way I'm used to doing it, gather the documents, interview the witnesses, and then share it at the appropriate time. BRENNAN: So, any timeline on that? GOWDY: Things don't ever move as quickly as I would like them to. We had a little bit of hiccup scheduling the witness interviews. But I think we have reached a meeting of the minds, that we are going to interview those witnesses. And we got permission Friday to start scheduling those. BRENNAN: Over at the VA, there was a lot of talk this week about a personnel matter, although there are bigger issues with the agency itself. But Dr. Ronny Jackson, who is the president's physician, was the nominee, no longer is. He's still a government employee. He's been accused of all sorts of things, allegations of handing out prescription drugs, fostering a hostile work environment, possibly drinking while on duty. Do you think, as chairman of House Oversight, that this should require looking into? GOWDY: I think some of those allegations do warrant being investigated. I don't think you want members of Congress deciding whether or not the prescribing of Ambien is within the course of a professional medical practice. In fact, I can't think of anybody less well-qualified to decide whether Ambien should be prescribed than a bunch of lawyers. So, that's a medical license issue. Hostile work environment would be some combination of the Veterans Affairs Committee and House Oversight. But this is a pretty good example of reaching the conclusion, and then going in search of the investigation. And investigations that your viewers should have confidence in do it in the reverse order. You go gather the facts, and then you level the allegations. That's just not what is done in our political environment BRENNAN: But there have been questions about background checks, repeated questions, with other members of the president's staff as well. On this front, he's still the president's physician. If any of these things are true, wouldn't that warrant looking into? GOWDY: And I would hope that it -- to the extent he has a security clearance, it should have already been investigated. If it deals with his medical license, there's an entity that should investigate that. If it deals with a hostile work environment or things intrinsic within that office, we have an inspector general. There are number of entities who can, within their jurisdiction, conduct an investigation. The notion that all of that should be done by Congress, particularly whether or not medicine should be prescribed, I really can't think of anybody you would less want making that decision than members of Congress. BRENNAN: Congressman Gowdy, always good to talk to you. GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. You too. Thank you. BRENNAN: We will be back in one minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: We're joined now by President Obama's Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who is now a private citizen, coming back here to Washington to talk to us. JEH JOHNSON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Thanks for having me, Margaret. BRENNAN: Good to have you on the show. I want to pick up with where we're talking with Trey Gowdy about this House Intelligence Committee investigation into Russian interference and collusion with the Trump campaign. You were at the helm at Homeland Security when all of this was happening. In the report, DHS is faulted for not designating election systems as critical infrastructure until January 6, 2017. Why did you wait until two months after the presidential election to do that? JOHNSON: Well, first, I think it's unfortunate that the committee's report was basically Republican only. There was not a bipartisan consensus. And for the committee that oversees our intelligence community, that's really unfortunate. And I think Trey would agree with that. You're correct. I designated election infrastructure to be critical infrastructure on January 6, 2017, just as we were leaving office. I had raised the idea with state election officials in August 2016. And there was a lot of misapprehension about what that would mean. They thought it would mean a federal takeover, binding operational directives. And I told them it was not. It was something that was voluntary in nature, if the states seek our assistance. But the priority then was to basically bring the horses to water and to encourage the states to come in and seek our assistance. So we put the issue of critical infrastructure aside, which was becoming a hot-button issue. And, in the end, we did get 36 states to come and seek DHS's cybersecurity assistance. Then, after the election, I came back to the issue and designated election infrastructure critical infrastructure. I'm glad I did it. We should have done it years before. And I'm pleased that Secretary Kelly, after I left and he came in, basically reaffirmed that designation. BRENNAN: Well, there's a lot to take into here in terms of whether we're prepared now and actions that were taking. But we have to take a quick break. So, stay with us. And we will be right back, more with former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: We will have a lot more FACE THE NATION coming up. And if you miss any of the show, you can watch the rebroadcast of FACE THE NATION on our digital network, CBSN, at 11:00 a.m. and then again at 6:00 p.m. Eastern time every Sunday. And, of course, you can go to our Web site at the FACETHENATION.com. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan. We continue our conversation with Obama administration Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Jeh, let's pick up where we were talking about this House Intelligence Committee report into alleged collusion and Russian meddling in 2016. JEH JOHNSON, FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: Yes. BRENNAN: In the report, which you've acknowledged you wish it weren't just a Republican paper because it is so serious. JOHNSON: Uh-huh. BRENNAN: But the conclusion is that the intelligence community should immediately inform presidential candidates when they discover a legitimate counter intelligence threat to the campaign and notify Congress. And they fault the administration for not doing that when you were in office. JOHNSON: Well, I think that's a legitimate recommendation. Any time a campaign is the target of a hack, a cyber hack, the campaign itself should be aware of that so to take proper action. BRENNAN: Why weren't they? Why wasn't the Trump campaign? JOHNSON: Well, I -- I believe that it's the case that at various points along the way, the right people were informed. Certainly the DNC was informed of what we saw and what we were seeing at the time. The FBI and eventually DHS was working with the DNC. But I -- I agree, that there should be a more methodical way of doing this. And this was not the first time, by the way, in 2016 that a campaign had been infiltrated in some way by a cyberattack. And typically law enforcement and DHS will work with a campaign to make sure they take corrective action. You'd have to ask the FBI about the relationship with the -- the interaction with the Trump campaign. But I -- I don't argue with the recommendation BRENNAN: You've testified publicly that when the administration did decide to make public evidence they had of Russian interference attempts, October 2016, one month before the election -- JOHNSON: October 7, 2016, yes. BRENNAN: That's -- you -- you fault the media for not paying enough attention to it -- JOHNSON: Correct. BRENNAN: Because of the \"Access Hollywood\" report coming out at the same time. JOHNSON: Uh-huh. BRENNAN: But doesn't the administration bear some responsibility for not detailing it more, doing more background and sharing more information with reporters? JOHNSON: Well, actually, the House Intel report, I think, does a decent job of laying out all the different considerations that went into that attribution. And we had to declassify a lot of very sensitive intelligence to get to that. And any time you do that, you have to be concerned about compromising sources and means. And so we said, as much as we could say at the time without seriously jeopardizing our sources and means. And this statement itself was pretty blunt and pretty straightforward by saying that at the highest levels of the Russian government, there was an attempt to interfere with the ongoing political campaign. A number of us thought it was very, very important that we tell the American voters what was going on at the time before the election. And then, after the election, we came back in much greater detail to tell the American public exactly what happened. BRENNAN: You wish that alarm bell had been a little louder? JOHNSON: I wish that the alarm bell had been heard by more people. As you point out, the \"Access Hollywood\" video was released the same day. And the speculation over the next several days was whether or not candidate Trump was going to drop out. And our statement was literally below the fold news that day. BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about James Comey, your former colleague, former FBI director, his new book. He writes about you in it and a phone call you made to him telling him to be, quote, very careful when he briefed President-elect Trump about this so-called Steele dossier. JOHNSON: Right. BRENNAN: Why were you thinking? Why were you telling him to be careful? JOHNSON: Well, first, Jim has been a friend for almost 30 years from the days we were federal prosecutors together. And it's actually the case in Washington that when you're in a very senior position, like FBI director or secretary of homeland security, it's a lonely place and very few people, north of you, or south of you, or sitting right next to you are going to take the time to warn you if they think that you're about to do something that is treacherous, perhaps a mistake. BRENNAN: Did you think it was a mistake? JOHNSON: I was very concerned when I heard the plan for the director of the FBI to one-on-one brief Mr. Trump about this dossier. Jim and I had discussed over time the Hoover era history of the FBI. My only grandfather, and Jim knows this, who was a sociologist, has an FBI file of several hundred pages. So Jim and I talked about the history of the FBI. And he and I literally -- he literally finished my sentence when I said, there's a fine distinction, Jim, between telling somebody just so you know and telling somebody just so you know and don't mess with us. And I was concerned that the president-elect was going to hear the latter and not the former message. And Jim understood that. And I think he did his best. BRENNAN: Would you have done the same thing if you were in Comey's position? JOHNSON: That's a good question. I was not in the FBI director's position. But I was concerned about what he was about to do. And felt, as a friend, that I should talk to him, because I had met Mr. Trump during the campaign and during the transition. BRENNAN: And you advised otherwise. All right, well, Jeh, thank you very much for coming on and responding (ph). JOHNSON: A pleasure to be on. BRENNAN: We'll be right back with our political panel, so don't go away. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: It's time now for some political analysis. And we're joined today by David Nakamura. He covers the White House for \"The Washington Post.\" Susan Page is the Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today.\" Jamelle Bouie is the chief political correspondent at \"Slate\" and a CBS News political analyst. And Jonah Goldberg is a senior editor at \"The National Review,\" and the author of \"Suicide of the West: How the Rebirth of Nationalism, Populism and Identity Politics is Destroying American Democracy.\" So, David, how late were you at the White House Correspondents Dinner last night? DAVID NAKAMURA, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Actually, I made it through the whole thing, Margaret. BRENNAN: You did? NAKAMURA: Yes. BRENNAN: Wow. NAKAMURA: Yes, it was quite a moment. You know, look, I've been at a number of these and there's -- she's not -- Michelle Wolf's not the first comedian to -- BRENNAN: This is -- OK. NAKAMURA: Give a -- to make some of the, you know, sort of, you know, forward type of jokes that were made yesterday. But it was awkward. I was at a table -- at \"The Washington Post\" table and Congressman Mark Meadows, a big Trump supporter, you know, a very -- a very hard conservative and he was -- he and his wife were not really reacting, trying to keep a straight face, when these things were happening. And so was -- you know, the rumor in the room was notable for the reaction even journalists had to some of the things that were being said. BRENNAN: Because of how harsh some of the jokes were? NAKAMURA: How harsh. I mean it was -- I mean I think the -- I think, look, I think the focus the journalists, including myself, is that this is supposed to be a celebration certainly of the journal -- the work that's done. There are student scholarships. It's something that, you know, we're talking about the First Amendment and that's what is to be celebrated. Sometimes I think these things can go over and sort of overshadow that. BRENNAN: Susan, you used to head the White House Correspondents Association. You know, when the Trump campaign held this rally, which was kind of counter programming, out in Michigan, the announcement said that the Correspondents Dinner is for the fake news media to toast themselves and the president said why would I want to be stuck in a room with a bunch of fake news liberals who hate me. Did last night buttress that narrative? Did it change it at all? SUSAN PAGE, \"USA TODAY\": I think any time you can have a spit screen and you have the president attacking the press and next to it you can have a journalist dinner with a comedian attacking the president in the very critical way the comedian did last night, that that is -- that is re-enforcing a narrative that is not helpful to us. And the White House Correspondents Association does a lot of good work for the journalists who cover -- who are on the beat every day in terms of access and other issues. But this -- and we've had awkward dinners before, no question. But this is a different time. This is a time when this week a poll came out, done by Quinnipiac, that showed a majority of Republicans say the press is an enemy of the American people, not a defender of democracy. And that is an impression that we need to do everything we can to shows that that is not true and that is not the case and that we're motivated not by partisanship but by a search for the truth. BRENNAN: Jonah, you -- you talked broadly about, you know, identity politics and populism and nationalism in your book. Where does this piece of it fit in, this narrative about the media? JONAH GOLDBERG, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": Yes, I think -- look, I'm not a huge fan of the Correspondents Dinner. I've been to a bunch of them. I think one of the problems is that it feeds into a narrative -- since that's the word of the morning -- that is really useful to populists to say, hey, look -- you know, once it started becoming sort of like an East Coast version of the Oscars, with the red carpets and what -- who are you wearing and all of that kind of stuff, I think the Washington press corps kind of lost track of itself. And I'm someone who has dinged President Trump often for his narcissism. The institutional narcissism that was on display last night from the Correspondents Dinner I think was a gift to President Trump. The crudeness towards Sarah Huckabee Sanders was a gift to the White House. It lets them double down on their, either elites are persecuting us story line. And it was -- I think it was a really bad note for the Washington press corps. BRENNAN: Jamelle, some of the push back from comedians and others has been, well, the president had made personal attacks on people in the past and there hasn't been the same sort of horror by people in the administration that was expressed last night. Is that a fair defense or is this sort of bringing everyone down in terms of what the benchmark for behavior should be? JAMELLE BOUIE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I think you could say it's a little bit of both. I think it is fair to note that the president has -- is vulgar, is vulgar, has insulted private citizens. The president famously could not bring himself or infamously could not bring himself to condemn white supremacist protesters, which I considered to be vulgar. So given that, it's sort of funny to see defenders of the administration say, well, hold on, these jokes were too much given who they either work for or who they are defending. I do want to make a larger point about sort of the press and its relationship to the American public and sort of the distain for the press, which is, I hope we can avoid some presentism here, that the press's problem of legitimacy with the public goes back decades. This is a long-term problem. It is a function both of mistakes made by the press corps and of an active campaign of de-legitimization against the press. And so to think that something like this dinner encapsulates or represents the problem, I don't think is quite true. I agree with Jonah's criticisms of straight up the spectacle of it all, but this problem of press legitimacy goes back a long time and I think we should be careful not to think of it solely in terms of events like this. BRENNAN: David, the president's nominee to run the VA, Ronny Jackson, his personal physician, withdrew this week in -- amid a number of very detailed allegations about his behavior, drunkenness, et cetera. The president, last night at his rally, had this to say. I want to play this sound bite about the senator making some of these allegations. The sound bite's not there. Let me read it to you. Jon Tester of Montana started throwing out things that he's heard. Well, I know thing about Tester that I could say too. And if I said them, he would never be elected again. NAKAMURA: He's trying to make this an issue the way that Tester handled this. But I think the bigger issue here goes back again to Dr. Ronny Jackson. The amount of unsourced allegations that were sort of put out there I think was -- is now being found to -- not all these things are being found to have been true about what was said about Ronny Jackson. We don't know the extent of what was true, what wasn't true. But I think Trump's trying to make this an issue for Tester and sort of -- and make it a partisan issue, even though I think the bigger question was, you know, how much vetting did the White House do about this candidate and what were his real credentials on management, you know, beyond sort of even the personal conduct because he -- this is a doctor who did get high marks from President Obama in his administration, a bipartisan administration, but he doesn't have any management experience. And this is a really troubled agency. And for Trump, it's an important domestic priority. So if he can sort of make this a sort of a gotcha about Democrats sort of trying to undermine him, I think that's what he's going for. BRENNAN: Susan, should we expect the president to be campaigning out in Montana? Does this now change the race? PAGE: You know, he -- I'm sure Republicans hope he is because that's a state that went with him in a big way. But, you know, six months from next Tuesday is the midterm election and I think that there are those in the White House who are concerned that the president is not aware of even what peril he stands, if the House turns -- is controlled by the Democrats after the November midterms or even the Senate, how his life is going to change in terms of investigations and subpoenas, much less passage of legislation. And I think there is an effort by those close to the president to give him a wake-up call about campaigning in Montana, about adjusting some of his behavior and some of his rhetoric to help endangered Republican candidates in a lot of -- in a lot of races where you might not expect Republicans to be in trouble BRENNAN: Speaking of some populism here, I want to come to both of you on this. But, Jamelle, I think it's the first time Kanye West's name has ever been said on FACE THE NATION, but he and the president had a back and forth this week. The president praising him and saying that Kanye has performed a great service to the black community by praising President Trump. And that prompted an online exchange about whether black people have to be Democrats. This is another artist, Chance the Rapper, out saying this. What do we make of this? And I ask you because the president's talking about it. BOUIE: Right. Right. I think that the best lens to take for this -- take to this is to use it as sort of a way to begin to understand political dynamics within the African-American community. I think there's -- there's a -- there's this idea of it because a large majority -- or the overall majority of black Americans vote for Democrats just reflects sort of broad liberalism within the African-American community. But it's more that for black Americans, and this has been true basically during every single period of American political history where they could participate fully or even partially, kind of a central judgment black Americans are making with regards to the party system is, which of the two parties is going to hurt us less? And then voting decisions go from there. And so there are a lot of conservative black Americans. There's conservativism and everything is different than white Americans, but they're still conservative. But they don't vote for Republicans in this moment because they don't feel that the Republican Party is looking out for their best interest. Six years ago it was the reverse. So, that's -- for me, that's my takeaway. A political science lesson, political history lesson about black political behavior. BRENNAN: Jonah, what do you make of this? GOLDBERG: Well, first of all, I just -- I resent having to have a strong opinion about Kanye West one way or the other. Similarly with Shania Twain, right? BRENNAN: Right. GOLDBERG: Who said that she would have voted for Trump, but she's Canadian. So -- and why are you talking about this in the first place? I think one of the problems that we have in our politics now is that not only is our sort of lifestyle being politicized, our partisan -- our partisan affiliation is being invested with huge meaning. But our politics is being life-styled. The high walls between sort of what is considered sort of the entertainment world, you know, as I think I've said on here before, Donald Trump kind of broke the blood brain barrier between politics and entertainment and it seems that everything is now flooding in. And a lot of us just want sort of save harbors where not everything has to be about either Donald Trump or politics in general. And it doesn't seem that's the way the culture is going. NAKAMURA: We're talking about it, though, because Trump talks about it. I just noted quickly that, you know, Trump has 50 million Twitter followers on his personal account. He retweeted the Kanye West signed MAGA cap on that account. The president, that same day, had said he wanted pictures of Mike Pompeo's visit to North Korea put out in the public, but when those came out, it was the official White House account with only 17 million followers that retweeted that. So I mean we can see what's on Trump's mind. BRENNAN: It is. And, as I said, first time Kanye West has ever been mentioned on FACE THE NATION. NAKAMURA: We're making history. BRENNAN: We'll be right back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: We want to take a close look at Friday's summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy file this report from Seoul. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN TRACY, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It was just one step, but it made history. Kim Jong-un became the first North Korean leader to cross the border into the South. Then, a diplomatic dance. As Kim invited South Korean President Moon Jae-in to step back across the military demarcation line into North Korea. That was the first of several unexpected moments as South Korea rolled out the red carpet for its nemeses from the North. The two leaders seemed to form an instant rapport. At one point, Kim Jong-un said he would no longer interrupt President Moon's speech with early morning missile launches. Of course those weapons and the North agreeing to get rid of them was the goal of the summit. But there was no talk of how or when or what North Korea would demand in return. Kim Jong-un declared he wants peace and prosperity and an official end to the Korean War. But all of that rosiness is competing with reality. President Moon, a former human rights lawyer, is negotiating with a brutal dictator known for some of the worst human rights abuses on the planet. TRACY (on camera): For now, the South Korean are giving Kim Jong-un the benefit of the doubt, hoping he is a different and more honest North Korean leader. He did show some evidence of that at the summit, even acknowledging that the roads in his country are in such terrible shape he'd be embarrassed if President Moon had to travel on them. (END VIDEOTAPE) BRENNAN: That was CBS News correspond Ben Tracy reporting form South Korea. We're joined now by Ian Bremmer. He is the president of the Eurasia Group and is also the author of a new book, \"Us Versus Them: The Failure of Globalism.\" Ian, good to have you here. I want to start on the news of the week with North Korea. Moon Jae-in seems to have totally changed the topic. We're not talking about military strikes. Now we're talking about diplomatic breakthroughs. IAN BREMMER, EURASIA GROUP PRESIDENT: That's right. And so, first of all, big win that the United States and the Trump administration were able to push the North Koreans to this point. Both carrots and sticks, right, offering a summit, not talking about human rights, but also saying, you don't get this right, we're going to squeeze you really hard, maybe military strikes. The Chinese got to the table first, right? That's all (INAUDIBLE). But, you can't talk about pre-emption military strikes if the Chinese and the South Koreans and the North Koreans are all engaged in summitry and making peace. And that is exactly what's happening right now. So if Trump wants to have the meeting with Kim Jong-un and declare that this is a great breakthrough and it's an historic win, and no other president can do it, he can do that. But the idea that Trump's going to be able to force denuclearization right now, he's lost a significant piece of his leverage. BRENNAN: What did you make of National Security Adviser John Bolton, who was on this show and repeatedly mentioned the Libya model as what they want to see happen with North Korea? What does that mean for our audience? BREMMER: Well, what it means for the North Koreans, they know what the eventual outcome of the Libyan model was, which is Gadhafi gave up the ability to put together nuclear and chemical weapons and he ended up dead. And if you are Kim Jong-un, the idea of denuclearization, right, is -- is one that is almost unconceivable for any analyst given Saddam Hussein, given Gadhafi, also given Iran. One other thing that's really interesting to watch on the Iran deal, clearly Bolton, private citizen, wants it dead. Bolton, national security advisor, on your show, saying, let's see what the president's going to say. But, you know, that's a self-imposed deadline, May 12th. Kim Jong-un is -- the meeting is after that. I think there's a lot of pressure on Trump right now. Yes, he can rip it up, but don't rip it up before. Give Macron and Merkel a chance to go back. They said that they can work on something else, something additional, maybe on ballistic missiles and the rest. Let Trump have a chance to blame them for failure, then rip it up, but first get your deal done with the North Koreans. BRENNAN: Buy yourself more time. BREMMER: Right. BRENNAN: I want to talk about your book here, \"Us Versus Them.\" It's a fascinating read, but you really lay out a pretty damning vision of where the world is headed and the various structural issues that you say we're not talking enough about. That populists aren't the problem, they're the symptom of the problem. BREMMER: Yes, I have a hard time saying that Trump is the fault of the -- a more divided country than I've ever experienced, especially because it's not just in the U.S. It's across all of the advanced industrial democracies in the world today, except for Japan, where they have no immigrants and the population is shrinking, right? We have big economic issues where a lot of people feel left behind by globalization. Big social and cultural issues where a lot of people feel left behind as we welcome in more immigrants. We have big security issues where enlisted men and women and their families feel left behind because the United States is sending them to wars that fail. They come back, a lot of them broken. Veterans Administration doesn't work. We don't treat them as heroes. And now we have technology that's not only displacing more workers than globalization ever did, but also dividing us in terms of what we do and don't watch, who we listen to, who we follow and who we like. That's structural. That's why Trump won. That's why Bernie Sanders was who he was. That's why Merkel just got destroyed in her last election with the (INAUDIBLE). That's why the Italians had the worse outcome for the established political parties since World War II. I mean, only Macron has won of the globalist and he almost didn't make it for two -- into the second round because of historic wins by the far left and the far right in France. In America we think everything's about us, but we recognize we're not so unique here. This is happening all over the world. We have to stop with it's all about Trump. You can get rid of Trump. We're not going to impeach him probably, but he's going to go after four or eight years, you're not going to fix any of these problems. BRENNAN: It is a really fascinating political analysis and it's one that I recommend you have a tall drink, and not of water, with because it is -- you highlight a lot of really key issues that we should be talking about. We've got to leave it there. Ian, thank you for coming on the show. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

Steve King for controversies about his views on race and ties with people linked white nationalism, CBS affiliate KCCI Des Moines reports. Both Reynolds and King are Republicans. \"I think that Steve King needs to make a decision if he wants to represent the people and the values of the 4th District or do something else, and I think he needs to ... he needs to take a look at that,\" Reynolds said at an event Tuesday in Ottumwa, Iowa. Reynolds' criticism comes after\u00a0The Weekly Standard\u00a0released a tape last week that they say shows King, an eight-term congressman who won re-election last week, calling immigrants \"dirt.\" King said the video was taken out of context, and called it a \"leftist lie.\" The Weekly Standard is a conservative magazine. John Kennedy, King's spokesperson, said to KCCI in a statement, \"Congressman King loves Governor Reynolds, is thankful to her for signing his Heartbeat Bill into law and notes that they are birds of a feather because they won by similar margins.\" Before last week's elections, King faced criticism for retweeting a British neo-Nazi and endorsing a white nationalist Toronto mayoral candidate. He denies supporting white nationalism.\u00a0 Several of King's corporate contributors said they'll no longer donate money to him. Purina Petcare, part of Swiss-based food conglomerate Nestl\u00e9 S.A., followed Land O'Lakes and Intel in vowing to end campaign contributions to King.",

            "article_content": "PARIS \u2014\u00a0President Trump paid tribute Sunday to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I as he and dozens of other world leaders commemorated the 100th anniversary of the end of \"a horrible, horrible war\" that marked America's emergence as a world power. \"We are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\" Mr. Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried. \"It is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\" he said. The Veterans Day speech came a day after Mr. Trump was criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles outside of Paris Saturday because rain grounded the helicopter he had planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House chief of staff John Kelly, went in the president's place. The speech was the final stop of the president's brief trip to Paris to commemorate the anniversary. Earlier in the day, he joined more than five dozen leaders gathered on a rainy day at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the base of the Arc de Triomphe a century after guns fell silent in a global war that killed millions. Bells tolled across Europe's Western Front and fighter jets passed overhead to mark the exact moment the devastating war came to a close. But Mr. Trump, a leader who has proudly declared himself a \"nationalist\" and advocated an \"America First\" approach, stood out at a memorial ceremony that focused on international cooperation. The president and first lady Melania Trump traveled separately from most of the other presidents and dignitaries, who had gathered earlier at the Elysee Palace and traveled to the ceremony by bus. And Trump was not present as the other leaders arrived, walking side-by-side in a somber, rain-soaked line holding black umbrellas as bells finished tolling. They had arrived a few minutes late, missing the exact moment \u2014 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 that four years of fighting ended. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols for the presidential motorcade's solo trip down the grand Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which was closed to traffic. But at least one topless woman breached tight security, running into the street and shouting \"fake peace maker\" as the cars passed. She had slogans, included the words \"Fake\" and \"Peace,\" written on her chest. Police tackled the women and the motorcade continued uninterrupted. The feminist activist group Femen later claimed responsibility. The ceremony included a speech by French President Emmanuel Macron aimed directly at the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe. With Mr. Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron warned against the dangers of nationalism and said the \"ancient demons\" that caused World War I and millions of deaths are growing stronger. \"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\" he said, adding that, when nations put their interests first and decide \"who cares about the others\" they \"erase the most precious thing a nation can have ... Its moral values.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly branded himself a \"nationalist,\" despite criticism from some that the term has negative connotations. At a news conference last week, Mr. Trump defended his use of the phrase. \"You know what the word is? I love our country,\" he said, adding: \"You have nationalists.  You have globalists.  I also love the world and I don't mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first.  We have a lot of problems.\" Sitting several seats away was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who arrived at the ceremony separately as well. Putin shook Mr. Trump's hand, flashed him a thumbs-up sign and patted Mr. Trump's arm as he arrived, and Mr. Trump offered a wide smile. Mr. Trump's eagerness to get along with the Russian leader \u2014 in spite of Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and numerous other aggressive moves \u2014 has alarmed America's European allies, who view Russia as a growing threat. National Security Adviser John Bolton had said at one point that Mr. Trump would meet with Putin during the visit. But Mr. Trump later said he would instead sit down with him formally later this month at a world leaders' summit in Buenos Aires. The two both attended a lunch Macron hosted for world leaders following Sunday's ceremony. But Putin was quoted by the state-funded Russian broadcaster RT saying they didn't end up meeting because they didn't want to \"interrupt the schedule.\" France was the epicenter of World War I, the first global conflict. Its role as host of the main international commemoration highlighted the point that the world mustn't stumble into war again, as it did so quickly and catastrophically with World War II.",

            "article_content": "A Canadian crowd laughed derisively at former White House strategist Steve Bannon on Friday and police made 12 arrests as protesters delayed the start of a controversial debate featuring Bannon and conservative commentator David Frum. Toronto Police tweeted 12 people face various charges and two officers suffered minor injuries, one was hit with a stick and another was punched in the face. The debate was delayed for about a half hour and Bannon was interrupted by a protester during his opening statement. Many in the crowd of 2,700 at the Munk debate groaned and laughed at Bannon when he said he hasn't seen a bad decision by President Donald Trump yet. When Bannon earlier called it a very tough crowd, one audience member responded \"No, smart.\" \"Trump's economic nationalism doesn't care about your race, your ethnicity or color,\" Bannon said to a jeering crowd at another point. The protester that interrupted the debate unfurled a banner that read \"No Hate. No Bigoty. No Place for Bannon's White Supremacy.\" When one audience member loudly clapped for Bannon, he quipped, \"Thanks Mom.\" Last month New Yorker Editor David Remnick withdrew an invitation for Bannon to speak at the magazine's festival this month after facing widespread criticism. That set off a fierce debate about whether it was better to challenge or to shun Bannon. Bannon thanked the people of Toronto and the organizers for having him and the protesters outside for exercising their freedom of speech rights to protest. Frum and Bannon debated whether \"The future of Western politics is populist, not liberal.\" Frum argued populism offers nothing but anger and fear and said he had faith in voters. \"I know the fear that many feel,\" Frum said. \"This is not the first time that democracy has faced thugs, and crooks and bullies and would be dictators and those who would seek to build themselves up by tearing others down. This is not the first time that people have puffed themselves as the wave of the future. They were wrong then and they are wrong now.\" Frum called the rise in populism the most dangerous challenge that liberal democratic institutions have faced since the end of communism. \"It's not a question of whether populism is on the rise and whether populism is going to be the political future,\" Bannon said. \"The only question before us: Is it going to be populist nationalism or populist socialism?\" Bannon played a central role in the 2016 campaign of Mr. Trump. Bannon said next week's midterms are critical test of the populist movement but said they are just in the first inning of it. He believes the Republicans will hold the Senate but it will be a dogfight for the House. Watch special election coverage live on CBSN on\u00a0fuboTV.\u00a0Start a free trial",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump says the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \"are over\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump is levying tariffs on the metals, starting Friday, on imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. His administration is also renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. The White House has said the U.S. tariffs -- 25 percent duties on steel and 10 percent on aluminum shipments from Canada, EU member states and Mexico -- are necessary to safeguard U.S. national security. \"After a period of cooling, the Cold War for Trade entered a new phase of escalation this week with the Trump Administration reasserting tariffs on trans-Atlantic partners for steel, and China over intellectual property,\" Benjamin Salisbury and Cory Palmer of B. Riley FBR wrote in a research report.\u00a0 They added that the conflict could be \"a longer drawn-out process characterized by serious but limited sector-specific skirmishes.\" In announcing his country's response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was \"inconceivable\" that Canada \"could be considered a national security threat to the United States,\" noting that U.S. fighter planes and tanks contain Canadian steel. Trump said of NAFTA, \"Earlier today, this message was conveyed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada: The United State (sic) will agree to a fair deal, or there will be no deal at all.\" Trudeau is calling the tariffs \"totally unacceptable,\" suggested they would alter the relationship between the two countries, and has announced plans to levy tariffs on $12.8 billion in U.S. exports. House Speaker Paul Ryan says he disagrees with the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. Ryan was among several leading Republicans in Congress critical of Thursday's action. Ryan says that the administration's decision \"targets America's allies when we should be working with them to address the unfair trading practices of countries like China.\" Ryan says there are better ways than tariffs to help American workers and consumers. He does not specify those measures, but says he plans to work with Trump on \"those better options.\" French President Emmanuel Macron is calling the U.S. decision to levy tariffs on the European Union \"illegal\" and a \"mistake.\" Macron said that he deplores the U.S. action and that he plans to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump later Thursday telling him just that. The French president said the tariff move does not in line with international trade law that the United States, France and Europe have subscribed to. He stressed that there would be a European response. Macron, who was the first foreign leader invited by Trump to a state visit, said the U.S. president's decision is a mistake because it creates economic and commercial nationalism. He ominously recalled the pre-World War II period saying, \"Economic nationalism leads to war. This is exactly what happened in the 1930s.\" The European Union says it plans to bring its case against new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum to the World Trade Organization on Friday. If that happens, the 28-nation EU would join China and India in triggering the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism over the American trade penalties. Turning to the WTO would give the EU a second response to the tariffs. It's already prepared $1.6 billion in retaliation against U.S. goods including steel, orange juice, motorcycles and bourbon whiskey. WTO proceedings could open the door to further penalties and increase pressure on Washington, though the process traditionally takes many months \u2014 and in some cases, years. The head of the World Trade Organization is expressing \"very real concern\" about rising trade tensions and the risk of escalation. The comments from Director-General Roberto Azevedo come in the wake of U.S. trade penalties on imported steel and aluminum. But he says the global trading system \"was built to resolve these problems in a way that prevents further escalation.\" Investors are responding to the White House's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports by selling U.S. companies that rely on the metals and bidding up domestic producers. Century Aluminum is up 3.6 percent and U.S. Steel 2.3 percent. Deere & Co., which makes farming equipment, is down 2.6 percent, and construction equipment maker Caterpillar is off 1.5 percent as investors anticipate that manufacturing costs could rise. Other losers among U.S. companies are consumer products makers, which could be hurt by tariffs that might be imposed by the European Union on products including peanut butter and orange juice. The conservative network backed by the wealthy brothers Charles and David Koch is coming out in opposition to President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from U.S. allies. Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity say the tariffs are tax increases on all Americans and are warning that the penalties will undermine the nation's economy and low unemployment rates. Ontario's premier is calling President Donald Trump a \"bully\" and says the new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum are \"ridiculous and unwarranted.\" Kathleen Wynne says Canada has to send a signal to Trump that Canada \"will not be your doormat.\" She says the only way to stand up to a bully is to stand up and push back. She's urging Canada take a swift and sharp retaliatory response. Wynne says Trump's actions will hurt jobs in the United States and Canada. The premier has a week left in her election campaign. The German government has rejected the tariffs on steel and aluminum announced by the Trump administration as \"unlawful.\" A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel refers in a statement to \"the danger of spirals of escalations\" that could hurt everyone. Germany's foreign minister is condemning the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, and he says the European Union \"is ready to react accordingly with counter measure.\" Heiko Maas has the support of German business associations that are rejecting the new trade penalties from the Trump administration. The German Association of the Automotive Industry VDA calls the U.S. decision \"incomprehensible.\" An a mechanical engineering industry group says Washington's action is \"a fatal signal for trans-Atlantic trade.\" The European Union stands ready to retaliate immediately following new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says \"it's totally unacceptable that a country is imposing unilateral measures when it comes to world trade.\" He says to expect \"counterbalancing measures\" from Europe soon. What does Germany's BGA association of foreign and wholesale traders think of the new U.S. tariffs on European Union steel and aluminum? \"A black hour for the trans-Atlantic relations.\" The group says in a statement that \"we deeply regret this unreasonable attitude by President Trump and its consequences.\" It's calling on the EU to respond in accordance with the law in order \"to not further weaken global trade.\" U.S. businesses in Europe are dismayed by President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union. They're worried it could spark a trade war. Susan Danger is CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU. She says U.S. companies in Europe are opposed to Washington's trade move. She says American businesses in Europe \"are very concerned by the damage a tit-for-tat dispute would cause to the trans-Atlantic economy and its impact on jobs, investment and security across the Atlantic.\" France says it's working with Germany and European authorities for a \"firm and united response\" to new U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum. An adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron tells The Associated Press that France is \"extremely mobilized\" for a response. But the adviser isn't elaborating. Macron argued against the tariffs when he met with Trump in Washington last month. Macron gave an impassioned speech on Wednesday against trade penalties and said they hurt jobs and consumers The European Union's top trade official says it is \"a bad day for world trade\" after the U.S. went ahead with tariffs on imports of EU steel and aluminum. Trade Commission Cecilia Malmstrom says the EU \"did everything to avoid this outcome.\" She says that during talks with Washington, \"the U.S. has sought to use the threat of trade restrictions as leverage to obtain concessions from the EU.\" And here's how Malmstrom puts it: \"This is not the way we do business, and certainly not between long-standing partners, friends and allies.\" She says the EU will now impose \"rebalancing measures\" on U.S. products. Britain says it's \"deeply disappointed\" by the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. The government says \"the U.K. and other European Union countries are close allies of the U.S. and should be permanently and fully exempted\" from the tariffs. In a statement, the British government says it has \"made clear to the U.S. government at the highest levels the importance of U.K. steel and aluminum to its businesses and defense projects.\" It says it will work with the EU and U.S. administration to achieve a permanent exemption. Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU but remains a member until the official exit day of March 29, 2019. Mexico says it will answer tariffs on steel and aluminum announced by the Trump administration with duties of its own on a variety of U.S. products. Mexico says it will impose tariffs on U.S. imports including pork bellies, apples, grapes, cheeses and flat steel among other things. A statement from Mexico's economy ministry says the U.S. use of a national security justification is improper and that the tariffs affect strategic sectors for North America, including automotive, aerospace and electronics. Trump announced the tariffs in March, but gave exemptions to the European Union, Mexico and Canada. That's the reaction from the European Commission's president to the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union. Jean-Claude Juncker says the EU will respond with countermeasures. He says the U.S. action leaves the EU with no choice but to proceed with a case in the World Trade Organization. He says the EU will impose additional duties on a number of imports from the U.S.",

            "article_content": "Stacey Abrams' campaign and legal team is preparing an unprecedented legal challenge in the unresolved Georgia governor's race that could leave the state's Supreme Court deciding whether to force another round of voting. The Democrat's longshot strategy relies on a statute that's never been used in such a high-stakes contest. It is being discussed as Georgia elections officials appear to be on the cusp of certifying Republican Brian Kemp as the winner of a bitterly fought campaign that's been marred by charges of electoral malfeasance. Top Abrams advisers outlined her prospective case to The Associated Press, stressing that the Democratic candidate hasn't finalized a decision about whether to proceed once state officials certify Kemp as the victor. That could happen as early as Friday evening. Allegra Lawrence-Hardy, Abrams' campaign chairwoman, is overseeing a team of almost three-dozen lawyers who in the coming days will draft the petition, along with a ream of affidavits from voters and would-be voters who say they were disenfranchised. Abrams would then decide whether to go to court under a provision of Georgia election law that allows losing candidates to challenge results based on \"misconduct, fraud or irregularities ... sufficient to change or place in doubt the results.\" The legal team is \"considering all options,\" Lawrence-Hardy said, including federal court remedies. But the state challenge is the most drastic. And some Democratic legal observers note Abrams would be dependent on statutes that set a high bar for the court to intervene. She already faces a narrow path to the governor's mansion. Unofficial returns show Kemp with about 50.2 percent of more than 3.9 million votes. That puts him about 18,000 votes above the threshold required to win by a majority and avoid a Dec. 4 runoff. The Associated Press is not calling the race until state officials certify the results. Abrams would assert that enough irregularities occurred to raise the possibility that at least 18,000 Georgians either had their ballots thrown out or were not allowed to vote. Lawrence-Hardy told the AP that Abrams will weigh legal considerations alongside her belief that many of her backers \u2014 particularly minority and poorer voters who don't regularly go to the polls \u2014 heeded her call to participate and ran into barriers. \"These stories to me are such that they have to be addressed,\" said Lawrence-Hardy, who was among the army of lawyers who worked on the Bush v. Gore presidential election dispute in 2000. \"It's just a much bigger responsibility. I feel like our mandate has blossomed. ... Maybe this is our moment.\" Kemp, who served as the state's chief elections officer until two days after the election when he resigned as secretary of state and declared victory, has maintained that any uncounted ballots won't change the outcome. His campaign has called Abrams' legal maneuvers so far a \"disgrace to democracy\" and an attempt to \"count illegal votes.\" The circumstances leave Abrams, a 44-year-old rising Democratic star, with a tough decision. The former state lawmaker became a national political celebrity with her bid to become the first black woman in American history to be elected governor. Her strategy of running as an unapologetic liberal who attracts new voters to the polls resonated in a rapidly changing state. Yet Abrams also must consider her own political future and the consequences of a protracted legal fight she might not win. All of that is playing out against the backdrop of Kemp's unabashed embrace of President Donald Trump's nationalism. Since Election Day, Abrams campaign workers have transitioned from get-out-the-vote efforts to helping voters determine whether their ballots were counted and documenting reported problems. The idea is to assemble a body of evidence to support the claim that the problems could account for Kemp's 18,000-vote margin above the runoff trigger. Affidavits from poll workers reviewed by the AP describe long lines that discouraged people from voting, poll workers failing to offer provisional ballots to people who didn't show up on the rolls or were at the wrong polling place and election equipment that froze and had to be rebooted. Cathy Cox, a Democrat who served as secretary of state from 1999 through 2007 and is now the dean of Mercer University's law school, said Georgia law puts a heavy burden on candidates such as Abrams who ask a court to intervene. \"I would say with pretty great confidence there has probably never been an election ... without some irregularity, where some poll worker did not make some mistake,\" Cox said in an interview. The key, she said, is proving someone erred to the point that it could change the outcome. Lawrence-Hardy agreed the law requires a quantitative analysis. She said Abrams' team doesn't have a list of 18,000 disenfranchised voters. The evidence, she said, would consist of hundreds, if not thousands of such examples, along with data analysis of projected lost votes based on other problems, such as a lack of paper ballots at precincts where voting machines broke down and voters left long lines. Cox said courts must attempt to apply a nonpartisan standard of \"doubt\" to the election. \"Would a reasonable person have a reason to doubt this election? Not would a hard-core partisan Democrat doubt a partisan Republican opponent,\" she said. Abrams and voting rights activists have argued for months that Kemp mismanaged the elections system as secretary of state, with Abrams often calling Kemp \"an architect of suppression.\" Under Georgia law, Abrams could file a challenge against Kemp or his successor as the secretary of state. The challenge must be filed within five days of certification in a trial court of the county where the chosen defendant resides. The defendant has between five and 10 days to respond, and the presiding judge sets a hearing within 20 days after that deadline, a calendar that could push a dispute well beyond what would have been a Dec. 4 runoff. If the judge determines the election is so defective that it casts doubt on the results, the judge can declare the election invalid and call a new vote among the same candidates. Cox called that \"the real extreme remedy.\" A more \"surgical\" course, she said, would be to affirm irregularities but only order that certified results be reopened and recertified once those problems are remedied. The judge could then declare a winner or order a runoff if the results are close enough. The judge could also declare a winner after hearing the evidence, but Cox said that's unlikely because the case will probably hinge on uncounted votes and there's no way to know before a count which candidate won those votes. Once the judge rules, the loser has 10 days to appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.",

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama is hitting the campaign trail in the final days before the midterm elections, stumping for Democratic candidates in critical races in states such as Illinois, Georgia and Florida. Obama has ramped up his campaign appearances in recent weeks, particularly urging members of the coalition that elected him twice -- women, minorities and young people especially -- to turn out to vote in 2018. The case Obama is making is somewhat similar to one that President Trump has made in his rallies, on the importance of voting in the midterm elections even though neither man is on the ballot. It's not unusual for former presidents to make campaign appearances after their tenure. But Obama is campaigning against Mr. Trump's agenda and Republican candidates less than two years after he left office, a departure from a historical norm in which former presidents tend to avoid openly criticizing their successors. Although former President George W. Bush has quietly campaigned for Republican candidates this year, and former President Bill Clinton campaigned for Democrats in 2012, most stay out of the spotlight in their first years of retirement. In 1994, two years after his father George H.W. Bush had lost the presidential election to Clinton, the younger Bush distanced himself from his father in his winning campaign for Texas governor. Although he stumped for the elder Bush during his re-election campaign in 1992, President Ronald Reagan was not a regular campaign presence in the 1990 midterms. President Harry Truman was a steady campaign presence after he departed office in 1953. After leaving office in 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt did hit the campaign trail in 1910, opposing his successor President Howard Taft's version of Republican leadership. That year, he gave his famous speech declaring the \"New Nationalism,\" his Republican program which advocated for labor rights. Examples of presidents campaigning shortly after they leave office are few and far between, but Obama believes that this election is critical enough for him to disregard precedent and stump for Democratic candidates. In his first campaign appearance in Chicago, Illinois, on Sept. 7, Obama said that he had not openly criticized Mr. Trump because he was \"intent on following a wise American tradition of ex-presidents gracefully exiting the political stage and making room for new voices and new ideas.\" However, he added, \"this is one of those pivotal moment when every one of us, as citizens of the United States, need to determine just who it is that we are, just what it is that we stand for.\" \"As a fellow citizen, not as an ex-president but as a fellow citizen, I am here to deliver a simple message, and that is that you need to vote because our democracy depends on it,\" he said.

            "article_content": "SEVASTOPOL, Crimea --\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0was busy campaigning for re-election in Crimea, the province he took illegally from Ukraine. With a warm-up act and a crowd acting as the base, Putin is pumping up potential Russia voters -- the name of the game this election season. There's no question President Putin is going to win Sunday's election, but precisely because there's no real contest, plenty of Russians are apathetic, so the Kremlin is working hard to make sure they're not embarrassed by a low turnout. Putin's message on Wednesday was filled with nationalism: Crimea has returned home, he said. To Russia. He's talking about when Russian troops in 2014\u00a0 -- wearing uniforms with no insignia, the so-called Little Green Men --\u00a0seized Crimea\u00a0 from Ukraine. At the time, Putin denied he'd sent in the military. Then when it was all over, he bragged about it. The U.S. and most countries called the seizure illegal and slapped on sanctions. \u00a0 But Wednesday, on his whirlwind tour, Putin visited the bridge Russia is building to link Crimea to the Russian mainland. It's a megaproject that's wildly popular with Russians who support the land grab. It's also a message to the West: Putin doesn't ever back down -- something else he knows Russian voters love about him. As he said before he left the stage, \"I would like to hug you all.\" Putin made no mention of the growing rift with Britain over the poisoing of the Russian exile Sergei Skripal, but the very fact that he held a rally in disputed territory makes a bold statement about Russia's attitude to international law.

            "article_content": "President Trump wasted no time taking a jab at his French counterpart Friday as he arrived in Paris for events marking the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I. Tweeting as he landed, Mr. Trump said President Emmanuel Macron had made an \"insulting\" proposal to build up Europe's military to counter the U.S., China and Russia. President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly! It was a clear sign that the \"America first\" president was ready to chart his own course yet again as world leaders gathered to remember the coalition that brought an end to the first global war. Mr. Trump's visit comes on the heels of midterm elections in which Americans delivered a split referendum on his presidency, keeping the Senate in his party's control but ceding the House to opposition Democrats. He planned to meet with Macron on Saturday for talks on topics expected to include European security, Syria and Iran. As he arrived, Mr. Trump tweeted that Macron \"has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\" Mr. Trump's brief visit to Europe comes amid uncertainty about the U.S. relationship with the continent. Mr. Trump has railed against trade deals with the European Union and has criticized some EU nations, including France, for not spending enough to defense to sustain NATO, the decades-old Western alliance formed as a bulwark to Moscow's aggression. At a NATO meeting in July, Mr. Trump similarly railed against the European leaders as he was meeting them, tweeting \"What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy?\" The president's tweet about Germany came after he had what he described as a \"great meeting\" with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said Friday in Paris that the U.S. was concerned about stability in Europe and that Mr. Trump was not shirking from global engagement. \"I think the enduring lesson (of World War I) for the United States is that when you become a global power ... you have global interests to protect,\" Bolton said. \"Great world leaders,\" he said, are \"driven by national interests.\" For Sunday's armistice anniversary, Mr. Trump was to join world leaders at a ceremony in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe. \"It should be a very beautiful period of time, the 100th anniversary of the ending of World War I. We have many countries \u2014 the leadership from many countries will be there, especially since they heard the United States will be there. And we look forward to that,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Friday before leaving the White House. \"I've seen what they have planned, and I think it's going to be something very, very special.\" Mr. Trump originally wanted to celebrate Veterans Day on Sunday with a grand military parade in Washington, as he was inspired by the tanks and flyovers he saw during France's Bastille Day celebration when he visited Paris in July of last year. Mr. Trump ordered the Pentagon to come up with plans for his own version, but they were eventually scrapped over concerns about costs and the damage tanks weighing many tons would do to the streets in Washington. Mr. Trump and Macron's early relationship was marked by kisses, frequent meetings and marathon power handshakes. Early on, Macron tried to position himself as a sort of \"Trump whisperer\" and Mr. Trump returned the favor, hosting Macron at the first and only state dinner of his presidency. But the relationship-building failed to persuade Mr. Trump to remain in the global climate change or Iran deals and did nothing to protect France from U.S. tariffs. The dividends of Macron's cultivation of Mr. Trump are \"modest at best,\" said Stewart M. Patrick, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. At the same time, Macron has increasingly been positioning himself as a bulwark against the rising tide of Trump-style populism across Europe, speaking out loudly against the dangers of nationalism and isolationist retreat. \"He's starting to become the antithesis of President Trump's public messaging,\" said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at Center for Strategic and International Studies. The president and first lady Melania Trump were expected to visit several memorial sites in France that are dedicated to American service members. Not on Mr. Trump's schedule, despite earlier discussions about the possibility, was an extended meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"I don't know that we're seeing each other in Paris, but we may,\" Trump said. \"There may be a lunch for the leaders.\" The White House and the Kremlin had previously considered a formal meeting in Paris. That now seems more likely for later this month, when they attend the Group of 20 summit of international leaders in Argentina. Mr. Trump and Putin have met previously on the sidelines of two summits and had their own bilateral meeting in July in Helsinki. At that meeting, Mr. Trump would not say whether he believed Putin or U.S. intelligence agencies about their conclusions about Russia's interference with the 2016 presidential election.",

            "article_content": "In a wide-ranging interview with \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Norah O'Donnell, Joe Biden explained what factors will go into his decision on whether to run in 2020. The former vice president is currently the Democrats' top choice to run against President Trump though Biden said he thinks it's too early for that to mean very much.   \"I don't think about the polling data. I think about whether or not I should run based on very private decisions relating to my family and the loss of my son and what I want to do with the rest of my life,\" Biden said. \"But I don't think of it in terms of can I win, can I \u2013 will I lose. That's not part of the calculation.\" The 75-year-old also said his age would be a \"legitimate issue\" if he were to run in 2020. President Trump, a fellow septuagenarian, is three years younger than him.\u00a0 \"I think people are going to judge it, if I were to run. I think they're gonna judge me on my vitality. Can I still run up the steps of Air Force Two? Am I still in good shape? Am I \u2013 do I have all my faculties? Am I energetic? I think it's totally legitimate people ask those questions,\" Biden said.  Biden, who received the 2018 Freedom Award Wednesday night for his contribution to civil rights, has been on the road campaigning for Democrats ahead of the midterm elections. He's worried that American values are \"under assault.\" \"I think our basic American values are at stake. Decency, honor, giving hate no safe harbor, telling the truth, understanding there's something bigger than you,\" Biden said. \"It really is under assault. It is one of those things that I think that only a minority of the American people share his view about that is so dismissive of the basic American mores\u2026I mean, look what the world is seeing lately. They see Charlottesville and what he says. They see him embracing these dictators around the world attacking our allies. They see in a situation where he talks about he has a policy of literally ripping children from their parents at the border, for God's sake. I mean, it's not who we are.\" \u00a0Walking past the Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, he tells O'Donnell a lot has changed since then. Still, he remains optimistic about America's future.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"I was asked by a reporter, 'Well, if he (President Trump) changed, would you be supportive?' Absolutely. Absolutely. But stop this phony populism which is about, 'I have a problem, it's because of that immigrant or that black guy.' Or stop this, this naked nationalism which, instead of making us number one, is making us last,\" he said.\u00a0 Earlier this month, Attorney General Eric Holder, who is considering a 2020 run himself, disagreed with Michelle Obama's mantra, 'When they go low, we go high.'\" Instead, Holder said, \"When they go low, we kick them.\"\u00a0 \"Well, you know that's -- I respect the attorney general, but it's not my view. I don't want to get down in the mosh pit with these guys. It's not a place I want to play. He just drags you and it's part of his strategy. Part of their strategy. Drag you down and talk about, attack each other personally,\" Biden said. \"I think the American people are desperately looking for leaders to bring them together, not split them. We cannot function in this country without arriving at a consensus.\" In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" in July, President Trump called Biden his \"dream opponent\" for 2020, adding, \"Look, Joe Biden ran three times. He never got more than 1 percent and President Obama took him out of the garbage heap, and everybody was shocked that he did.\" \"Well, I tell you what \u2013 well, I shouldn't say anything,\" Biden said. \"Age has given me some wisdom.\"",

            "article_content": "BEIJING - The brewing China-U.S. trade conflict features two leaders who've expressed friendship but are equally determined to pursue their nation's interests and their own political agendas. But while President Donald Trump faces continuing churn in his administration and a tough challenge in midterm congressional elections, China's Xi Jinping leads an outwardly stable authoritarian regime. Xi recently succeeded in pushing through a constitutional reform allowing him to rule for as long as he wishes while facing no serious electoral challenge. Here's a look at some of the issues that could determine the outcome of the trade spat: Although Mr. Trump sounded tough on the campaign trail and has challenged Beijing over trade and Taiwan, he professes admiration for his Chinese counterpart and complimented him on his ability to remove term limits on his presidential rule. \"President Xi and I will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade,\" Mr. Trump said in a tweet Sunday. \"China's great and Xi is a great gentleman,\" he said in remarks at a Republican fundraiser last month obtained by CNN. Xi has generally limited his comments to emphasizing the benefits of a close China-U.S. relationship and thanking Mr. Trump in a phone call on March 10 for congratulating him on his obtaining a second term as president. China also hailed as successes a pair of summits between the leaders in the U.S. and China over the past year. Both Mr. Trump and Xi come from privileged backgrounds, although their routes to political power were decidedly different. However, both have built their reputations on a robust form of nationalism, with Mr. Trump promoting \"America First\" and Xi identifying himself with the \"Chinese Dream\" of rising prosperity accompanied by muscular defense and foreign policies. President Trump was born the son of a New York City real estate mogul and rose to his current post on a populist wave after a career as a property developer and reality TV star. Xi's father was a colleague of Mao Zedong, whose influence is believed to have aided his rise through a series of military, government and Communist Party positions before he was named party leader in 2012. Both also show an affection for strong-man leadership, and while American democracy is far removed from China's one-party authoritarian system, Mr. Trump's verbal attacks on the mainstream media and certain judges have drawn criticism. They both also place a strong emphasis on the military, including increased defense budgets and an appreciation for military parades, two of which Xi has led during his time in office. Xi's plan to create Chinese global competitors in fields including robotics, electric cars and pharmaceuticals is seen as precipitating the current crisis, while Mr. Trump appears motivated by a desire to shore up America's manufacturing strength. Neither wants to be seen as backing down, and though Xi's usually soft-spoken manner contrasts Mr. Trump's trademark bravado, both \"are thin-skinned bullies who place a lot of value on portraying strength,\" said Liz Economy, a leading academic on China and author of \"The Third Revolution: Xi Jinping and the New Chinese State.\" \"This makes it difficult to ramp down in this one-on-one tariff death match,\" although both have the capacity via Twitter or state media to trumpet their success and ignore any failings once the dispute has concluded, Economy said. While the current dispute has focused on trade, many other factors are in play, bringing out the bargaining qualities and transactional natures of the two leaders and their administrations. Opinions on who has the upper hand differ widely. By pursuing the tariff threat and backing complaints about intellectual property theft, President Trump has \"successfully changed the fundamentals of ... U.S.-China relations,\" said Miles Yu Maochun, a China politics expert at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Yu also points to recent U.S. policy on North Korea, particularly Mr. Trump's acceptance of an invitation to talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as early as next month that appeared to catch Beijing off guard. Shortly afterward, Kim paid an unexpected debut visit to China as leader in what some saw as an attempt by Beijing to reassert its centrality in resolving tensions over the North's nuclear weapons and missile programs. Yet, as North Korea's most important trade partner and political ally, China wields considerable influence, and its willingness to enforce U.N. sanctions has built up its credibility as a reliable international partner. China also stands to bring additional pressure on Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy it claims, and which is closely linked to Washington despite technically unofficial ties. While Beijing responded mildly to Mr. Trump's early outreach to the island's independence-leaning government, recent moves such as the appointment of hawkish new National Security Adviser John Bolton, the passage of a U.S. law encouraging more intergovernmental exchanges and an agreement to pass submarine manufacturing technology to Taiwan are hardening views among anti-American nationalists in China. Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office on Wednesday warned against additional moves to strengthen relations with Taiwan, amid reports that Bolton could visit the island this year. \"Any attempt to play the 'Taiwan card' would only be futile,\" spokesman Ma Xiaoguang said at a biweekly news conference. China, Ma said, would \"not hesitate to protect our core interests.\" While Yu cited domestic support for Mr. Trump's trade approach to China, Xi can likely command even stronger backing at home for a muscular approach toward what Beijing portrays as a conflict resulting from U.S. unilateralism and hegemony. Xi also faces no electoral challenge such as the one the president's Republican party will confront in midterm congressional elections later this year, when Mr. Trump's handling of the U.S. economy and a host of other issues will be in the mix. Mindful of American voters, especially in the agricultural and industrial sectors, Xi appears set to use such leverage for maximum gain. \"Xi will follow a tough but well directed path designed to hurt specific interests that will complain loudly,\" said Joseph Fewsmith, a Boston University expert on Chinese foreign policy. While Xi is broadly considered the most powerful leader since Mao, China \"only appears to be united and confident in its approach,\" said Economy, the academic, adding that the outside world has limited insight into policy debates within China.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump escalated his verbal assaults against France and its leader on Tuesday, suggesting that America's stalwart European ally would have been vanquished in both world wars if not for the military firepower provided by the United States. Mr. Trump tweeted about a suggestion by French President Emmanuel Macron that Europe build up its militaries because the continent can no longer depend on the U.S. for defense. Macron had also said Europe needs to protect itself against cyberthreats from China, Russia and the U.S. \"Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\" The president has long complained that NATO countries don't pay their fair share of the defense alliance's expenses, leaving the U.S. to carry much of the burden. He has criticized Macron before and after attending a weekend ceremony in Paris to commemorate 100 years since the end of World War I. Mr. Trump was\u00a0criticized himself for not attending a second commemoration for the soldiers killed in that war on Sunday at a cemetery in France. He said he couldn't due to inclement weather, and on Tuesday he insisted it was his own Secret Service detail that said it wouldn't be safe to travel.  By the way, when the helicopter couldn\u2019t fly to the first cemetery in France because of almost zero visibility, I suggested driving. Secret Service said NO, too far from airport & big Paris shutdown. Speech next day at American Cemetary in pouring rain! Little reported-Fake News! Mr. Trump and Macron met Saturday at the Elysee Palace and discussed defense, trade and other issues. A top adviser to Macron said Tuesday that the French position has been \"clarified.\" The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with French customs, said Macron explained the European army issue to Mr. Trump, stressing that France was not making a choice between a European defense mechanism and multilateral organizations such as NATO. Many French officials have complained that Macron's initial remarks last week on the notion of a pan-European army were taken out of context, and that he wasn't actually lumping together the United States with China and Russia as potential foes in any hypothetical conflict.  In his comment to French radio, Macron first noted Mr. Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Cold War-era treaty with Russia known as START, which limits both countries' development of nuclear weapons. It was in that context, and after Mr. Trump's repeated criticisms of NATO, that Macron said Europe must be better prepared to defend itself. \"We have to protect ourselves, with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,\" Macron told France's Europe 1 radio in the interview. France's Ambassador to the U.S. said in a tweet on Tuesday that there was a difference between Macron's call for European joint defense, \"with respect\" to the U.S., and suggestions by some media outlets -- and now Mr. Trump -- that he was arguing for defense \"against\" or from the U.S. For the sake of truth, Pres.@EmmanuelMacron didn\u2019t say that EU needed an army \u201cagainst the US\u201d. It was an erroneous press report. On Tuesday, German leader Angela Merkel backed Macron's call for a pan-European military force, telling European Parliamentarians \"We should work on a vision of one day establishing a real European army.\" She said such a European force would help to address criticism from the U.S. that Europe wasn't pulling its own weight in the realm of defense, and would bolster the EU role in NATO rather than detract from it. Macron warned on Sunday that the \"ancient demons\" that caused World War I and the millions of deaths associated with it were once again making headway. Macron, who has been urging a re-embrace of multinational organizations and cooperation that have been shunned by Mr. Trump, delivered a barely veiled rebuke of the U.S. leader's policies at the weekend's centerpiece event: A gathering of dozens of leaders at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the base of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the passage of a century since the guns fell silent in the global war. \u00a0 With Mr. Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron took on the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe and urged leaders not to turn their backs by turning inward. \"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\" Macron said, six days after President Trump declared himself a \"nationalist.\"  The French leader said that when nations put their interests first and decide \"who cares about the others,\" they \"erase the most precious thing a nation can have ... its moral values.\" After Mr. Trump was gone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently announced that she will not be seeking re-election, made an impassioned plea for global cooperation at the peace forum, saying World War I had \"made clear what disastrous consequences a lack of compromise in politics and diplomacy can have.\" Trump, who has made clear that he has limited patience for broad, multilateral agreements, sat mostly stone-faced as he listened to Macron, who sees himself as Europe's foil to the rising nationalist sentiment, which has taken hold in Hungary and Poland among other countries. The president added that \"The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%. He was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!.......MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!\" he said. The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%. He was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!........ Macron is hovering at around 30 percent in popularity polls, while the unemployment rate is just above 9 percent. Mr. Trump's own approval rating in the U.S., according to the most recent polling data, remains just under 40 percent. The most recent CBS News Poll, in May this year, showed him reaching the 40 percent mark. Mr. Trump's continued complaints about France and Macron struck a nerve with some in the European nation, especially since the president's latest broadsides came on the third anniversary of the Paris terror attacks that killed 130 people in 2015. It prompted French journalist Hugo Clement to tweet in response: \"We are already great, especially on november 13th. Go back to your room and give the phone to an adult.\" Mr. Trump also complained Tuesday about tariffs on U.S. wines sold in France and appeared to take a dig at Macron's low public approval rating. The president tweeted that French tariffs on American wine were, \"not fair, must change!\" \"On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!\" Nearly all U.S. wine exports to major markets, including the European Union -- of which France is a part -- face tariffs, according to the Wine Institute, which represents California winemakers in Washington on matters of tax, trade and regulatory issues. Mr. Trump, who built a career as a businessman before he entered politics, opened a winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2011.",

Bremmer also emphasized the significance of millions of Americans who feel disconnected from the political process. \"The idea that we're going to blame people that voted for Trump as opposed to a much larger group of people that didn't bother to vote at all \u2013 45 percent \u2013 as opposed to the much smaller group of Trump supporters, or that Hillary got? Or we're going to not blame the people that sat by and voted for establishment figures like the Clintons, like the Bushes for decades, while people in the country got so angry and so displaced they felt like the only thing they could do was vote for someone like Trump?\" Does he see a solution?  \"In the near term, let's recognize that getting rid of Trump is not going to solve this, in the sense that it's not just happening in the U.S.,\" Bremmer said. He noted that similar trends can be seen all across Europe. \"We saw the elections in Italy, we saw the elections in Germany, we saw the Brexit vote, we saw the elections in Hungary. This is not just an American problem.  \"The only place you don't see it is in Japan, where they don't take any immigrants and where the population is shrinking.\"  Co-host John Dickerson also asked Bremmer about the latest messages coming from North Korea about its nuclear weapons program and an upcoming summit with Presdient Trump.  \"They are giving us a continued cease of testing both of ICBMs and nukes, we are giving them a summit; that is not new news,\" Bremmer said. \"Both have been announced a month ago. It's been reiterated. They're talking about denuclearization. It's not actually going to happen.  \"But I think Trump is one of those guys that, if he gets 5 percent of what he wants, his ability to spin that into, 'This is the best that humanity has ever seen and I deserve a Nobel,' is fairly high. So, it is getting progress, and I think at least in the near-term this is becoming a bigger opportunity.\" Dickerson asked, \"There is this red line of 'Do they have a nuclear program or not?' The administration has said they don't want them to have any nuclear program. So, can he still do the 5 percent end-zone dance if the nuclear program is still in existence in any form?\"  \"I think that Trump said a lot of things that he has changed his mind on once it becomes politically expedient, and this will be one of those things,\" Bremmer replied. \"Remember, the Israel-Palestinian peace plan was one that he and Jared [Kushner] were going to do. I have not heard them discuss that in months now, because they've tilted towards North Korea. This is now the priority, and Kim Jong Un is playing a little ball with them, right? \u00a0So, I think the summit is going to happen.\" He also noted the significance of CIA Director and Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo's recent trip to meet with the North Koreans. \"Pompeo was over there. He didn't make any demands of the North Koreans, which is another thing -- you see, they don't want to make it uncomfortable, make it easy for Kim Jong Un to come to this meeting, and announce they've done something that no other president has ever done: sat down with Kim Jong Un. \u00a0That's a big deal. Trump deserves a win for it. Let's hope he doesn't break it.\"  \"Us vs. Them: The Failure of Globalism\" by Ian Bremmer (Penguin) is available at bookstores Tuesday.

            "article_content": "The U.S. this week will begin withdrawing many of the active duty troops sent to the border with Mexico by President Trump just before the midterm election in response to a caravan of Central American migrants, U.S. officials said Monday. About 2,200 of the active duty troops will be pulled out before the holidays, the officials said, shrinking an unusual domestic deployment that was viewed by critics as a political stunt and a waste of military resources.\u00a0 That will leave about 3,000 active duty troops in Texas, Arizona and California, mainly comprised of military police and helicopter transport crews who are assisting border patrol agents. There also will still be about 2,300 members of the National Guard who were sent to the border region as part of a separate deployment that started in April. The active duty troops, numbering about 5,200 as of Monday, were initially scheduled to stay until Dec. 15. Late last month, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis extended the mission to the end of January at the request of the Department of Homeland Security. It's unclear if it will be extended again. The U.S. forces have installed vast amounts of razor wire and provided transportation and protection for the Border Patrol. The troops are not there to directly deal with the Central American migrants, many of whom eventually made their way to Tijuana, just south of California. One of the officials said that some of the military police and helicopter crews will stay in the border region so they can quickly respond if they are needed by border agents. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal plans not yet made public. Active duty troops began arriving at the border in early November for an initial 45-day deployment, in response to the caravan, which at one point numbered about 7,000 people, including many families with children. On Monday, Col. Rob Manning said there are currently 2,200 active duty troops in Texas; 1,350 in Arizona; and 1,650 in California. \"Some units have completed their mission and they have already started to partially redeploy. Other units have been identified to rotate home and will be returning home over the next several weeks,\" Manning said. He declined to say how low the number of troops will go in coming weeks or provide details on any changes. He added, \"the numbers of troops that we have will be commensurate with the support\" that Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection request. Headquarters forces for U.S. Army North will remain in Texas, and the troops in California and Arizona include engineers, military police, logisticians, aviation personnel and medical personnel. The bulk of the active duty troops in California are Marines based at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego, so many can easily move back and forth from the border to their home base. A report to Congress last month estimated the cost of the military deployment to the border at $210 million, including $72 million for the active-duty troops and $138 million so far for the National Guard forces. The Guard troops have been performing their separate border mission since April. There have been no updated estimates released. ___ AP National Security writer Robert Burns contributed to this report.",

It said the closures were needed \"to install and pre-position port hardening infrastructure equipment in preparation for the migrant caravan and the potential safety and security risk that it could cause.\"\u00a0 On Thursday, 1,100 Marines from Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in California were deployed to support border security, CBS San Diego affiliate KFMB reported. They were primarily tasked with installing concertina wire and pre-positioning jersey barriers, barricades and fencing. \"CBP has been and will continue to prepare for the potential arrival of thousands of people migrating in a caravan heading towards the border of the United States,\" Pete Flores, director of San Diego field operations for CBP, said in a statement. The caravans became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and President Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to help fend off the migrants. Mr. Trump has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\u00a0 To the thousands of Central American migrants making their way toward Mexico's Pacific coast state of Nayarit, the prospect of meeting a hostile reception at the border is nothing new. After a month on the road, through three countries, migrants like Maribel, 22, from La Ceiba, Honduras, are used to tough conditions.\u00a0 Maribel, who did not want her last name used for fear of reprisals in Honduras, pushed a baby carriage with her 1-year-old daughter while her husband pushed another with their 3-year-old son along a highway leading from Guadalajara to the Nayarit capital of Tepic.\u00a0 \"We are well aware of everything Trump has been saying,\" said Maribel. \"Let them close whatever they want to close, but we are going to get through anyway.\"\u00a0 The thousands of Central American migrants left shelters in Guadalajara early Tuesday and were taken by bus to a highway tollbooth to wait for rides to their next destination. Most appeared intent on taking the Pacific coast route northward to the border city of Tijuana, which was still about 1,350 miles away. The migrants have come about 1,500 miles since they started out in Honduras around October 13. While the caravan previously averaged only about 30 miles a day, the migrants are now covering daily distances of 185 miles or more, partly because they are relying on hitchhiking rather than walking.\u00a0 A smaller, second caravan began arriving in Mexico City on Monday. A third caravan was heading toward the capital.\u00a0 Many say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.

            "article_content": "GOYANG, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un walked across the border Friday and met South Korean President Moon Jae-in. It's the first time a member of the Kim dynasty has set foot on southern soil since the end of the Korean War in 1953 and the latest bid to settle the world's last Cold War standoff. Kim's news agency said earlier Friday that the leader would \"open-heartedly\" discuss with Moon \"all the issues arising in improving inter-Korean relations.\" Moon's senior spokesman said Kim joked to he would make sure not to interrupt Moon's sleep anymore, apparently referring to the North's series of early morning missile tests last year.  Moon's spokesman says Kim also made a reference to a South Korean island that became a target of a North Korean artillery attack that killed four in 2010. Kim says the residents of Yeonpyeong Island who have been living under the fear of North Korean artillery attacks and also families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War have high hopes for the inter-Korean talks to help heal past scars.\u00a0 Kim also said he would visit Seoul's presidential Blue House if invited. \u00a0 As of noon local time, Kim and Moon had finished the finished the morning session of their summit at a border truce village.\u00a0 Television showed bodyguards jogging beside Kim's black limousine as it rolled back to the northern side of the Pamunjom where Kim and other North Korean officials participating in the summit are expected to have lunch.\u00a0 Moon's spokesman Yoon Young-chan says Kim mentioned the defectors among people who have high expectations for the summit to heal scars and improve relations between the rivals.\u00a0 Yoon quoted Kim as saying: \"We should value this opportunity so that the scars between the South and North could be healed.\"\u00a0 Yoon says Kim added: \"The border line isn't that high; it will eventually be erased if a lot of people pass over it.\"\u00a0 North Korea normally expresses anger toward defectors and often accuses South Korea of abducting or enticing its citizens to defect.\u00a0 The North in 2016 accused the South of abducting 12 North Korean women who had worked at restaurant in China and demanded them to be sent back to the North. That was months before the North called a senior North Korean diplomat who defected to the South as \"human scum.\"\u00a0 Around 30,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.\u00a0 Seoul also said Kim described the country's transport conditions as poor as he and Moon discussed Moon's potential visit to the North.\u00a0 Moon' spokesman Yoon Young-chan says Kim's comments came after Moon expressed a desire to travel across North Korea to visit Mount Paektu that touches the country's border with China.\u00a0 According to Yoon, Kim in response said such a trip might be currently uncomfortable for Moon because the country's transport system was deficient. Yoon says Kim also said North Korean delegates who visited the South during February's Winter Olympics also came back impressed with South Korea's bullet train service.\u00a0 Yoon says Moon in response said North Koreans would also be able to enjoy the South's high-speed trains if the rivals improve relations and reconnect their rail networks across the border.\u00a0 The leaders plan to meet again in the afternoon at the southern side of the village for talks Seoul says are aimed at resolving the standoff over the North's nuclear weapons.\u00a0 CBS News' Ben Tracy reports the two will talk deeply about denuclearization. The White House issued a statement after the meeting saying \"we are hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace.\" \"We wish the Korean people well. We are hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula,\" the statement read. \"The United States appreciates the close coordination with our ally, the Republic of Korea, and looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks.\" Isaac Stone Fish, CBSN contributor and senior fellow at the Asia Society, explained the significance of this event. \"It's certainly incredibly significant to see these two men meeting with expectations of peace being so high,\" Fish said. \"I think a lot of people have talked about the shift of where we are today and where we were several months ago. It's important to remember that even though the two leaders are smiling and posing with children ... it's very possible in a few months from now, tensions will go back to where they were.\" \"It's hard to know how much credit to give to Trump's sanctions and his 'maximum pressure' policy and how much credit to give to Kim Jong Un -- the North Korean dictator feeling secure at home, feeling that he's consolidated enough power domestically, feeling that he now has enough of a nuclear weapons arsenal that he can negotiate -- if not from a position of strength -- a position that he's comfortable he'll be able to stay in power,\" Fish added. With a single step over a weathered, cracked slab of concrete, Kim made the historic trip Friday by crossing over the world's most heavily armed border to greet his rival Moon for talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons. Kim then invited Moon to cross briefly north with him before they returned to the southern side. Those small steps must be seen in the context of the last year -- when the United States, its ally South Korea and the North seemed at times to be on the verge of nuclear war as the North unleashed a torrent of weapons tests -- but also in light of the long, destructive history of the rival Koreas, who fought one of the 20th century's bloodiest conflicts and even today occupy a divided peninsula that's still technically in a state of war. It was all smiles Friday as Moon grasped Kim's hand and led him along an blindingly red carpet into South Korean territory, where school children placed flowers around their necks and an honor guard stood at attention for inspection. Beyond the surface, however, it's still not clear whether the leaders can make any progress in closed-door talks on the nuclear issue, which has bedeviled U.S. and South Korean officials for decades. North Korea's nuclear and missile tests last year likely put it on the threshold of becoming a legitimate nuclear power. North Korea claims it has already risen to that level. Kim's news agency said that the leader would \"open-heartedly\" discuss with Moon \"all the issues arising in improving inter-Korean relations and achieving peace, prosperity and reunification of the Korean peninsula\" in a \"historic\" summit. It's the first time one of the ruling Kim leaders has crossed over to the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone since the Korean War ended in 1953. The greeting of the two leaders was planned to the last detail. Thousands of journalists were kept in a huge conference center well away from the summit, except for a small group of tightly-controlled pool reporters at the border. Moon stood near the Koreas' dividing line, moving forward the moment he glimpsed Kim appearing in front of a building on the northern side. They shook hands with the border line between them. Moon then invited Kim to cross into the South; Kim invited Moon into the North, and they then took a ceremonial photo facing the North and then another photo facing the South. Two fifth-grade students from the Daesongdong Elementary School, the only South Korean school within the DMZ, greeted the leaders and gave them flowers. Kim and Moon then saluted an honor guard and military band, and Moon introduced Kim to South Korean government officials. Kim returned the favor with the North Korean officials accompanying him. They were to take a photo inside the Peace House, where the summit was to take place, in front of a painting of South Korea's Bukhan Mountain, which towers over the South Korean Blue House presidential mansion. Nuclear weapons will top the agenda, and Friday's summit will be the clearest sign yet of whether it's possible to peacefully negotiate those weapons away from a country that has spent decades doggedly building its bombs despite crippling sanctions and near-constant international opprobrium. Expectations are generally low, given that past so-called breakthroughs on North Korea's weapons have collapsed amid acrimonious charges of cheating and bad faith. Skeptics of engagement have long said that the North often turns to interminable rounds of diplomacy meant to ease the pain of sanctions -- giving it time to perfect its weapons and win aid for unfulfilled nuclear promises. Advocates of engagement say the only way to get a deal is to do what the Koreas will try Friday: Sit down and see what's possible. Moon, a liberal whose election last year ended a decade of conservative rule in Seoul, will be looking to make some headway on the North's nuclear program in advance of a planned summit in several weeks between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump. Kim, the third member of his family to rule his nation with absolute power, is eager, both in this meeting and in the Trump talks, to talk about the nearly 30,000 heavily armed U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and the lack of a formal peace treaty ending the Korea War - two factors, the North says, that make nuclear weapons necessary. North Korea may also be looking to use whatever happens in the talks with Moon to set up the Trump summit, which it may see as a way to legitimize its declared status as a nuclear power. One possible outcome Friday, aside from a rise in general goodwill between the countries, could be a proposal for a North Korean freeze of its weapons ahead of later denuclearization. Seoul and Washington will be pushing for any freeze to be accompanied by rigorous and unfettered outside inspections of the North's nuclear facilities, since past deals have crumbled because of North Korea's unwillingness to open up to snooping foreigners. South Korea, in announcing Thursday some details of the leaders' meeting, acknowledged that the most difficult sticking point between the Koreas has been North Korea's level of denuclearization commitment. Kim has reportedly said that he wouldn't need nuclear weapons if his government's security could be guaranteed and external threats were removed. Whatever the Koreas announce Friday, the spectacle of Kim being feted on South Korean soil will be something to behold. Kim and Moon will be enjoying each other's company in the jointly controlled village of Panmunjom near the spot where a defecting North Korean soldier recently fled south in a hail of bullets fired by his former comrades.",

            "article_content": "SAVANNAH, Ga. \u2014 Republican Brad Raffensperger won a runoff election to become Georgia's next secretary of state, taking over the office at the center of a debate over voter access and election security in the Southern state. Raffensperger, a state lawmaker from suburban Atlanta, defeated former Democratic congressman John Barrow to become Georgia's top elections official, the office vacated by Gov.-elect Brian Kemp. At his victory party, Raffensperger told supporters he would faithfully carry out elections in Georgia. \"I'm going to make sure that elections are clean, fair and accurate,\" he said. \"And that's the No. 1 priority as your next secretary of state.\" A statement from Barrow said, \"we need to make sure that every voice is heard\" and that he'll wait for the remaining ballots to come in and be counted. The runoff campaign played out against the backdrop of Democratic accusations that Kemp used his position as secretary of state to suppress minority turnout and increase his own odds of victory. Kemp insists that's false, pointing to large increases in voter registration on his watch and record turnout in the Nov. 6 midterms. Raffensperger finished the three-way general election race ahead of Barrow, but just shy of the 50 percent of the vote needed to avoid a runoff. Issues that dogged Kemp in the general election \u2014 Georgia's strict \"exact match\" policy for confirming voters' identities and reports that the state's aging electronic voting system was vulnerable to hackers \u2014 became the focus of the race to succeed him. Both Raffensperger and Barrow promised to replace Georgia's voting machines with a system that produces paper records that could be used to audit elections if needed. Meanwhile, Raffensperger pledged to continue Kemp's practices of strictly enforcing voter ID laws and pruning registration rolls of inactive voters to prevent voting fraud. Barrow said Georgia needed to make it less difficult to cast ballots. Casting their ballots for Raffensperger in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood, Julia Chabannes and her husband Jimmy Cook, both 69, said they were skeptical about Democratic assertions that voters were disenfranchised by Kemp's policies. \"If there was a million people disenfranchised, they've been disenfranchised a long time because they've been in a graveyard,\" said Cook. President Trump endorsed Raffensperger with a tweet calling the Republican \"tough on Crime and Borders.\" The secretary of state oversees elections, professional licensing and business incorporation in Georgia. The office has no law enforcement role. Kemp's Democratic rival for governor, Stacey Abrams, urged voters to support Barrow during the same speech in which she acknowledged defeat and announced she would sue to challenge the way Georgia runs elections. That suit was filed in federal court last week. Barrow also won an endorsement from Smythe DuVal, the Libertarian candidate whose distant third-place finish in November forced the race into overtime. Raffensperger served four years in the Georgia House before running for statewide office. He will take over as secretary of state in January from Robyn Crittenden, who was appointed to the office when Kemp stepped aside last month. Barrow sought a political comeback after losing his U.S. House seat in 2014. He served a decade in Congress representing a large swath of eastern Georgia that included Athens, Augusta and Savannah.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014\u00a0As the government remains partially closed through the holidays, President Trump said the impasse in budget negotiations will continue until his $5 billion demand for border wall funding is met. He spoke to reporters in the Oval Office on Christmas morning. \"I can't tell you when the government is going to reopen,\" Mr. Trump said after hosting a video conference call with U.S. troops stationed overseas to thank them for their service. \"I can tell you it's not going to reopen until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want, but it's all the same thing.\"\u00a0 Asked about the hundreds of thousands of federal employees working without pay or furloughed during the shutdown, the president said workers want the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\u00a0 \"I think they understand what's happening. They want border security. The people of this country want border security,\" he said, adding, \"The only ones who don't are Democrats.\"\u00a0 A CBS News poll conducted in mid-November found\u00a059 percent of Americans oppose building a border wall. Mr. Trump again accused Democrats of not supporting funds for a border wall only because he made the issue an integral theme of his campaign and White House agenda. \"As soon as I said they want to build the wall, they were all against it,\" he said.\u00a0 The president also lamented canceling his holiday trip to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as the government remains partially closed. He told reporters he continues to have confidence in Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, despite a recent downturn in the stock market, calling Mnuchin a \"very talented guy.\" Mnuchin convened a\u00a0call with leaders of the nation's largest banks on Monday to shore up confidence in the U.S. economy, but the gesture instead seemed to deepen the anxiety of many investors. The president doubled down on his\u00a0criticism of the Federal Reserve and said the institution is \"raising interest rates too fast.\" Mr. Trump has publicly expressed regrets about appointing Jerome Powell as Fed chairman, but Mnuchin said on Saturday night that the president will not fire Powell\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a move scholars believe may not pass legal muster.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Concluding the Christmas Day question-and-answer session, Mr. Trump told reporters he expects to be the target of \"presidential harassment\" once Democrats take control of the House of Representatives in January. But he again denied any coordination between his presidential campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 election.\u00a0 \"There's been no collusion, after two years, no collusion,\" he said.\u00a0 Sara Cook contributed to this report.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Congress is set to pass a crucial spending bill that averts a government shutdown, but there's one potential obstacle: President Donald Trump. Neither party wants the government to close ahead of the midterm elections that will determine control of Congress, but Trump has made clear his frustration at the lack of money for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\u00a0He says it is \"ridiculous\" the wall has yet to be fully funded. With less than a week before a Sept. 30 deadline for a partial shutdown, Republican leaders hope they can get Trump to set aside his frustration about the wall and sign legislation that funds the military and a host of civilian agencies for the next year. The bill also would provide a short-term fix to keep the government running through Dec. 7. The Senate easily approved the measure last week, with only seven senators voting no. The vote in the House is expected to be closer, with House conservatives voicing displeasure that money is included for Planned Parenthood but not the wall. \"You want to stanch a blue wave\" of Democrats in the midterms? asked Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. \"Then keep your promises \u2014 and one of those promises is to build the wall.\" Trump himself raised the possibility last week that he may not sign the measure unless wall funding is included. \"Where is the money for border security and the wall in this ridiculous spending bill?\" Trump said Thursday on Twitter. Republicans \"must finally get tough\" against Democrats he said are obstructing law enforcement and border security, he added. But it seems only Trump can stop the spending legislation from becoming law. Biggs and other conservatives admit they don't have the numbers to defeat the spending bill in the House, given that leaders from both parties support the legislation. \"I expect it to pass. The votes are going to be there,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee who is among the best vote counters in the Capitol. \"There's substantial support\" for the bill in both parties, Cole said. He emphasized that the measure increases defense spending \u2014 including the largest pay raise for the military in nearly a decade \u2014 and boosts funding for a range of domestic programs, including a 5 percent increase for the National Institute of Health, a priority of both parties. \"I think we're in pretty good shape,\" he said. Still, many conservatives are unhappy. \"This bill funds things we said we wouldn't, like Planned Parenthood, but doesn't fund things we said we would, like the border security wall. That's unacceptable,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a leader of the conservative wing of the GOP who has made himself a candidate to lead House Republicans after the midterm elections. \"Republicans need to actually do what we said,\" Jordan said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., defended the bill, saying it fully funds the military while providing \"historic\" spending to fight the opioid epidemic, which takes the lives of more than 100 people in the U.S. every day. \"These are top priorities for the country, and we are ready to get this bill into law soon,\" Ryan said last week. Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other GOP lawmakers met with Trump earlier this month to plot strategy and urge the president not to force a shutdown. Trump's stance has zigzagged. At times he has said he won't allow a shutdown before the midterm elections. At other times, he's mused that closing the government may be good for him politically. \"If it happens, it happens. If it's about border security, I'm willing to do anything,\" Trump said during a meeting with top Republican lawmakers this month. McConnell insists there is \"zero\" chance of a shutdown and says a battle over the border wall should wait until after votes are cast in November. Ryan, for his part, said GOP leaders \"have a very good understanding with the president that we want to get our appropriations done. I'm confident our understanding will stick.\"",

            "article_content": "DHABEJI, Pakistan -- Hafeez Nawaz was 20 years old when he left his religious school in Karachi to join the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in Afghanistan. Three years later, he was back in Pakistan to carry out a deadly mission: With explosives strapped to his body, he blew himself up in the middle of an election rally last month, killing 149 people and wounding 300 others.  The attack in southwestern Baluchistan province near the Afghan border just days before Pakistan's July 25 parliamentary elections has cast an unwelcome spotlight on Nawaz's tiny village of Dhabeji, where the presence of an ISIS cell has brought the full weight of Pakistan's security apparatus down on its residents.  \"Now we are all under suspicion,\" said Nawaz's neighbor, who gave only his first name, Nadeem, for fear of the local police. \"The security agencies now consider Dhabeji a security threat area.\"  Nawaz's trajectory from religiously devout student to jihadi and suicide bomber is an all too familiar one in Pakistan.  Since battlefield successes routed ISIS from its strongholds in Syria and Iraq, hundreds of Pakistanis who traveled to join the extremists' so-called \"caliphate\" are unaccounted for and Pakistan's security personnel worry that they, like Nawaz, have gone underground waiting to strike.\u00a0 Sitting in his office in a compound surrounded by high walls and heavily armed guards, Karachi's counterterrorism department chief, Pervez Ahmed Chandio, said ISIS is the newest -- and deadliest -- front in Pakistan's decades-old war on terror.  \"It is one of the most dangerous threats facing Pakistan and we are ready to fight this war,\" he said.  It's the amorphous nature of ISIS that has counterterrorism officials like Chandio most worried. When one cell is disrupted another emerges, sometimes within weeks and often in an unrelated part of the country.  \"It's what they don't know that is the most worrying for counterterrorism departments around the country,\" said Mohammad Amir Rana, executive director of the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, which tracks militant movements in the region. \"Its hideouts, its structure, its strategy are all unknown. They are an invisible enemy who is defeated in one area, only to resurface in another.\"  A U.N. Security Council report earlier this year warned of the changing face of ISIS, saying the extremist group was \"entering a new phase, with more focus on less visible networks of individuals and cells acting with a degree of autonomy.\"  Hafeez Nawaz was such a case. Three years ago, he joined his older brother, Aziz, to study at Siddiquia Madrassa in Karachi's Shah Faisal Colony neighborhood, an area where the level of sectarian violence at the time was so brutal that even police could not enter. A crackdown by paramilitary Rangers has since led to the arrest and killing of hundreds of militants and criminals.  Today, the religious school is among 94 madrassas under surveillance in Karachi and elsewhere in southern Sindh province, Chandio said. They have been identified as breeding grounds for radicalism, schools where jihadis have emerged and that perpetrators of attacks attended. Many are financed by oil-rich Saudi Arabia to promote the rigid Wahabi sect of Islam practiced in the kingdom, Chandio said. The origin of the money, whether from the Saudi government or Saudi philanthropists, is not clear but the teachings at these schools espouse a rigid interpretation of Islam and the superiority of Sunni Islam.  It was at Siddiquia Mosque that Nawaz's brother, Aziz, fell in with a crowd of would-be jihadis and was persuaded to travel to Afghanistan's Spinboldak region on the border with Pakistan in 2014 to join the Taliban. But his allegiance was short-lived as commanders squabbled and Aziz returned to Pakistan. Once back home, he inducted his younger brother, Hafeez, into the jihadi circle but this time, it was ISIS that held sway, said Chandio, who was part of the counterterrorism squad that, using little more than body parts and grainy cell phone pictures, identified Hafeez Nawaz as the suicide bomber behind the July 13 election rally attack.  Chandio learned from the brothers' father that Nawaz and Aziz packed up their three sisters and their mother and moved them to Afghanistan in 2016 to live among an ISIS affiliate there. Two of the sisters have since married ISIS operatives. Their youngest brother, Shakoor, who was sent by their father a year later to plead with them to return, remains in Afghanistan, as does Aziz.  Chandio suspects 19-year-old Shakoor is now an ISIS operative and could be the next suicide bomber. He said Shakoor fits the criteria: a young man in his late teens or early 20s, religiously devout and susceptible to radicalization.\u00a0 Hafeez Nawaz was just 23 when he walked into the middle of the election rally in Baluchistan's Mustang area and detonated the suicide vest that sprayed shrapnel throughout the tent packed with local tribesmen.  Nawaz's father and his oldest brother, Haq Nawaz, are now in custody, caught trying to flee to Afghanistan, Chandio said.  Some analysts say the threat posed by ISIS in Pakistan is, at least in part, the result of the country's bewildering attitude toward the toxic mix of militant groups that operate in the country.  Since 2004, the Pakistani military has killed or driven out thousands of militants from their mountain redoubts in the tribal regions that border Afghanistan, suffering thousands of casualties in those battles. Yet Pakistan allows banned groups, some with a long history of sectarian violence, to re-emerge and operate under new names, and known militants to move about freely.  \"This is a sad reality of Pakistan: If militant leaders are useful to the state's interests, then they're free to do as they wish,\" said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Washington-based Wilson Center. \"So long as terrorist leaders roam free, there's still a very big terrorism problem.\"  A case in point is the outlawed Lashkar-e-Taiba, a global terrorist organization that has been resurrected as Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a group known to have sent scores of fighters to Syria and Iraq to bolster ISIS, according to Pakistani intelligence officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue.  Hafiz Saeed, the co-founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba, who has a $10 million U.S.-imposed bounty on his head, lives unrestricted in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's Punjab province, where 60 per cent of the country's 200 million people live.  Just last month, the U.S. State Department declared another of the group's senior commanders, Abdul Rehman al-Dakhil, a global terrorist, who poses \"a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.\"  Dakhil, who also now lives freely in Lahore, was arrested in Iraq in 2004 and held in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan until 2014, when he was returned to Pakistan, where he spent a brief stint in prison before being released.  \"ISIS is cut from the same basic ideological cloth as the other Islamist terror groups in Pakistan,\" said Kugelman. \"Marriages of convenience can never be ruled out, whether in terms of operational partnerships or cost-sharing. ...  We've seen a model of Afghanistan-focused ISIS members linking up with local facilitators in Pakistan to stage attacks.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in July that he would be campaigning \"six or seven days a week\" in the months before the midterm elections on behalf of \"all of these great people that do have a difficult race.\" Between last Saturday and this past Friday, Mr. Trump did not quite make it to six days a week, but he did appear at four campaign rallies in four states. He is slated to speak at another rally in Kentucky on Saturday.\u00a0 Although the president seems to enjoy holding these rallies, he has other motives in traveling the country, namely maintaining a Republican majority in Congress. Democrats are widely expected to retake the majority in the House of Representatives this year, and have a smaller chance of capturing the Senate. The president is not on the ballot this year, but he is making the midterm elections a referendum on his administration by rallying across the country and personalizing the races.\u00a0 The vulnerable Republicans he is stumping for, as well as the national party, are hoping that enthusiasm for Mr. Trump at his rallies will translate to turnout at the ballot box in November. \"This is also a referendum about me and the disgusting gridlock they'll put this country through,\" Mr. Trump said of Democrats at a rally in Mississippi earlier this month. Mr. Trump has recently campaigned primarily in states that he won in 2016, often making repeat appearances in a state. Since July, he has held rallies more than once in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Montana. He also rallied in Nevada and Minnesota, where he lost to Hillary Clinton by a narrow margin. The rallies follow a common structure for Mr. Trump. Crowds usually hear a litany of his accomplishments, such as negotiating new trade agreements like the United State-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and low unemployment numbers. The president also routinely condemns members of the gang MS-13 and promise a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. He also typically criticizes the \"fake news media.\" Mr. Trump's recent campaign appearances have differed from his post-election rallies in 2017 and from those he held earlier this year. He has emphasized attacks on Democrats, calling them the party of \"open borders\" and \"crime,\" whereas Republicans are the party of \"law and order\" and \"jobs, jobs, jobs.\" Mr. Trump even noted that he repeats this phrase without argument in many of his rallies. \"I go around saying Democrats are the party of crime, and no one even challenges me,\" he said at the rally in Ohio on Friday. He has also repeated that Democrats are \"bad people,\" and often uses the phrase that their purpose is to \"delay and obstruct.\" He has allocated time for condemning Democratic leaders in Congress, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. And since the controversy over Brett Kavanaugh's\u00a0confirmation\u00a0to the Supreme Court, he has also targeted Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee like Sen. Dianne Feinstein and \"Da Nang Dick\" -- Sen. Richard Blumenthal. Mr. Trump has used Democratic opposition to Kavanaugh's confirmation as a rallying cry.\u00a0 \"Their rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level that nobody has ever seen before,\" Mr. Trump said about Democrats in the Senate at a rally in Minnesota earlier this month. He called Democrats \"rule of the mob\" at the rally in Ohio Friday. The president has also placed more emphasis on voting than he has in the past, calling on rally attendees to register to vote or vote early for Republicans, to harness their enthusiasm while it's fresh.\u00a0 \"Get out in 2018 because you're voting for me in 2018,\" he said at a September rally in Missouri. Another unusual aspect of recent Trump rallies is how the president will often cede the stage to the candidate he is supporting. These candidates generally tend to focus their speech on their support for the president, and their opposition to their Democratic opponent. At the rally in Pennsylvania Thursday, Republican Rep. Mike Kelly said that Mr. Trump was \"the strongest president we have seen in our lifetime,\" and praised the president for presiding over the \"resurrection\" of the country, to wild cheers.

            "article_content": "CAIRO -- Egyptian authorities arrested a British journalist and expelled her from the country after threatening her with a military trial, The Times said on Saturday. The move comes as part of a heavy crackdown on media ahead of this month's presidential elections.  Bel Trew, who has been in Egypt for seven years, had been detained and faced \"sufficiently outlandish\" threats to suggest a misunderstanding over reporting she carried out in a central Cairo district, The Times (of London) said. She was expelled in late February. The British daily has been since attempting to bring about Trew's safe return to Cairo to cover the elections but to no avail.  \"It is now clear that the authorities have no intention of allowing her to return,\" The Times said in a statement. Egyptian authorities were not immediately available for comment.  Trew said in an account on the Times' website that she has been listed as a persona non-grata and that Cairo authorities threatened to re-arrest her if she attempts to return.  She said her reporting in the district of Shoubra was part of a story on a migrant boat that disappeared two years ago. An informer seems to have reported her to the police, she added. She was stopped shortly after she left a cafe where she was conducting an interview.\u00a0 \"The taxi had just pulled away from the caf\u00e9 ... when a minibus of plain-clothes police officers cut us off. Five men jumped out and took me to a nearby police station,\" she said, adding that she provided the authorities with the audio recording of the interview. \"It was either ignored and not listened to - or listened to and ignored,\" she said.\u00a0 Egypt has often detained, jailed and prosecuted journalists under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the military's 2013 overthrow of elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, after mass protests against his one-year divisive rule.  Advocacy group Reporters Without Borders ranked Egypt as 161 out of 180 countries on their 2017 World Press Freedom Index.  The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists ranked Egypt among the top worst jailers of journalists in a December report. It says some 20 reporters remain detained; several face charges of spreading \"false news.\"  Some 500 websites have been blocked since last year including many run by rights groups, sites critical of the government and the VPN services that help users bypass the blocks.  Pro-el-Sissi businessmen have also expanded their reach into an already cowed private media, according to Reporters Without Borders. The group says security forces maintain a list of \"wanted\" journalists they have sometimes even forcibly disappeared, and are especially keen to crack down on individuals who sell video content to opposition media abroad.  The government's stepped up warnings to the media ahead of the 26-28 March presidential election, in which el-Sissi faces no serious challenge after a string of hopefuls were forced out of the race or arrested. His only challenger is a little-known candidate who supports him.  Early March saw some of the harshest official rhetoric to date taking aim at the press. The country's chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadeq, described the media as \"forces of evil\" -- one of el-Sissi's hallmark phrases -- saying they have been trying to \"undermine the security and safety of the nation through the broadcast and publication of lies and false news.\" El-Sissi himself described any defamation of the country's security forces as \"high treason.\"  Shortly thereafter, a bill was proposed in parliament criminalizing any statements authorities define as insults toward the armed forces or police, with penalties of at least three-year jail terms and fines upward of 10,000 Egyptian pounds (or $567).  Egyptian authorities have also published a list of telephone numbers for citizens to alert reports they view as undermining security or spreading false news.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "MEXICO CITY --\u00a0Angry and frustrated over corruption and violence, Mexican voters delivered a tidal wave presidential election victory to leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, giving him a broad mandate to upend the political establishment and govern for the poor. An official quick count from electoral authorities late Sunday forecast that Lopez Obrador would win with between 53 percent and 53.8 percent of the votes, a remarkable margin not seen in the country for many years. Early Monday, with about 20 percent of the votes counted, Lopez Obrador's advantage was close to the quick count's statistical sample. A prominent exit poll predicted his party allies were poised to score big victories in congressional races, possibly winning absolute majorities in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Lopez Obrador, who campaigned on vows to transform Mexico and oust the \"mafia of power\" ruling the country, rode widespread voter anger and discontent with the governing Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, of President Enrique Pena Nieto and had led opinion polls since the beginning of the campaign. The PRI, which dominated Mexican politics for nearly the entire 20th century and recaptured the presidency in 2012, was set to suffer heavy losses not just for the presidency but in other races as well. In brief remarks at a hotel in central Mexico City, Lopez Obrador called for reconciliation after a polarizing campaign and promised profound change but with respect for the law and constitutional order. \"I confess that I have a legitimate ambition: I want to go down in history as a good president of Mexico,\" said Lopez Obrador, who won after losses in the previous two elections. \"I desire with all my soul to raise the greatness of our country on high.\" Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico! U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted congratulations: \"I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!\" Lopez Obrador spoke of support for migrants and said the most forgotten and humble people of Mexico will be given preference in his government. He said he will seek a relationship of \"friendship and respect\" with the United States.  Former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Roberta Jacobson told CBS News on Sunday, before his win was clear, that Lopez Obrador as president could lead to a more positive relationship with the United States, even as President Trump and Mexican officials continue to butt heads over regional issues including\u00a0trade, drug trafficking and the border wall. \"One of the things that he -- both in my discussions with him and many of his conversations and advisers' conversations ahead of these elections -- have emphasized is the relationship with the United States and that it be positive,\" Jacobson said Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" \"They're going to work hard on that, which does not mean it's going to be easier than it has been with the current Mexican government. I think there a number of issues on which it's going to be difficult and maybe harder,\" Jacobson said. She added that Lopez Obrador \"has been at pains to reassure people that he takes this relationship seriously, that he does not think that it needs to\u2026 descend into insult, and he has the leftist credentials to stand up politely in a way that I think he's got the credibility to do that.\" The president-in-waiting, whose term will begin Dec. 1, devoted much of his speech to appealing to citizens of all stripes and seeking to reassure those who have eyed his candidacy nervously. \"This new national project will seek to establish an authentic democracy and we do not intend to establish a dictatorship,\" Lopez Obrador said. \"The changes will be profound, but in accordance with established order.\" Conservative Ricardo Anaya of a right-left coalition and the PRI's Jose Antonio Meade acknowledged defeat shortly after polls closed nationwide. The quick count had them around 22 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Lopez Obrador's supporters began wild celebrations in Mexico City, cruising up and down the central Paseo de la Reforma boulevard honking horns to the tune of \"Viva Mexico!\" and waving Mexican flags from car windows and moon roofs. Thousands poured into the sprawling main square known as the Zocalo, where the 64-year-old former mayor of the capital had called on his backers to rally. Many danced to the trills of mariachi music. Retired teacher Susana Zuniga beamed and said the country was experiencing a moment similar to the Mexican Revolution a century ago. \"The people are fed up. That is what brought us to this,\" she said. Lopez Obrador said individual and property rights would be guaranteed, promised respect for the autonomy of the Bank of Mexico and said his government will maintain financial and fiscal discipline. He said contracts obtained under energy reforms passed under President Enrique Pena Nieto will be scrutinized for any corruption or illegality, but otherwise contracts will be honored. \"There will be no confiscation or expropriation of assets. ... Eradicating corruption will be the principal mission,\" he said. Rather than the use of force to fight spiraling violence, he will look to fix root causes such as inequality and poverty. \"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice,\" Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. \"The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador,\" said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"He's been able to capture the mantle of the person who's on the outside who wants change.\" In a speech to the huge crowd in the Zocalo, he struck a moderate tone, stressing a need to act respectfully, to maintain economic and financial stability. He also pledged to increase support payments for the elderly and to give scholarships or paid apprenticeships to young people. \"Now that he has won, he cannot fail this new generation that believes in him,\" said Mariano Bartolini, a 29-year-old lawyer who voted for Lopez Obrador in the northwestern city of Rosarito, near Tijuana. \"It is thanks to us young people who are supporting him that he was able to get more votes than he did in past elections.\"",

            "article_content": "LAHORE, Pakistan --\u00a0The deadliest attacks in Pakistan's troubled election campaign killed at least 132 people, including a candidate, on Friday just before the arrest of disgraced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif upon his return to the country. In the southwestern province of Baluchistan, a suicide bomber killed 128 people, including a politician running for a provincial legislature. Four others died in a strike in Pakistan's northwest, spreading panic in the country.\u00a0 The attacks came hours before Sharif returned from London along with his daughter Maryam to face a 10-year prison sentence on corruption charges, anti-corruption officials said. Maryam Sharif faces seven years in jail.  He was taken into custody to serve his sentence however he is expected to appeal and seek bail. It wasn't clear when his appeal would be filed but he has until Monday.  In the southern town of Mastung, candidate Siraj Raisani and 127 others died when a suicide bomber blew himself up amid scores of supporters who had gathered at a rally. Raisani is the brother of the former Baluchistan chief minister, Aslam Raisani. Caretaker Home Minister Agha Umar Bungalzai told The Associated Press another 300 people were wounded in Friday's bombing.\u00a0   The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack in Baluchistan   in a statement carried on its Amaq news agency. The group gave no reason for the bombing. In recent years, ISIS has carried out a number of the attack in the region on the border with Afghanistan, according to BBC News. Security has improved, however, since the military managed to clear large portions of territory. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the Bannu attack that killed four people. \u00a0 The U.S. State Department in a statement strongly condemned this week's attacks on political candidates and their supporters in Pakistan.  \"These attacks are cowardly attempts to deprive the Pakistani people of their democratic rights,\" it said. \"We will continue to stand with the people of Pakistan and the broader South Asia region in their fight against terrorism.\"  Meanwhile, Sharif arrived in the eastern city of Lahore from London where he was visiting his ailing wife when a Pakistani court convicted him and his daughter of corruption.  Sharif's son-in-law is currently serving his one-year prison sentence on the same charge, which stems from the purchase of luxury apartments in Britain that the court said were bought with illegally acquired money.  Ahead of his return, police swept through Lahore, arresting scores of Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League party workers to prevent them from greeting him at the airport.\u00a0 Barbed wire was strung across some roads leading to the Lahore airport on Friday and barricades were positioned at the roadside ready to close off main boulevards should crowds start to gather.  In a video message Friday reportedly from aboard his aircraft en route to Pakistan, Sharif said he was returning knowing he would be taken directly to prison.  Sharif has been banned from participating in politics, and his brother Shahbaz Sharif now heads his Pakistan Muslim League and is campaigning for re-election on July 25.  In a televised appeal to supporters from London earlier this week, Sharif said he was not afraid of prison and asked people to vote for his party. He also used the opportunity to again criticize Pakistan's powerful military, which has ruled the country directly or indirectly for most of its 71-year history, saying Pakistan now has a \"state above the state.\"  During his term in office, Sharif criticized the military's involvement in civilian affairs and its efforts in fighting extremists.  Pakistani and international rights groups have accused the military of seeking to maintain its influence in Pakistani politics by keeping Sharif out of power. The military denied the accusations saying their assistance in carrying out the elections was requested by Pakistan's Election Commission. The army will deploy 350,000 security personnel to polling stations throughout the country on election day.  Underscoring the security threat, were Friday's bombings the first of which killed four people in the northwest near the election rally of a senior politician from an Islamist party.  The explosion targeted candidate Akram Khan Durrani, who escaped unhurt, and wounded 20 people, said local police chief Rashid Khan.  Durrani is running in the July 25 vote against popular former lawmaker Imran Khan. He is a candidate of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, an election alliance of radical religious groups.  The attacks came days after a suicide bomber dispatched by the Pakistani Taliban killed secular politician Haroon Ahmed Bilour and 20 others at his rally in the northwestern city of Peshawar.  Former lawmaker Imran Khan, who hopes to become the next prime minister, condemned Friday's attack against his opponent, Durrani. In a tweet, he said there seems to be a conspiracy to sabotage the July 25 vote. But he said the people of Pakistan will not allow anything to prevent \"historic\" elections from taking place.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "MOSCOW -- President Vladimir Putin ridiculed the U.S. indictment of 13 Russians in a television interview broadcast Monday, scoffing at the notion that a person described as his chef could interfere with a U.S. presidential election. Special counsel Robert Mueller in February charged Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman dubbed \"Putin's chef,\" and 12 others in an alleged conspiracy to meddle in the 2016 election.  Putin dismissed the charges as \"ridiculous\" during an interview with Austrian public broadcaster ORF broadcast late Monday.  \"How low the Western information and political environment has fallen if a restaurateur from Russia could influence elections in the United States or a European country,\" the Russia leader said.  The 13 people indicted are accused of an elaborate plot to disrupt the U.S. election that allegedly included running a huge social media campaign from their headquarters in St. Petersburg, dubbed the \"'troll farm.\"  Prigozhin has been dubbed \"Putin's chef\" by Russian media because his restaurants and catering businesses have hosted the Kremlin leader's dinners with foreign dignitaries.  Putin told ORF that the Russian government has no connection to Prigozhin's activities. When pressed further, he pointed to Hungarian-American financier and philanthropist George Soros, alleging that Soros meddles in the affairs of various nations while \"our American friends often tell me that America has nothing to do with it.\"\u00a0 \"Ask the (U.S.) Department of State why he does it,\" Putin said. \"The Department of State would tell you that it has no relation to that, it's Mr. Soros' private business. Well, here it's Mr. Prigozhin's private business.\"  Asked about his interactions with U.S. President Donald Trump, Putin said political infighting in Washington was hampering their contacts.  In a phone call to Putin in March, Mr. Trump proposed their holding a summit. U.S. and Russian officials haven't discussed specifics yet.  \"In my view, it's a result of the acute political struggle continuing in the U.S.,\" Putin said.  He emphasized that his meeting with Mr. Trump would be important as an opportunity to discuss arms control and preventing a new arms race. Putin also discussed the upcoming summit between Mr. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un set for June 12 in Singapore, saying Russia pins \"great hopes\" on the meeting.\u00a0 When asked during the interview with broadcaster ORF if he thinks a nuclear showdown between the U.S. and North Korea is possible Putin said, \"I do not even want to think about it.\" \"Russia, of all countries, is not interested in it because North Korea is our neighbor,\" Putin said, according to a transcript of the interview published by the Russian presidency. \"Incidentally, one of the nuclear test sites, the one that I think North Korea is shutting down, is located, if my memory does not fail me, within 190 kilometers of the Russian border. This is something absolutely real for us.\"\u00a0 \"Therefore, we will do all we can to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" he added.",

            "article_content": "White House press secretary Sarah Sanders delivered a press briefing Tuesday afternoon, as President Trump and Congress negotiate over a partial government funding bill with just a few days before the government runs out of funding for several major departments. Sanders said in an interview with Fox News Tuesday morning that administration does not want to shut down the government over funding for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, contradicting comments by Mr. Trump last week. Sanders said that the president has asked every executive agency to look for funding for a potential border wall if Democrats do not agree to provide enough funding in a spending bill. She said that the White House was \"disappointed\" that the Senate had not yet passed a funding bill. \"At this point, the senate has thrown out a lot of ideas. We're disappointed in the fact that they've yet to actually vote on something and pass something. So when they do that, we'll make a determination on whether or not we're going to sign that,\" Sanders said. Sanders departed the briefing room after only ten minutes, angering reporters. \"This is your job, Sarah!\" one reporter shouted as she left the room. Sanders' last press briefing was in November. Funding for several agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, runs out Dec. 21. Mr. Trump has requested $5 billion for a border wall, but Congressional Democrats say they would only vote for a bill which would grant $1.6 billion for border security. In an Oval Office meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Mr. Trump said that he was \"proud to shut down the government for border security.\" However, Sanders said on Fox News Tuesday that the White House had been in communication with House and Senate members on both sides of the aisle, and that there are \"other ways that we can get to that $5 billion\" for wall funding. \"There is certainly a number of different funding sources that we've identified that we can use that we can couple with the money would that be given through congressional appropriations that would help us get to the $5 billion the president needs in order to protect our borders,\" Sanders said. Sanders delivered a press briefing as former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn appeard in court to be sentenced for lying to the FBI about conversations he had with Russian Envoy Sergey Kislyak. The sentencing was delayed, after his lawyers took up Judge Emmet Sullivan on his repeated offers to do so. The delay will now give Flynn the opportunity to cooperate further with the government. Mr. Trump tweeted about Flynn's sentencing Tuesday: \"Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!\" Sanders reiterated the administration's support for Flynn, and said that Flynn's sentencing was a matter for the judge. She said that Flynn's lies to the FBI had nothing to do with Mr. Trump, even though the Flynn lied to the FBI while in the White House. \"The actions he engaged in had nothing to do with the president,\" Sanders said, even though the interview was within the White House. She also condemned the FBI for not informing Flynn that it was illegal to lie to the FBI before they interviewed him. Sanders said of Mr. Trump's tweet Tuesday morning that \"it is perfectly acceptable to make a positive comment\" about Flynn ahead of sentencing. The special counsel's office has recommended that Flynn receive zero to six months of incarceration due to his \"substantial assistance\" in the investigation. Sanders also responded a tweet by Mr. Trump Tuesday morning recommending that the Federal Reserve not raise interest rates, saying that it was not a direct order to an independent agency. \"He's the president of the United States and not only does he have the ability to give his opinion, he should give his opinion,\" Sanders said. New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood announced Tuesday that Mr. Trump has agreed to shut down his family's embattled Trump Foundation, following investigators' allegations the charity misused funds by directing them to Mr. Trump or his businesses. The attorney general will review and approve the process, including approving the charities slated to receive the foundation's remaining assets. Sanders did not discuss the announcement on the Trump Foundation, referring to the Trump organization. The Trump administration also announced on Tuesday that it is banning bump stocks, which make it easier to fire rounds from a semi-automatic weapon to \"bump\" the trigger faster, by rolling out a regulation amending the law and definition of illegal machine guns to include bump stocks.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Nancy Pelosi often quotes Abraham Lincoln saying public sentiment is everything. It's a theory that will be put to the test when the new House Democratic majority gavels in this week and votes to end the government shutdown without money for President Donald Trump's border wall with Mexico. The high-stakes move to reopen the government will be the first big battle between Trump and Pelosi as Democrats come into control ready to reassert the power of the legislative branch and confront the White House. Mr. Trump is counting on public support as he holds out for $5 billion to build the wall. He's signaled he's in no rush to give up on a signature campaign issue as he launches his own re-election bid in 2020. But Pelosi just as strongly believes the public will be on Democrats' side as they try to get government working again, and move on to health care and other priorities \u2014 including oversight of the White House. As the shutdown drags into a second week, shuttering popular Smithsonian museums and creating hardship among some 800,000 federal workers, the stalemate is fast becoming a test of wills rarely seen when Republicans had monopoly control of government in Washington. \"We're going to do our job,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., the incoming chairman of the Rules Committee, vowing to pass legislation to re-open government. \"The president should take 'yes' for an answer and go back to tweeting.\" As Republicans relinquish their hold on Congress, and House Speaker Paul Ryan gives up the gavel, the White House is eager for a showdown with Pelosi believing the crisis will tarnish the opening of the new legislative session, and with it, her expected return to the speaker's office. Trump is committed for the long haul, according to administration officials unauthorized to speak publicly and granted anonymity. After early threats to shut down government over the wall, he now believes he's got public opinion and, at very least, his base of supporters behind him. The president has not said he would veto the Democratic legislation, if it lands on his desk. But the idea of clouding Pelosi's speakership only emboldens Trump, the officials said. A prolonged crisis could hobble House Democrats' ability to launch their agenda, which includes investigations of the president and oversight of his administration, including Russian interference in the election. Rather than reach out for negotiations, the president has been holed up at the White House, tweeting. \"Veterans on President Trump's handling of Border Security - 62% Approval Rating,\" Trump tweeted Sunday, referring to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 115,000 midterm voters \u2014 including more than 4,000 current and former service members \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago. It found that veterans overall approved of Trump's job performance, but women, the fastest growing demographic group in the military, defied that trend with a majority disapproving of him. Other Republicans, though, are more wary of the White House's approach. Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said Sunday a prolonged standoff only makes all sides look \"silly.\" \"If we blame each other, this could last a long, long time,\" Shelby said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation.\" \u2033It's not a question of who wins, who loses ... Nobody wins in a shutdown, we all lose.\" Pelosi, meanwhile, shows no signs of wavering, eager to both re-open government and to launch the Democratic agenda. When the House gavels open Thursday, one of the first votes will be on Pelosi's return as speaker. The California Democrat is confident she has the support needed to win. Democrats in the House are preparing three legislative options to keep government running Day One, aides said. One would be a temporary measure, similar to the Senate-passed bill before Christmas, to keep border security at existing funding levels, $1.3 billion, and re-open government through Feb. 8, but no money for the wall. The others would also keep border funds at current levels, without wall money, but for the remainder of the fiscal year, though Sept. 30. On the other side of the Capitol, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has shown little daylight with Pelosi, and has been able to hold Democrats together, effectively neutralizing the White House's attempt to split his ranks, even after their November losses in the Senate. Schumer immediately began approaching Democratic senators after the midterm election to hear their views on Trump's $5 billion demand for the wall, according to a person familiar with the talks but unauthorized to speak publicly. He quickly learned that even the most vulnerable senators from states Trump won in 2016, while favoring border security, did not want to spend the money on the wall. One red-state Democrat, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, said Sunday that Trump campaigned on having Mexico pay for the wall, but if the president is now saying, \"We're still going to build the wall, but were going to have the American taxpayer pay for it \u2014 we're going to use the American taxpayer like an ATM machine \u2014 that's not the direction to go.\" Republicans, who will still control the Senate under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have not signaled their next move. They have largely left the negotiations to Trump and Democrats, and it's unclear if McConnell would consider any of the bills the House, under Pelosi, could pass. Republican senators are eager to get back to confirming Trump's judicial nominees, and they say they don't want to consider any more shutdown legislation unless they know Trump would sign it into law, after the president rejected their Senate-passed bill. House Democrats are pushing forward with other priorities in the first weeks of the new Congress, including a Rules package that will impose new transparency and oversight on legislative operations \u2014 including a requirement that all bills be considered in committees before coming to the floor for votes. They're also planning early moves on health care, including a resolution to fight the legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Rep. Lucille Roybal Allard, D-Calif., the incoming chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee that handles Homeland Security, said in an interview that her office is preparing legislation to keep government running and moving forward. \"Our goal is to make sure we move on our promises,\" she said, noting that the public has \"tremendous influence on what happens\" in Washington. And if the shutdown drags into the new Congress? \"I don't even want to think about that.\" ___ Associated Press White House correspondent Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Trump's border wall will be a key topic for debate as lawmakers return to Washington this week for what's known as the lame-duck session, which includes returning lawmakers and who are retiring or who lost their re-election bids. Lawmakers are running out of time to address the looming deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown. In less than two weeks Congress must pass seven spending bills that keep several government departments up and running.\u00a0 Five of the 12 annual spending bills have been passed by the House and Senate and signed by the president, funding operations for those departments through Sept. 2019. The remaining seven have not, and the president is threatening a veto if the funding for his border wall is not included. \"Could there be a shutdown? There certainly could,\" the president told reporters last week on Thanksgiving, implying a veto threat over funding for his signature campaign issue. \u00a0\"And it will be about border security, of which the wall is a part.\" Among the government agencies that would be impacted by a partial shutdown are the Homeland Security, Justice, State, Agriculture and Commerce Departments.\u00a0 Any partial shutdown, should it occur, would begin on Dec. 8 if Congress does not pass the seven remaining appropriation bills. One reason Mr. Trump is pushing hard for the wall funding now is that he's likely to face even more resistance to wall spending once Democrats take control of the House in January. Even though they're in the minority in the Senate, Democrats hold some power in fights over the spending bills. These bills require 60 votes in the Senate, and because Republicans currently only hold 51 seats, they need the support of nine Democrats. Democrats could try to bargain for a vote on legislation protecting special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said he might try to tie a measure protecting Mueller's investigation to the must-pass spending legislation. \"We want a couple of things,\" Schumer told reporters earlier this month in pressing for the Mueller bill, while nothing that \"the Republicans are in charge, and if the government shuts down, it's on their back.\"\u00a0 Other issues on Congress' agenda for the final weeks of this year include the farm bill, which expired at the end of September. If Congress can't agree on a new farm bill by the end of the year, it will have to extend the 2014 law. The farm bill is renewed every five years and covers a wide range of issues, including price stabilization for farmers, food stamps and forest management policies. Some Republicans are also calling for a vote on the trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), before Democrats take control of the House. Otherwise, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Penn., said in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed that he fears Democrats will demand changes \"that would undermine trade\" between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, even requiring the reopening of negotiations. In recent weeks, lawmakers have pressed for action on sentencing reform, an issue that could gain bipartisan support. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, has not committed to bringing up the bill. Congress must weigh that measure \"against the other things that absolutely have to be accomplished, one of which is how we're going to fund the government, the other is a farm bill,\" McConnell told reporters earlier this month. \"And so we don't have a whole lot of time left.\"",

I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION. CHUCK SCHUMER: This may have been the most chaotic week of what's undoubtedly the most chaotic presidency ever in the history of the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: That observation came from the Senate Democratic leader. But last week, several stunning decisions made by President Trump shocked even his closest advisors, Republicans, and U.S. allies. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Walls work, whether we like it or not. They work better than anything.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The President's demand for five billion dollars in border wall funding blew up an agreement to keep key parts of the government running. Instead, it's a Christmas shutdown that could last well into the New Year. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're totally prepared for a very long shutdown. MARGARET BRENNAN: Plus, the snap decision that sent shockwaves around the world. As the President ignored the advice of his cabinet, military leaders and some of his closest allies on Capitol Hill and announced by Twitter that he's pulling U.S. troops out of Syria and making plans to cut our forces in Afghanistan in half. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have won against ISIS. We've beaten them and we've beaten them badly. MARGARET BRENNAN: But ISIS hasn't been beaten and the move will impact international efforts in the war on terror. Retired General James Mattis became the first defense secretary to resign in protest of a commander-in-chief's decision. Plus, Brett McGurk, the U.S. diplomat coordinating the fight against ISIS among our allies, quit. Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul supports the President's decision. The new number three in the House Republican leadership Wyoming's Liz Cheney opposes it. We'll talk with them both. Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons will also be here. And we'll honor a sixty-eight-year tradition with our year-ender CBS News correspondents' panel. We'll talk about what's happened this week and look ahead to 2019. It's all coming up on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Congress has gone home for Christmas but President Trump has cancelled his trip to Florida and will stay at the White House as almost four hundred thousand federal workers are now on furlough and another four hundred thousand are working without pay until at least Thursday when the Senate returns. Some national parks and tourist sites have been affected by the shutdown, but other government services will continue, including TSA screeners and the Postal Service. We begin today with Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He sits on the Homeland Security and Foreign Relations Committees. And he joins us this morning from Lake Jackson, Texas. Merry Christmas to you, Sir. SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky/@RandPaul): Thank you. Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been warning a lot about fiscal responsibility and the staggering twenty-two-trillion-dollar debt. So with that in mind, do you intend to vote for any kind of spending bill that includes billions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers without any offset? SENATOR RAND PAUL: No. In fact, I've never voted for any of these large spending bills that puts all of the spending together. Because we have a trillion-dollar deficit this year and Republicans, as you recall-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So the border wall is-- is-- SENATOR RAND PAUL: --we promised that we were going to spend less money. MARGARET BRENNAN: The border wall is not something you will vote for? SENATOR RAND PAUL: We promised to spend less money and so I won't vote for it. Well, I would if we were to offset it with cuts somewhere. And so what I've advised is we spend about fifty billion dollars a year in Afghanistan. I think we should declare victory years ago. I think we should come home and out of that fifty billion dollars in savings I think we would have enough for a border wall and security. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move, though, to foreign policy where you do seem to be aligned with the President. You've been on a tweet storm this morning saying, President's decision to pull out of Syria and cut our troop presence in Afghanistan in half, you said \"the entire foreign policy establishment of Washington, DC, who two years ago were swearing Trump was going to start multiple nuclear wars. Now they're mad because he is stopping two wars. How about you just admit you hate the President, love war and have been wrong for the last twenty years on every part of foreign policy?\" Who are you referring to because the defense secretary and the top diplomat handling ISIS both resigned over these decisions? SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I think that we should look at some of the statements of the people who are advocating that we stay in Afghanistan forever and that we also stay now in Syria with no sort of determined end. General Mattis, even General Mattis said that there's no military solution to Syria, and he's also said there's no military solution to Afghanistan. How do you think our young soldiers feel? I have members of my family that are going over there soon, how do you think they feel being sent to Afghanistan when your generals are saying there's no military solution? So I think the burden is really on Mattis and others who want perpetual war to explain why if there is no military solution we're sending more troops. I think the onus is really on them to explain themselves. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that issue, though, it's not perpetual war, the argument has been from diplomats that you need the credible threat of military force in order to get people to the negotiating table. What is the incentive now in Afghanistan-- SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, this is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --or Syria to have any kind of negotiation if there's no leverage? SENATOR RAND PAUL: We've been there seventeen years. We think now we are going to take one more village and we'll get a better negotiated deal? Does anybody remember Vietnam-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's what the Trump administration says-- SENATOR RAND PAUL: That was the strategy of Vietnam for years after year after year in Vietnam was to take one more village and we'll get a better negotiated deal. No, they waited us out and the Taliban are going to wait us out. They know we will eventually leave and leave we must. I mean I don't think we have enough money to be paying to build and rebuild and build and rebuild Afghanistan. The President is right and I think the people agree with him. Let's rebuild America. Let's spend that money here at home. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, if you accept the premise of what you just laid out here and-- and some people do agree that particularly in Syria, two thousand troops and two dozen diplomats can't make a difference. So if you accept that, though, if you look at what the defense secretary put in his resignation letter, what you're hearing here is-- is concern about how it's being done, about abandoning allies, about not having a process-- SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --about not being clear-eyed regarding America's enemies. SENATOR RAND PAUL: But here's the problem-- I know-- MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to that? SENATOR RAND PAUL: I know. But here-- here is the problem with all of these generals. They're like, \"Oh, it's precipitous.\" We've been there seventeen years. We've been in the Middle East most of that time. It's not precipitous. The President promised when we went into Syria, our goal was to wipe out ISIS. We took ninety-nine percent of the land, they're on the run, can the people who live there not do anything? We spent trillions of dollars arming the entire Middle East, arming Afghan army, can they not do anything? Do we have to do everything? We defeated ISIS. But now you have the-- the hawks in the administration and throughout Congress saying, \"Oh, now we have to wait until Russia and Iran leave Syria.\" Well, that was never our goal and it's never going to happen. So those people are advocating for perpetual war. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was the goal articulated by the national security adviser to the President, John Bolton. That is what he said U.S. policy was. SENATOR RAND PAUL: It-- it was never the goal-- well, it was never-- that's a new goal. That's what you call mission creep. The mission has now changed, that we're going to wait till Iran leaves and Russia leaves. Well, the President told them that's not his mission and that was never the mission. The mission was to wipe out ISIS and we did succeed. And the thing is it's incredibly bold to win a war and come home. That's what the people want. If you poll the American people, it's sixty to seventy percent of people ready to get out of Afghanistan. And I'll bet you the same of Syria if you ask the people. It's only the people in Washington, the armchair generals, that want to keep us at war forever and people, Americans, are tired of it. We want that money here at home and we want to create jobs, roads, bridges here at home not in Afghanistan. MARGARET BRENNAN: The concern raised by people like Brett McGurk who-- who was the President's diplomat handling the anti-ISIS coalition is that if you move out too quickly, if you agree we're going to draw down, at least have a plan on how to do it. At least, do it in a way that doesn't abandon allies. And, in fact, he warned in his resignation letter that this could create a vacuum that would allow terrorist groups like the Islamic State to re-emerge and in other-- other words, we'll have to go back in a few years. SENATOR RAND PAUL: That will always be true. What-- what-- that-- that statement will always be true. That statement will be true in fifteen years. The place is a mess. I mean, they've been fighting each other for a thousand years. Sunni and Shia have been fighting each other since Battle of Karbala in 832 AD. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is ISIS. SENATOR RAND PAUL: They're going to fight each other until the end of time. It's all of them. It's-- it's a inter-complicated mess that has to do with Sunni extremism versus Shia extremism, and also some other various battles in between. But if we wait until there's potent-- no potential for anybody fighting each other when we leave, we will be there forever. But here is what we need to do. And here is the real problem, we have so politicized the relationship with Russia that there isn't a Democrat in the land that is for any kind of negotiation with Russian ally because they know it's an anti-Trump position to be heaping on Russia. Russia is a big player. If we don't talk to Russia about Syria, we will never come to a resolution. Iran is a player. We actually have to talk to Iran about-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR RAND PAUL: --Syria, as well. Assad is a player. We have-- we can't just say Assad is going to go. He won the war. These people have their head in the sand and they just want to send two thousand troops there. They become a trip wire to a possibility of a much-expanded war involving Russia and Iran. And that would be a huge mistake-- mistake. I don't think the American people want another big war in the Middle East.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The Pentagon and State Department say there are tens of thousands of ISIS fighters still in Syria. How can you credibly say mission accomplished? Do you think ISIS has been defeated? SENATOR RAND PAUL: Right. I think the numbers are wildly inflated and nobody knows. I think there are maybe ten thousand so-called radicals. And these are radicals. They are in Idlib and they are surrounded by Turks, Syrians, Kurds others. And I don't think they're going anywhere. And right now there's not a lot of heated battles going on. But my question is why do American young men and women always have to lay our lives down? To the people of Iraq, are they incapable of doing anything? And here's the thing. Muslims need to ultimately police Muslim lands. When Americans are there and we kill someone who lives there, they see it as a religious affront and they see it as the Pagans have come to take their land and for everyone we kill, we create ten to a one hundred more. So it isn't working. We have-- have supplied them all with money we've given them uniforms we've given them weapons. They need to step up and they need to eradicate these violent people from their midst. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Paul, thank you. SENATOR RAND PAUL: Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons. He joins us from Wilmington this morning. Welcome to FACE THE NATION. I know there is a lot that you want to respond to their very quickly on the shutdown, White House says they will accept less than five billion; Democrats offering 1.3 for this border wall. How does this end? SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-Delaware/@ChrisCoons): Well, it ends when President Trump recognizes that the bipartisan agreement we came to just last Wednesday that the Senate voted unanimously on is the agreement that ultimately he's going to have to accept. It's President Trump who two weeks ago said, \"I will cheer on a government shutdown, I will champion a government shutdown, I will take responsibility for a shutdown\" and here we are with a government shutdown. There is frankly no path towards his getting five billion dollars in American taxpayer money to meet his campaign promise of a big beautiful wall with Mexico. There is a path towards our responsibly appropriating about 1.3 billion for border security. Margaret, I'll remind you the administration hasn't spent, yet, the 1.3 billion we appropriated for border security this year. I think the President simply needs to hear yes, and we all need to move forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see what happens in the New Year and possibly the new Congress there. Back to foreign policy. I know you heard a lot from Senator Paul there. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Yes, I did. MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to what he laid out which is just the President is doing what he was elected to do these are forever wars. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I could not disagree more. I think by abruptly withdrawing from Syria, President Trump is handing a great big Christmas gift to Vladimir Putin of Russia and to the Ayatollah Khamenei of Iran. And it's a pretty guide post for me when there is a foreign policy decision that's cheered by Vladimir Putin and Rand Paul, that's a pretty good sign, it's a terrible idea. On a bipartisan basis members of the Senate are pleading with President Trump to reconsider, to think that possibly his most senior generals and most experienced military leaders might be right. We shouldn't fumble the ball on the five-yard line. The mission against ISIS where the United States built a coalition of dozens of countries is on the verge of winning, of completely shutting down ISIS in Syria. And for us to withdraw right now and abandon our Kurdish allies paves a highway for control of Syria for either Iran and Russia or Turkey. None of which is a good outcome. And profoundly disorients our allies who came into this fight alongside us and weren't consulted and weren't given enough of a heads up. I am concerned about the security of Israel what it does to Israel to have Iran strengthened on its immediate border, I'm concerned about the message this sends how reliable an ally the United States is, and I am concerned what it says about our ability to stick to a fight until it's won. The fight against ISIS is not won. And Brett McGurk's resignation and Secretary Jim Mattis' resignation and his dramatic letter of resignation make that very clear. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you talk about that letter of resignation, the-- the defense secretary saying, it's not just pulling out, it's this broader principles-- SENATOR CHRIS COONS: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --of abandoning alliances. The boarder principles he says of being clear eyed and recognizing threats from Russia and China. For any new nominee who steps into that role potentially, what are you going to do if the defense secretary nominated agrees with the President? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, one of the things that was most striking about Secretary Jim Mattis was how broadly he was supported on a bipartisan basis. Someone who spent forty years both in combat commands and in policy commands and was at the most senior and seasoned level of the American armed forces. If the President instead chooses an America first defense secretary, we will have confirmation hearings; we'll hopefully get the chance to ask him or her probing questions. But if it's someone who doesn't believe in the importance of our alliances as Secretary Mattis did, if this is someone who doesn't have a clear-eyed view of the very real threat to our security opposed by both Russia and China then they won't get my support and they won't enjoy this sort of board bipartisan support that Secretary Mattis has for so long. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Coons, I also want to ask you about something, I know you've raised a red flag about and we have seen a real rough year lately for stocks, certainly a rough week. And markets were rattled by some of these reports that the President is considering trying to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve, I know the treasury secretary and chief of staff both say he doesn't have the power to do it. You have warned about the dangers of any kind of interference, is there anything that Congress can do to stop this? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, my friend and Republican and conservative joined with me in sending a letter to the President directly a few weeks ago saying, please don't criticize Jay Powell and the-- the Fed their decision making, that's an abrupt change in practice by the President to publicly criticize their decision making but now he's reportedly considering an even bolder and less wise move in considering firing Jay Powell or demoting him. That got a very sharp response from the markets. This was the worst week for the American stock markets in a decade and that is as strong a signal as I think you can get from our economic policy leaders. I think it would be just a terrible idea. Senator Flake and I have visited and worked with countries in the developing world in Africa where the President can pick up the phone and demand that central bank print more money or change their monetary policy in order to help the President's re-election prospects. Those countries have economies that are very unstable and not as secure and as prosperous as ours. The independence of the Fed is a key lynchpin of American economic security. And I just-- I plead with the President to reconsider what is a very dangerous course in economic policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. All right. Senator Coons, thank you for joining us. We'll be back in one minute with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now is the chair of the House GOP conference in the new Congress, Representative Liz Cheney. That position is the third highest-ranking House Republican. A job her father held some thirty years ago. Great to have you here. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY (R-Wyoming/@RepLizCheney): Great to be here, Margaret. Thank you very much. MARGARET BRENNAN: A quarter of the U.S. government is shut down right now. You heard from the White House, they'll take less than five billion showing some movement. No movement, yet, that we have heard on the Democratic side from the Senate. But the longer this goes on don't Democrats get more and more leverage as they look at taking control of the House in the New Year? REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Well, I think we-- we know, all of us need to stop talking about this from a political perspective. The bottom line is the President's been clear we've got to secure the border. The House voted for a bill that does just that and we need the Democrats in both the House and the Senate to come to the table to get the work done. So I think, you know, that all the calculations about who this helps or hurts politically at the end of the day the American people want to see the border secure and House Republicans stand firmly with the President in doing what's necessary in order to provide the resources for that. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think this gets tougher the longer it goes on? REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: I think we need to-- we need to get the government open. And I think that we need to do it. We shouldn't have to be in a situation where a government shutdown is-- is you know a threat because the Democrats won't provide the resources to secure the border. So we are committed to doing that. We've already done our work on the House side to pass that legislation with Republican votes. And we need to make sure that-- that the Democrats will come to the table. Nobody wants to see this kind of gamesmanship go on. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. His letter cited concern about the President's lack of respect for allies and lack of clarity regarding competitors like China and Russia. He seemed to invoke a lot of principles that traditionally Republicans do embrace. So do you see this as a call to action for the party that he says the President doesn't believe in these things? REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Look, I-- I am deeply, deeply concerned and I oppose strongly the President's decision, apparently, to withdraw troops from Syria. The apparent decision that-- that we're now going to be looking at withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. I think this President has done a lot of very good things in terms of beginning to rebuild our military, getting out of the Iranian nuclear agreement. But these two decisions would be disastrous. They would really, in many ways, hand victories to our enemies to Iran, to ISIS in Syria, the Taliban, al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. It's a very dangerous path to go down and-- and we shouldn't be going down it. We ought to make sure that we keep our troops there in order to prevent the establishment of safe havens from those groups that want to attack us. MARGARET BRENNAN: But foreign policy is an area that the President has some leeway on here. I mean is there anything Congress can do, other than implore the President to reconsider? REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Well, I think that that's very important. I think that, you know, what we need to do is talk about the substance of these policies and nobody is talking about, you know, the kinds of things that Senator Paul mentions. He seems to really be focused on blame America first and-- and unburdened by facts. But if you look at what our troops are doing on the ground in Syria, for example, it's about twenty-two hundred Special Operations forces providing air support, providing some artillery support and that battle-- that fight against ISIS isn't done. You quoted the numbers of-- of ISIS fighters still there. We've seen how quickly ISIS can reconstitute. If we were to withdraw precipitously from Syria, if we were to withdraw from Afghanistan, leave a situation where our enemies could again establish safe havens. There's no question in my mind the President will regret that and will be in a situation where we probably have to go back at far greater cost, both in terms of treasure but also mostly American lives. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would argue that while the President's pulling out troops, that things like air support, things like continuing to fund and support allies who are the ground forces, the Kurds et cetera, should continue? REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Well, the-- the troops that are there in Syria. That is exactly what they're doing. So we should not pull those forces out. We ought to make sure that we continue that mission until ISIS is defeated. This shouldn't be about, you know, it's been this many years, it's been this much time. You don't just declare victory. You have to say, you know, it is the mission accomplished and that may require that we're there for a long time because we have to make sure, you know, that-- that those who are isolationists in our party. Luckily, there are a few of them, Rand Paul is one of them. They seem to argue-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President seems to agree with him and be one. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Well, it's very important that the President reverse this decision in my view because you've got to remember we are there because we were attacked. And we were attacked by al-Qaeda on 9/11. We-- that's why we are in Afghanistan. In Syria, you've got Iran, you've got ISIS. If we are to withdraw from Syria now we're basically handing Syria to the Iranians. We're handing the Iranians the lynchpin in-- in-- in the Shia crescent that they need and that they have said is their objective and their goal. It will be very dangerous for the United States; it will frankly decrease our security and it will be very dangerous for allies like Israel, and-- and I think it's-- it's important for us to look very closely at what's happening there but-- but that we should not be withdrawing our forces. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we referenced on the intro, which is you're an incredibly powerful position in the new Congress, one of the most-- the most influential female Republican on the House side, but when you look overall at the new Congress the number of Republican women is at the lowest level since 1995. Does your party have a problem attracting candidates or is it getting people to vote for them? REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: We need to do better at both things, Margaret. We need to do better at-- at making sure that we're helping and supporting Republican women as candidates. And we also have to do a better job at making sure that our message is getting out there and that we're attracting more Republican women-- more women voters to the party. And I think a large part of that is explaining to people why it is if you look at the policies that are coming in on the Democratic side, for example, they are very, very far left-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --as far left as socialism. And we need to do a better job as Republicans in explaining why we stand for freedom and opportunity for everybody. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there. Thank you very much-- REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Thank you. Great to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: --for joining us. And we will be back in one moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Overnight, a tsunami believed to be triggered by a volcanic eruption hit coastal towns along Indonesia's Sunda Strait. Two hundred and twenty-two people are dead, eight hundred and forty-three are injured and dozens are still missing. The death toll is expected to rise. The massive wave crashed down on a group of people attending a concert on the beach and destroyed homes, cars, and buildings in the area, and it comes just days before the fourteenth anniversary of the 2004 tsunami in western Indonesia that killed more than two hundred and thirty thousand people. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION, and our sixty-eight-year CBS News tradition. The CBS News correspondents' year-end roundtable. Joining me today, national security correspondent David Martin, and chief justice and homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues, plus, chief Washington correspondents Major Garrett and CBS News correspondent Paula Reid, who interrupted her visit to her new in-laws to join us this morning. Thank you very much, Paula, for being here. MAJOR GARRETT (CBS News Chief Washington Correspondent/@MajorCBS): Lot of interruptions this week. PAULA REID: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And a lot of chiefs at the table, too. MAJOR GARRETT: Way too many chiefs. MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and way too many headlines. But, David, I want to start off with you. This Mattis resignation, he, clearly, quit based on that letter where he laid out fundamental differences that he has with the President. What happens next? DAVID MARTIN (CBS News National Security Correspondent/@CBSDavidMartin): Well, we don't know. For one thing, the resignation was not going to take effect until the end of February, so he'll be on the job for effectively two more months through the creation of the new budget, through another meeting of NATO defense chiefs. But we are getting indications this morning that he may be going right now. MAJOR GARRETT: Mm. MARGARET BRENNAN: That he was fired, essentially, told to-- DAVID MARTIN: We have a statement from the Pentagon saying the secretary of defense serves at the pleasure of the President. And I interpret that as-- as meaning that the secretary has been asked to go at once, I don't have confirmation of that. But that's how I interpret that statement. MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean in the immediate sense, who steps up? DAVID MARTIN: Well, the-- the deputy secretary of defense is a man named Patrick Shanahan, most people never hear the name of the deputy secretary of defense. He's got a lifetime of experience with Boeing building airplanes. He likes to say he's built more airplanes than anybody in the world and it's-- it's probably true. He's in charge of President Trump's pet project of creating a space force. So, he's had a number of dealings with-- with President Trump. He's, obviously, not the military expert that Mattis is. But what you really need to run the Pentagon is executive expertise and skills. So, the fact that he's not a military expert does not mean that he can't be an effective acting secretary of defense. MAJOR GARRETT: At the White House the only name that has surfaced with any specificity has been Patrick Shanahan's-- DAVID MARTIN: Right. MAJOR GARRETT: --as a replacement, this was a couple of days ago. And on the Hill, soundings I received is that because he's been confirmed already he might have an easier confirmation process while the administration has so many confirmation battles ahead of it--interior secretary, attorney general, U.N. ambassador, et cetera, et cetera. This might be a person who could take that position, pay attention to procurement, maintenance, space force and leave maybe some of the larger policy questions to Secretary of State Pompeo and the National Security Advisor John Bolton that would certainly please the two of them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Major, if-- if what David is saying he's sort of reading between the lines of that Pentagon statement is true that-- MAJOR GARRETT: Well, that always means the same thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that he's fired. MAJOR GARRETT: I sever the pleasure of the President. The President is displeased. I am out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we clearly saw-- MAJOR GARRETT: That's how-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --from these tweets last night that where the President fairly attacked Mattis-- MAJOR GARRETT: That's what historically has meant. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and Brett McGurk-- MAJOR GARRETT: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that he's very frustrated. What has actually happened? Is it just the media coverage of-- of how this went down or what would have triggered the President to say February twenty-eighth is way too long for Mattis to stay opposed? MAJOR GARRETT: That the criticism is too intense, that it's getting too much attraction. And stepping back for a second, there's been this thought of these stabilizing forces around the President, whether it was John Kelly, Secretary Mattis for a while, Rex Tillerson, et cetera. Perhaps what the country actually need is what it voted for--the actual undiluted approach to national security questions that this President campaigned on, which is what he says in his defense he is now doing. I told you I wanted to get out of Syria. I told you I didn't want to have endless wars. I told you I wanted to come back home. Now, I'm doing it. Forget about the process; forget about the communication strategy, I am doing what I told you. Watch it, look it, evaluate it. Perhaps with the guardrails now less close to this President, the country is going to get what it voted for and what actually is closer to his core instincts. We'll decide if we're comfortable with that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: David, what are your thoughts on what Major just laid out there? Is Shanahan to stay or are we going to see other nominees that perhaps the Pentagon would like to see at the helm? DAVID MARTIN: Well, I-- the-- the other names you hear are the retired Army General Jack Keane and Senator Tom Cotton. Keane is about to turn seventy-six and-- and that's getting up there for a job as demanding as secretary of defense. And both Keane and Cotton are opposed to the Syria pullout. So they don't seem like natural fits. I-- I agree very much with what Major just said, it-- the story all along about President Trump has been that he blows off intelligence briefings, he can't change his mind. But now, what's changed is he is taking decisions based on his instincts not just telling people not to bother him with these arguments. He's making decisions based on his instincts. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we saw similar pattern play out, Jeff, this week with the back and forth over what the President would actually agree to in terms of funding and border security measures, you know. First, Republicans thought they could get something through without border wall funding. Now, that's what we're shutting down the government around. JEFF PEGUES (CBS News Chief Justice & Homeland Security Correspondent/@jeffpeguescbs): Yeah. There was a deal, then there wasn't a deal, there's not a deal now, and it could go on beyond Christmas. And there are some federal employees right now who don't know as they head into Christmas when they will get their next paycheck. But, obviously, this is the President who-- who feels like this may be his last chance to get that border wall. He wants five billion dollars, the Democrats were offering 1.6. But now, they feel emboldened I think and they have lowered their number down to 1.3. So we're at a stalemate now. And the question is when will this be resolved? MARGARET BRENNAN: And when will we see the current secretary of Homeland Security remain at post? Is-- does she have an expiration date on her as many are predicting? JEFF PEGUES: Well, I-- I think we've been waiting for that shoe to drop, especially, after General Kelly was announced that he was going to leave and he is someone who is sort of a mentor for her. So when he left or in word-- MARGARET BRENNAN: It's in the process, right? JEFF PEGUES: Exactly. You know, there were-- those of us who cover Homeland Security wondering, well, could she be next? That's what we're expecting with Kelly on the way out. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Paula, a lot of new blood in the New Year. Potentially, at the moment we have an acting attorney general and some news around him this week as it pertains to what the Justice Department recommended ethics wise. And that was that he recused himself from any kind of dealings with the Russia probe something that the prior AG had been fired for doing in the first place. What do people need to understand about this decision? PAULA REID (CBS News Correspondent/@PaulaReidCBS): Two big headlines coming tout this week about Whitaker and his role in the Russia investigation. The first that we learned, he has never received any briefings about the Mueller probe so far. So that means everything that happens so far with Cohen, anything that's gone on with the special counsel, that has still been approved by Rod Rosenstein, not Acting Attorney General Whitaker. Then we learned that ethics officials said that if Whitaker asked, they would advise that he recuse out of an abundance of caution based on these criticisms of-- of the special counsel that he made before he came to the Justice Department. But Whitaker never asked. And so he has made a decision that he will take over the supervising role of the special counsel investigation going forward. He will begin to receive briefings. He and Rod Rosenstein will jointly oversee the special counsel investigation until an attorney general is confirmed. MARGARET BRENNAN: And do we have any prediction of when that could take place? PAULA REID: No. But we got a preview of what that confirmation battle. As Major noted, one of many will start to look like because we have this memo surface written by Barr. He sent this unsolicited memo to the deputy attorney general, laying out a pretty stark criticism of one of the central veins of the special counsel probe, which is obstruction of justice. Barr argues that the President couldn't possibly obstruct justice. If he was working within he's power he has the right to fire the FBI director, he has the right to dangle pardons. Many legal scholars have made this argument, but Barr sort of took it to an eleven. And now-- now, people are concerned that if he does take over supervision of the special counsel investigation that he may be willing to shut down that aspect of the probe. MARGARET BRENNAN: Last time you were here, which wasn't too long ago, you said I think February or March for the end of the Mueller probe or at least until then. Do you stick by that? PAULA REID: I do, because you have so many things that need to be wrapped up. We've been hearing for months that people say, \"Well, I think it's going to wrap up. I think it's going to wrap up.\" Well, I don't. And there are several reasons for that. One, Mike Flynn's sentencing won't happen any time before March, you also have the grand jury continues to hear additional witnesses. We expect new indictments. You also have the special counsel fighting subpoenas in court. Paul Manafort won't be sentenced until February and then March. The Special Counsel's Office continues to exist until every single discrete case is wrapped up. I don't see that happening before the end of March. JEFF PEGUES: I think it's interesting, a lot of people put a clock on this thing. But when you look at past special counsel investigations, you know, Benghazi that took two years, and some of the others have taken four years, this is nineteen months into the special counsel investigation. The FBI had it first, of course, but nineteen months into Robert Mueller's investigation. (EDITORIAL CORRECTION: There was no special counsel appointed to investigate the attack on U.S. personnel in Benghazi. There was a congressional investigation and a State Department probe, known as the \"ARB.\") MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Major, there's really little part of the Trump empire or Trump White House that's not being probed or investigated at this point. MAJOR GARRETT: Not all by the special counsel. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MAJOR GARRETT: Their scrutiny will be applied by this new incoming House Democratic Majority, for sure. There are other lawsuits about the Emoluments Clause, taking either foreign or domestic revenue at the Trump hotel or Trump properties, is that a violation? Lots of things are being investigated. There is a sense that the White House better person up for this, increase the number of lawyers in the White House counsel's office, that process is ongoing. It's not nearly complete. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they prepared?  MAJOR GARRETT: I don't think you are ever fully prepared. And I would say, if you were to use any statistic or metric that other previous administrations used on the preparation front, they would be far beneath that. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have-- MAJOR GARRETT: One of the things special counsel not affected by the partial government shutdown. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MAJOR GARRETT: Funded fully. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So-- so no backdoor shutdown that way. We have a lot more to talk about, including your predictions for the year ahead, if you're brave enough to make them in this news environment. But we're going to take a quick break. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with our CBS News panel. There is so much we have to digest every week that I feel like all of us always look at ourselves and say, \"Gosh, why didn't I get in that one story or that one point?\" David, for you, what is the most under-reported story that we need to know about?  DAVID MARTIN: To me it's the new National Defense Strategy. Because as Secretary Mattis outlined it, now competition with China and Russia not a war on terror is going to be the primary focus of the-- of the Trump administration and of-- of U.S. National Security. And that means this giant super tanker, that is the United States military, is starting to turn away from whack-a-mole with terrorists toward building up the military to be able to compete on a-- at a high end of conflict. And long after we've stopped arguing about how many troops we should have had in Syria and how long, this is going to continue to play out because it's reflected in-- in the Pentagon budget, which, of course, takes years and years to play out. So this is-- this is a major change in the direction of U.S. foreign policy and-- and national security policy. And I think one that's compatible with the President's Make America Great Again ethos. So I-- I think that's-- we're going to see a big change. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff, for you? JEFF PEGUES: You know with all this talk about pulling out from Syria and Afghanistan, I talked to officials at the FBI who say the number of ISIS-related investigations that they have ongoing is still at about a thousand. You know, that number has been there for about three or four years now so they're still facing these threats from people who are inspired by that ideology. So with all of this talk about pulling the troops out, they are still facing this daily threat of people who are going online and-- and watching what's happening in Syria and Afghanistan and Iraq and are inspired by that ideology still. MARGARET BRENNAN: Still influential. Paula, for you, what has been underreported on your very quiet beat, the Justice Department? PAULA REID: And the one story I love to pay more attention to is the opioid crisis, and the evolution of that crisis we're seeing a record number of deaths, but right now that is being driven more by synthetic opioids called fentanyls. Meanwhile, government policy continues to focus on prescription opioid. So that is something that if I had more time I would certainly be focusing on. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we heard President Trump mention that as a success out of his meeting with Xi Jinping-- MAJOR GARRETT: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that he would change how fentanyl was handled internally in his country. Major, for you, what has been underreported? MAJOR GARRETT: So there is a narrative that exists for a good reason because we feel it every day of this sense of chaos and constant polarized clash in Washington. But on certain issues, and I watched it in the Oval Office for nearly an hour just at the end of this week, there are bipartisan efforts that do succeed and make a big difference. Criminal justice reform. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MAJOR GARRETT: Van Jones standing in the Oval Office, across from Jared Kushner and Ralph Reed all complimenting each other on a coalition that created a significant alteration in American federal criminal justice for the first time in thirty years. The farm bill, does that affect us here on the East Coast to the West Coast? No, but in the center of the country it makes a huge deal. Opioids has at a policy level and at an appropriations level reached a level of critical mass on a bipartisan basis under this President's leadership. Now is the President responsible for that? Largely, no. Why are these successes occurring? Because actual legislators are doing legislative work with the President's approval working out all the hard details, getting the President sign off and making things happen. So, yes, there is a sense of chaos and polarization on macro issues and some of the ones that grab all the headlines. But there is functionality. And it's work in a bipartisan basis and not everything is chaotic and not going anywhere. JEFF PEGUES: But it was interesting how it-- it didn't take long for that message of unity to get trounced upon-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. JEFF PEGUES: --because of the shutdown. You had the criminal justice reform, something that people have been working on for years and it was overshadowed; it disappeared in the news cycle. MAJOR GARRETT: The President is uniquely capable of stomping into submission, his very own good news. MARGARET BRENNAN: I will put in a point of privilege since I am a foreign policy correspondent here. One of the things I think has been underreported is a human rights issue that is what's happening in China. You have reports from the State Department that between eight hundred thousand and two million Muslims have been put in internment camps. Nikki Haley says this is the largest internment of people since World War II. There's been calls for sanctions on Capitol Hill, but we don't hear about it much in the conversations at the presidential level certainly with Xi Jinping. We didn't hear about it. I now want to go into really dangerous territory, which is to try to predict what is coming at us in 2019. David, what should we expect at a Pentagon where we don't yet know who the leadership will be? DAVID MARTIN: Well, just reading the handwriting on the wall, the President has said that the annual military exercises with South Korea are both provocative and-- and too expensive. So I predict that when he meets with Kim Jong-un in January or February, he will offer the concession of suspending the spring exercises-- or not suspending but cancelling the spring exercises with South Korea in return for some sort of concession on North Korea's nuclear weapons program, and that will allow him to continue to maintain despite all of the intelligence to the contrary that the North Korean nuclear threat has been eliminated. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I think it's worth pointing out here on that prediction that your 2016 prediction of Trump and Kim Jong-un meeting came true. So take notes on what David just laid out. DAVID MARTIN: Okay. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you also did say that Baghdadi was going to be taken out. And he seems to still be in at least deep, deep hiding-- DAVID MARTIN: We-- we-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --in Syria. DAVID MARTIN: --we wait to see.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We will wait to see. MAJOR GARRETT: Always take notes of what David Martin says. MARGARET BRENNAN: Always. PAULA REID: Always. MAJOR GARRETT: That's just the bottom line. MARGARET BRENNAN: All of us do. That is absolutely the case. Jeff, what is your prediction? JEFF PEGUES: I am predicting that Mueller will find an element of collusion, conspiracy. Whether it's enough-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JEFF PEGUES: --in this political atmosphere, we'll see. But if you look at the pace of that investigation in the way that he has rolled up cooperating witnesses-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JEFF PEGUES: --I think it's remarkable. If it were any other investigation, I think that type of police work, if you will, would get a lot of attention. We have more than thirty-three indictments and guilty pleas in nineteen months. It's remarkable. I think it's heading towards something that will give the American public a conclusion. MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, Major and Paula. MAJOR GARRETT: I said Saudi Arabia was a huge issue last year in my predictions. I go back to that. Yemen and Syria are vectoring off the Saudi relationship. The death of Jamal Khashoggi and what this administration does or doesn't make of it is going to fundamentally alter our Middle East policy and Pompeo's on it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Paula. PAULA REID: There is no guarantee the Mueller report will be made public. I predict it will set off a massive legal fight to make that full document public. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mid-East peace plan supposed to be coming out by spring. That is what we're hearing. They got fifty pages of it. Stay tuned. We'll be back in a moment with a look at what one member of Congress is doing to try and make for better bipartisan relations on Capitol Hill. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: With all the partisanship in Washington today, we thought we'd leave you with a story about what one Democrat is doing to bring some holiday cheer to his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Fruitcake, it's the holiday season's most despised dessert. But for the last twenty-two years, Oregon Democratic Congressman Earl Blumenauer has been lobbying his fellow lawmakers to join the confection's caucus. EARL BLUMENAUER: We're doing a little drive-by caking. Drive-by caking here. Drive-by fruit caking. MARGARET BRENNAN: That means surprising his colleagues with a treat he's loved since childhood. He makes hundreds every year over his Thanksgiving holiday. EARL BLUMENAUER: It's just kind of a holiday ritual, you know, baking, separating dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of eggs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Over a thousand eggs in fact. Blumenauer makes his deliveries in the offices and halls of the Capitol, each one complete with a shot of Portland area pear brandy. EARL BLUMENAUER: I know you don't drink. JOHN LEWIS: Yeah. EARL BLUMENAUER: But we have brandy for the staff, a fruitcake-- JOHN LEWIS: Okay. Okay. EARL BLUMENAUER: --if it-- if it makes sense. Yes. JOHN LEWIS: That's right. I will pass it on to them. EARL BLUMENAUER: Great. JOHN LEWIS: So could I just taste the sample? EARL BLUMENAUER: You can. Right there. JOHN LEWIS: Very tasty. EARL BLUMENAUER: Here is brandy that some eat with fruitcake, some douse it, some just drink it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The congressman's fruitcake is welcome at any party, even the Grand Old Party. He delivers to his Republican colleagues as well. MAN #1: Hey, hey, hey. This is awesome. Who says fruitcake's no good? It's pretty good. MARGARET BRENNAN: But just Republicans on the Hill. MAN #2: You should run over to the White House with that. EARL BLUMENAUER: No. Want a sample of piece of fruitcake? MAN #3: You know what-- EARL BLUMENAUER: You don't have to. MAN #3: This is-- this will be my only fruitcake of Christmas season. EARL BLUMENAUER: Of a century. MAN #3: That's right. For you, anything. EARL BLUMENAUER: Well-- MAN #3: Any sacrifice. EARL BLUMENAUER: Well, I'm sure it's a sacrifice. MARGARET BRENNAN: But when even a taste is sacrifice, why does he do it? He says it forms a connection with his colleagues that he can't get anywhere else. And he hopes that the spirit of giving something one hates a try might just make its way into the House chamber. MAN #1: One of the best guys you get to work with in Washington, DC. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: The congressman says he pays for it all himself. Well, fruitcake's just one of the traditions. Next week on FACE THE NATION, we'll have another. We'll speak with historians Doris Kearns Goodwin, Michael Beschloss, Jill Lepore and Peter Baker. They'll all be here to talk about their new books and leadership. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. We want to wish you all a merry Christmas and a very happy holiday season. Until next week for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "President Trump stumped for GOP congressman and gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis in Florida Tuesday night in a \"Make America Great Again\" rally that touched on most of the president's favorite topics. DeSantis has been a vocal advocate of Mr. Trump and his policies, as well as a vocal critic of the Justice Department and intelligence agencies. Florida's primary is Aug. 28. When Mr. Trump arrived on stage shortly aft 7 p.m., he was met by fans with \"Make America Great Again\" and \"Make Farmers Great Again\" hats. Supporters also held signs, including one that said, \"Hillary Will Start World War 3.\" In his first two sentences, Mr. Trump mentioned his 2016 victory in Florida. Introducing DeSantis and inviting him on stage, Mr. Trump called him a \"tough, brilliant cookie.\" Mr. Trump also talked up Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for Senate \u2014 or more like, he bashed Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who, in Mr. Trump's words, is controlled by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Scott, who did attend an earlier workforce development event nearby with the president, did not attend the rally. Mr. Trump touched on most of his favorite topics Tuesday night, everything from unemployment figures for African Americans and women, to trade and tariffs. \"Now thanks to our tariffs, our steelworkers are back on the job, American steel mills are back open for business, we are starting to set new records, and nobody believed it could happen this quickly,\" the president said. In one bizarre moment discussing the need for voter ID to prevent voter fraud, the president said anyone who buys groceries needs an ID. That, as anyone who has purchased their own groceries knows, is inaccurate. \"You know if you go out and you want to buy groceries you need a picture on a card. You need ID,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You go out and you want to buy anything, you need ID and you need your picture. In this country, the only time you don't need it in many cases is when you want to vote for a president, when you want to vote for a senator, when you want to vote for a governor or a congressman. It's crazy. It's crazy. But we're turning it around.\" In another inaccurate statement, the president claimed he is the most popular person in the history of the Republican Party. \"They just came out with a poll, did you hear? The most popular person in the history of the Republican Party is Trump. Can you believe this?\" Mr. Trump said. \"So I said, does that include Honest Abe Lincoln? You know he was pretty good, right?\" he added. Mr. Trump tweeted out his support for DeSantis Tuesday morning. \"Will be in Tampa tonight. A big year for\u00a0@RepDeSantis, who will be a great governor for Florida. Strong on Crime, Borders and our 2nd Amendment. Big help on Tax & Regulation Cuts. Loves our Military & our Vets. Has my Full & Total Endorsement!\" the president tweeted Tuesday morning. Will be in Tampa tonight. A big year for @RepDeSantis, who will be a great governor for Florida. Strong on Crime, Borders and our 2nd Amendment. Big help on Tax & Regulation Cuts. Loves our Military & our Vets. Has my Full & Total Endorsement! DeSantis, a conservative member of the House Freedom Caucus, has been one of the president's most ardent supporters, perhaps particularly as the president rails against the DOJ and intelligence community over special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling and any ties to the Trump campaign. Last summer, DeSantis introduced a measure to end the Mueller probe after six months, although that measure didn't go anywhere. This week, DeSantis released an ad in which he tells his young daughter, using children's blocks, to build a wall, reminiscent of Mr. Trump's desire to build a wall along the southern border. Mr. Trump has threatened to shut down the federal government this fall if he doesn't get the funding he wants for his border wall.

            "article_content": "GOYANG, South Korea -- With a single step over a weathered, cracked slab of concrete, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made history Friday by crossing over the world's most heavily armed border to greet South Korean President Moon Jae-in for talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons. Kim then invited Moon to cross briefly back into the north with him before they returned to the southern side.  It was the first time a North Korean leader has crossed over to the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone since the Korean War armistice in 1953. The two Koreas agreed during the historic summit to rid their peninsula of nuclear weapons, but they failed to provide any new specific measures on how to achieve that goal. A joint statement issued after the leaders' talks Friday said the two Koreas had confirmed their goal of achieving \"a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula through complete denuclearization.\"\u00a0 In what both sides referred to as the \"Panmunjom Declaration,\" the Koreas agreed to an end goal of formally ending the Korean War with a peace treaty by the end of this year, and to immediately end all hostilities on the Korean Peninsula, involving trilateral or 4-way talks with the U.S. and China. The entire summit must be seen in the context of the last year -- when the United States, its ally South Korea and the North seemed at times to be on the verge of nuclear war as the North unleashed a torrent of weapons tests - but also in light of the long, destructive history of the rival Koreas, who fought one of the 20th century's bloodiest conflicts and even today occupy a divided peninsula that's still technically in a state of war.  \"I feel like I'm firing a flare at the starting line in the moment of (the two Koreas) writing a new history in North-South relations, peace and prosperity,\" Kim told Moon as they sat at a table, which had been built so that exactly 2018 millimeters separated them, to begin their closed-door talks. Moon responded that there were high expectations that they produce an agreement that will be a \"big gift to the entire Korean nation and every peace-loving person in the world.\"   Beyond the carefully choreographed greeting, however, it's still not clear whether the leaders can make any progress in talks on the nuclear issue, which has bedeviled U.S. and South Korean officials for decades. North Korea's nuclear and missile tests last year likely put it on the threshold of becoming a legitimate nuclear power. North Korea claims it has already risen to that level.  Kim acknowledged the widespread skepticism: \"We have reached big agreements before but were unable to fulfill them ... There are skeptical views on whether the meeting today will yield meaningful results,\" Kim said. \"If we maintain a firm will and proceed forward hand in hand, it will be impossible at least for things to get worse than they are now.\"  The leaders had \"sincere, candid\" talks on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and were working on the wording of a joint statement, according to Moon's spokesman, Yoon Young-chan. They also discussed ways to establish peace on the Korean Peninsula and improve ties.  Kim and Moon in their talks vowed to have more meetings, Yoon said, with Kim joking that he would make sure not to interrupt Moon's sleep anymore, a reference to the North's drumbeat of early morning missile tests last year.  Kim also referred to a South Korean island that North Korea attacked with artillery in 2010, killing four, saying the residents of Yeonpyeong Island who have been living in fear of North Korean artillery have high hopes the summit will help heal past scars.  Kim said he'd visit Seoul's presidential Blue House if invited.  Isaac Stone Fish, CBSN contributor and senior fellow at the Asia Society, put the summit in context.  \"It's certainly incredibly significant to see these two men meeting with expectations of peace being so high,\" Fish said. \"I think a lot of people have talked about the shift of where we are today and where we were several months ago. It's important to remember that even though the two leaders are smiling and posing with children ... it's very possible in a few months from now, tensions will go back to where they were.\"  \"It's hard to know how much credit to give to (President) Trump's sanctions and his 'maximum pressure' policy and how much credit to give to Kim Jong Un -- the North Korean dictator feeling secure at home, feeling that he's consolidated enough power domestically, feeling that he now has enough of a nuclear weapons arsenal that he can negotiate -- if not from a position of strength -- a position that he's comfortable he'll be able to stay in power,\" Fish added.  Earlier, both leaders smiled broadly as Moon grasped Kim's hand and led him along a blindingly red carpet into South Korean territory, where schoolchildren gave Kim flowers and an honor guard stood at attention for inspection, a military band playing traditional Korean folk songs beloved by both Koreas and the South Korean equivalent of \"Hail to the Chief.\"   The greeting of the two leaders was planned to the last detail. Thousands of journalists were kept in a huge conference center well away from the summit, except for a small group of tightly controlled pool reporters at the border. Moon stood near the Koreas' dividing line, moving forward the moment he glimpsed Kim, dressed in dark, Mao-style suit, appearing in front of a building on the northern side. They shook hands with the border line between them. Moon then invited Kim to cross into the South, and, after Kim did so, Moon said, \"You have crossed into the South, but when do I get to go across?\" Kim replied, \"Why don't we go across now?\" and then grasped Moon's hand and led him into the North and then back into the South. They took ceremonial photos facing the North and then facing the South.  Two fifth-grade students from the Daesongdong Elementary School, the only South Korean school within the DMZ, greeted the leaders and gave Kim flowers. Kim and Moon then saluted an honor guard and military band, and Moon introduced Kim to South Korean government officials. Kim returned the favor, introducing Moon to the North Korean officials accompanying him. They then took a photo inside the Peace House, where the summit was to take place, in front of a painting of South Korea's Bukhan Mountain, which towers over the South Korean Blue House presidential mansion. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, was by his side throughout the ceremony, handing him a pen to sign a guestbook, taking the schoolchildren's flowers from his hand and scribbling notes at the start of the talks with Moon.  Nuclear weapons topped the agenda as the two leaders met, and Friday's summit will be the clearest sign yet of whether it's possible to peacefully negotiate those weapons away from a country that has spent decades doggedly building its bombs despite crippling sanctions and near-constant international opprobrium.  Expectations have been generally low, given that past so-called breakthroughs on North Korea's weapons have collapsed amid acrimonious charges of cheating and bad faith. Skeptics of engagement have long said that the North often turns to interminable rounds of diplomacy meant to ease the pain of sanctions - giving it time to perfect its weapons and win aid for unfulfilled nuclear promises.  Advocates of engagement, however, say the only way to get a deal is to do what the Koreas tried Friday: Sit down and see what's possible.  Kim and Moon appeared to be getting on amicably. After their first round of talks, the leaders emerged and jointly planted a pine tree, which stands for peace and prosperity, on the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), which has symbolized confrontation and division over the past 65 years.\u00a0  The pine, a tree beloved by the Korean people, was selected as the species for the commemorative tree planting. The particular tree planted on Friday dates back to 1953, when the Korean War Armistice Agreement was signed. A mixture of soil from mountains in North and South was used in the planting, and Kim watered it with water from the Hangang river, while President Moon poured water from the Daedonggang River, symbolizing cooperation and harmony between the Koreas.  Engraved on the stone plaque which sits in front of the tree is the phrase \"Peace and Prosperity Are Planted,\" as well as the signatures of both leaders.  The commemorative tree-planting event was suggested by the South Korean government and agreed to by the North, which also accepted the South's choice of tree species and wording for the stone plaque placed in front of the tree.  After the tree was planted and watered, the two leaders posed briefly for photos before engaging in a friendly chat as they walked together to a footbridge at the MDL.  The Footbridge got its name from the United Nations Command, when it was built over a marsh in the Panmunjeom area to shorten the route taken by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which frequently came to Panmunjeom after the Armistice Agreement was concluded. Work to widen and extend the bridge was taken as part of preparations for the 2018 Inter-Korean Summit.  After the second and final round of closed-door talks, the leaders emerged again and sat together to sign a joint \"Panmunjom Declaration\" agreeing to work toward the \"complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\" and a formal end to the war. Officially dubbed the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity, Unification of the Korean Peninsula, the agreement calls for both sides: After the signing ceremony both men walked outside together and gave remarks at side-by-side podiums. Moon said new offices would be established in both North and South Korea to facilitate economic cooperation, and a new liaison office in the Northern border city of Kaesong, where both sides would continue to hold meetings on denuclearization. Kaesong, a joint industrial complex that had workers from both sides of the border, was shuttered several years ago as tensions mounted anew. Kim thanked Moon for hosting the summit, calling him \"brother,\" and saying they had both realized \"we cannot be separated. We are one nation.\" Moon has agreed to visit North Korea's capital of Pyongyang this autumn for another round of talks. The White House said in a statement prior to the summit that it was \"hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula. ... (and) looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks.\"  Moon, a liberal whose election last year ended a decade of conservative rule in Seoul, will be looking to make some headway on the North's nuclear program in advance of a planned summit in several weeks between Kim and Mr. Trump.  Kim, the third member of his family to rule his nation with absolute power, is eager, both in this meeting and in the Trump talks, to discuss the nearly 30,000 heavily armed U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and the lack of a formal peace treaty ending the Korea War - two factors, the North says, that make nuclear weapons necessary.  North Korea may also be looking to use the talks with Moon to set up the Trump summit, which it may see as a way to legitimize its declared status as a nuclear power.  One possible outcome Friday, aside from a rise in general goodwill between the countries, could be a proposal for a North Korean freeze of its weapons ahead of later denuclearization.  Seoul and Washington will be pushing for any freeze to be accompanied by rigorous and unfettered outside inspections of the North's nuclear facilities, since past deals have crumbled because of North Korea's unwillingness to open up to snooping foreigners.  South Korea has acknowledged that the most difficult sticking point between the Koreas has been North Korea's level of denuclearization commitment. Kim has reportedly said that he wouldn't need nuclear weapons if his government's security could be guaranteed and external threats were removed.  Whatever the Koreas announce Friday, the spectacle of Kim being feted on South Korean soil was striking.  Kim and Moon enjoyed each other's company in the jointly controlled village of Panmunjom near the spot where a defecting North Korean soldier fled south last year in a hail of bullets fired by his former comrades, and not too far where North Korean soldiers axe-murdered two U.S. soldiers in 1976.

            "article_content": "President Trump's strategy of becoming aggressively involved in the midterm elections is prompting concern among some Republicans who worry he's complicating the political calculus for GOP candidates trying to outrun his popularity. Those Republicans worry their statewide candidates may rise or fall based on Mr. Trump's standing, muddling their path to maintain control of Congress. But Mr. Trump has no plans to step out of the spotlight. He will hold a rally Saturday in Ohio and plans to host two fundraisers at the Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, New Jersey, next week for House and Senate candidates, according to a campaign official with knowledge of the president's events. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details about the fundraisers that haven't yet been publicly released. The president is casting himself as the star of the midterms, eagerly inserting himself into hotly contested primaries, headlining rallies in pivotal swing states and increasing his fundraising efforts for Republicans. Last week, Mr. Trump agreed to donate a portion of his reelection fund to 100 GOP candidates running in competitive House and Senate races. He's expected to be even more aggressive in the fall. White House officials say he's reserving time on his schedule for midterm travel and fundraising likely to surpass that of former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \"This is now about Donald Trump,\" said Al Cardenas, a former Florida Republican chairman. \"It's a high-risk, high-stakes proposition.\" The question facing Republicans is whether turning out those Trump loyalists is enough to win in toss-up congressional districts or if their path to victory depends more on capturing a share of independents and suburban women turned off by Trump's tumultuous first term. It's a dilemma they will confront in 2018 and beyond. \"If we lose the governor's race for the first time in 20 years, all of a sudden President Trump's chances of winning in 2020 diminish with a Democratic governor,\" said Cardenas. \"You can't win a presidential election if you're a Republican without winning Florida.\" Mr. Trump's aides argue no one energizes Republicans like the president, pointing to the throngs of thousands who wait in long lines to attend his rallies \u2014 he's held 17 since taking office. The aides say the White House is taking a two-pronged approach, sending Trump to mobilize the base while other officials, such as his daughter Ivanka, can generate local headlines and help with voters who may not like the president's aggressive style. The goal is to ensure that the occasional voters who turned out for Mr. Trump in 2016 cast ballots in the midterms. But there are some signs that Mr. Trump's unpopularity with the general electorate may hamper more than help individual Republican candidates. While Republicans have won a series of special elections since Mr. Trump took office, they've captured smaller margins than in previous years. Democrats also had two high-profile upsets, nabbing victories in an Alabama Senate race and a Pennsylvania House race. The GOP is worried about a special congressional election Tuesday in a central Ohio district that Trump won by 11 percentage points in 2016. A Monmouth University poll released this past week showed the race tightening, leaving Republican Troy Balderson with just a 1-point edge. The survey found 46 percent of likely voters approved of Trump, while 49 percent disapproved. Hoping to shore up GOP support, Mr. Trump plans to host a rally in the district Saturday. His visit follows a Monday stop by Vice President Mike Pence. The president's team keeps a close eye on data assessing whether Americans believe the country is headed in the right direction under Trump. And they point to Mr. Trump's strength among Republican voters and an upbeat attitude about the nation's economic climate as evidence Republicans will avoid the rough midterm elections that have afflicted previous administrations. But some Republicans warn Mr. Trump's outsized media presence drowns out the messages of congressional candidates, who believe the path to victory lies with a focus on local issues, the Republican tax cuts and the prospect of Nancy Pelosi becoming House speaker again. In Ohio, Balderson and his GOP allies have tried to tie Democrat Danny O'Connor to Pelosi. O'Connor has repeatedly said he would like to see a new generation of leadership in the House. \"Part of the reason why the Nancy Pelosi attacks are so important is that they're a way to motivate the Republicans who might not love Trump,\" said Ohio GOP strategist Terry Casey. Still, Republicans are often forced to fend off questions about Trump-sparked controversies. In recent days, Mr. Trump publicly mused about a government shutdown sometime in the fall \u2014 a possibility that Republican congressional leaders fear would significantly hamper their electoral prospects. In Pennsylvania on Thursday, the president said he was a \"little bit torn\" about whether it would be better to shut down the government before or after the midterm elections to secure funding for his border wall. \"Whether it's before or after, we are getting it or we are closing down government,\" he told thousands of supporters at a rally in Wilkes-Barre. That kind of uncertainty only serves to further embolden Mr. Trump's opposition, say Democrats. \"Clearly he lights the fire when it comes to energized Democrats,\" said Ohio Democratic Party chairman David Pepper. \"He's going to come and give a rambling, over-the-top speech that has nothing to do with this district or Troy Balderson. It may hurt more than it helps.\" The president's decision to intervene in recent GOP primaries is also raising concerns among some state party officials and politicians, who fear he's siding with candidates who could prove weaker in general elections. Mr. Trump has relished doling out endorsements, sometimes blasting out several a day \u2014 even for those who don't need his backing right now. On Thursday, he tweeted support for Rep. Steve Stivers, an Ohio congressman who chairs the campaign committee for the House GOP, urging people to back him in a primary contest next week. Stivers' primary was held in May and he ran unopposed. The tweet was quickly deleted. The president has compiled a winning streak in recent primaries in which he has made an endorsement, helping favored candidates in South Carolina, Alabama and Georgia. His rally this week in Tampa, Florida, represented his most ambitious attempt to nationalize two races crucial to Republicans' midterm hopes. Trump stood onstage with Rep. Ron DeSantis, a 39-year-old three-term congressman, imploring his supporters to back his campaign for governor. DeSantis was little-known to Republican voters until Trump first tweeted support for him in December. Since then, he's made his ties to Trump a centerpiece of his primary race, focused on Fox News appearances and ads. In recent weeks, he's opened up a double-digit lead over state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, a longtime fixture in Florida politics. DeSantis said he was grateful for Mr. Trump's support but added, \"I appreciate more the leadership you're showing for our great country.\" The president also repeatedly praised Gov. Rick Scott, a Trump ally running for Senate, and attacked his opponent, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Trump, who spends winter weekends at his estate in Palm Beach, claimed the only time he sees the senator is \"five months before every election.\" \"After a while, you forget who's the senator,\" Trump said.",

            "article_content": "President Trump opened his first press conference after the midterm elections \u2014 the longest press conference of his presidency \u2014 with talk about bipartisanship, but he quickly turned combative, sparring with reporters. Mr. Trump had laudatory words for Nancy Pelosi, who could once again be speaker of the House, saying they can work together. But he also blasted members of his own party and reporters. The Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives in Tuesday's election, and Mr. Trump began by framing the results as a \"success\" and emphasizing his role in helping the GOP maintain control of and even gain seats in the Senate. \"We saw the candidates I supported achieve tremendous success last night,\" Mr. Trump boasted. \"We picked up a lot,\" he said. The president also talked about Republican candidates like Reps. Barbara Comstock of Virginia and Pete Roskam of Illinois, who eschewed the Trump \"embrace,\" and he suggested this may have been a contributing factor to their losses. \"On the other hand you had some that decided to let's stay away, let's stay away,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They did very poorly. I'm not sure that I should be happy or sad. But I feel just fine about it. Carlos Curbelo. Mike Coffman. Too bad, Mike. Mia Love. I saw Mia Love, she called me all the time to help her with a hostage situation, being held hostage in Venezuela. But Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\u00a0 \"And Barbara Comstock was another one I mean I think she could have won that race, but she didn't want to have any embrace. For that I don't blame her. But she uh, she lost, substantially lost. Peter Roskam didn't want the embrace, Erik Paulsen didn't want the embrace and in New Jersey I think he could have done well but didn't work out too good. Bob Hugin, I feel badly because I think that's something that could have been won, that's a race that could have been won. John Faso. Those are some of the people that you know decided for their own reason not to embrace whether it's me or what we stand for, but what we stand for meant a lot to most people.\"\u00a0 He also said that \"I retired\" Jeff Flake, the Senate Republican from Arizona who has criticized him. His tone was friendlier towards Pelosi, whose comments on bipartisanship he said he appreciated. Mr. Trump also said he thought it was possible that divided government could be productive and produce stronger legislation. \"It really could be a beautiful\" bipartisan relationship, Mr. Trump mused. Though he expressed optimism about working with the new Democratic majority in the House, realistically, divided government is still likely to make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to move his agenda through Congress unless he's willing to compromise. But he did call Pelosi to congratulate her Tuesday night when it was clear the House had flipped, and he even had a conciliatory tweet for her Wednesday morning. \"In all fairness, Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats. If they give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes. She has earned this great honor!\" CBS News' Major Garrett asked whether the president was prepared to shut down the government over the funding of the southern border wall he campaigned on building. \"I speak to Democrats all the time. They agree that a wall is necessary,\" Mr. Trump said. He was noncommittal about whether he would shut down the government over funds for the wall. The funding for the Homeland Security Department, which would oversee the building of the wall, expires Dec. 8. Garrett also asked about the possibility of changes in his Cabinet following the midterms. \"We're looking at different people for different positions,\" adding that he is mostly \"extremely happy\" with his Cabinet, singling out Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for praise. Mr. Trump then became angry with CNN reporter Jim Acosta when he wanted to continue questioning the president about the caravans making their way north through Mexico, and Mr. Trump wanted to end the questioning. \"CNN should be ashamed of itself for you working for them. You should be ashamed of yourself,\" he admonished Acosta. \"The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible.\" He also said, \"When you report fake news, as CNN does a lot, you are an enemy of the people.\" The president told another reporter to \"sit down\" after he had called on another reporter.\u00a0 By the end of the day, the White House had suspended Acosta's White House press pass \"until further notice.\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement saying that the president \"believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration.\" But Sanders added that the White House would \"never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\" The intern had tried to take the microphone from Acosta when Mr. Trump tried to move on to answer another reporter's question. While Acosta attempted to keep the mic away from the intern, it did not appear that he had \"plac[ed] his hands\" on her. That moment can be seen about 1:27 into this video: \"In Jim @Acosta's defense, I've traveled with him in Washington. He's a diligent reporter\" -- @PeterAlexander POTUS: Well I'm not a big fan of yours either, to be honest. pic.twitter.com/BMGVckrzJu CNN tweeted a statement saying that it stands by Acosta and that Mr. Trump's \"ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far.\" The cable news network called the president's actions \"not only dangerous\" but \"disturbingly un-American.\" The president was asked about the special counsel's Russia investigation. He said, \"I could have ended it anytime I wanted. I didn't,\" he said. And he went on to say \"I think it's very bad for my country, I'll tell you. I think it's a shame.\"",

            "article_content": "Could Republicans hold the House in the upcoming midterms? Don't be ridiculous! The odds are awful. History is against them. The polls are all pointing the other way.\u00a0 There's a better chance of an adulterous, loud-mouthed reality TV star being elected president of the United States... Oops. In the bright light of day, Democrats appear to have a lock on taking control of the House of Representatives. But as they drift off to complacency, Donald Trump's victory\u2014a win that virtually nobody saw coming\u2014still haunts Democrats' dreams. According to the data-crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com, the odds that the GOP will hold onto the 218 seats they need for a majority in the House are just 1-in-7. A slim 15 percent.\u00a0 These same polling experts, by the way, gave Donald Trump just a 1-in-4 chance of winning the White House. But when angry Democrats demanded an explanation from FiveThirtyEight's chief guru, Nate Silver, for getting the 2016 race so wrong, he insisted that he hadn't. \"Things with a 1-in-4 chance of happening happen all the time,\" he noted. And he's right. As David Byler, chief elections analyst at the Weekly Standard pointed out to me, a 15 percent probability \"isn't so far off the probability of rolling a one on a six-sided die -- so it's definitely not what you should bet on, but it's far from unthinkable.\"\u00a0 The conventional wisdom is that a Democratic win is all but certain, and it's easy to see why: Democrats are raising money at a record pace and outpacing Republicans by a 2-1 margin; the \"generic ballot\" question continues to show a Democratic lead, and President Trump is underwater in virtually all of the swing states where Republicans are struggling to hold onto House seats. Add in the broader historic trend of the party winning the White House doing poorly in the first midterm two years later, and that's how pollsters get to a 85 percent chance that Nancy Pelosi will be picking out new curtains for the Speaker's office. (Assuming Democrats make her speaker again, but that's another story\u2026) But what about that 1-in-7 chance? What would have to happen for Republicans to roll snake eyes and sneak by with a win?\u00a0 Here are three reasons why the race for control of the House isn't over: \"What we're seeing in our polling the past two weeks is that Democratic enthusiasm hasn't kept pace with Republicans,\" says Brett Loyd, President and CEO of the Polling Company. \"In early September, the Democrats' generic-ballot advantage was around 10 points. Now it's down around 7 percent. Democrats just haven't been winning the news cycles of late.\" Jim Geraghty, who tracks political races for the conservative National Review, acknowledges that about 15 GOP house incumbents are already \"Dead Members Walking,\" but points out that there are a handful of races (CA 39, FL 27, WA 8) where Republicans are proving to be stubbornly strong.\u00a0 And, he says \"remember that if the Democrats pick up 20 seats \u2014 usually a good year \u2014 the result is still a small GOP majority.\"\u00a0 \u00a0Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, a key player for the GOP during the 2008 campaign when Democrats ran the table, told the Washington Post that this time is different. \"They were resigned in '08. I think the mood now is we have a real shot.\" There are multiple reports that interest in the midterm election is at a record high. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds nearly two-thirds of registered voters have a high level of interest in the midterms\u2014the highest ever recorded in the Journal/ABC poll for a midterm. But \"interest\" isn't the same as \"turnout.\" And as CBS News pollster Anthony Salvanto points out, the turnout models giving Democrats a big win in the house rely on whether \"low-propensity voters who tell us they are going to vote Democratic this year follow through and vote.\"\u00a0 They might\u2026but they might not. The GOP, meanwhile, does best among older, white voters who have some of the highest voter turnout percentages.\u00a0 In addition, some of the seats Democrats need to flip are suburban districts where the percentage of these \"low-propensity voters\" \u2014 younger voters, minority voters\u2014aren't as large a segment of the population. \"Remember that in the late-breaking Senate races in 2014, when Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Pat Roberts of Kansas seemed to be in real danger, they ended up winning with solid margins,\" says Michael Barone, co-founder of the Almanac of American Politics. \"That's because voters outside the major metro areas gave them big margins on Election Day.\" And then there's this: While Democrats lead in the generic poll (\"Which party would you rather have controlling Congress\"), the latest CBS News poll actually finds that the GOP is slightly more popular\u2014or perhaps more accurately, \"less unpopular\"\u2014as a party than the Democrats, with a 40 percent favorability vs. the Democrats' 38 percent.\u00a0 It's a slim advantage, but given the media coverage and the assumption of a Republican collapse, still a surprising one.\u00a0 \"The key to the GOP pulling off a surprise win in the House is that President Trump's approval appears to be surging at the right time in our averages,\" says Sean Trende of Real Clear Politics. That average has the president's approval above 44 percent, which is definitely on his historic high end. Meanwhile, the new WSJ/NBC poll has his job approval up to 47 percent.\u00a0 Loyd believes it's because voters are finally starting to focus on the fundamentals, like the economy. \"The right track/wrong track numbers have been improving, the consumer confidence numbers are way up, and 60 percent of adults believe their children will be better off than they are. This is movement in the right direction,\" Loyd said. In fact, in the latest CBS News poll, 70 percent of Americans say the economy is doing well, the highest number since the tech bubble of 1998. President Trump is making a very simple pitch: \"Democrats produce mobs. Republicans produce jobs.\" He's also seizing on the scenes of thousands of migrants marching north from Central American toward the U.S. border. Democrats may completely disagree with Trump's views on these two issues, but there's little doubt they both play to his strengths. And just in time for an election two short weeks away. Republicans holding the House is still a long-shot bet. But their odds may not be quite as long as Nancy Pelosi would like.

            "article_content": "In 2018, CBS News polled thousands of people across the country on topics ranging from President Trump to the midterm elections, Facebook and the #MeToo movement. Here are some of the highlights. A year after Donald Trump was sworn into office, his overall rating remained historically low and highly partisan. The president began 2018 with a 37 percent approval rating \u2013 it would be his lowest of the year. Similar to 2017, his rating didn't fluctuate much. His high for 2018 was 42 percent, occurring shortly after his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The sharply partisan views of Mr. Trump continued in 2018. The president's average approval rating among Republicans was 85 percent this year; among Democrats it was 7 percent. More than seven in 10 of Mr. Trump's supporters said \"being a different kind of president\" is a big reason they back him. \u00a0 Americans began the year feeling upbeat about the nation's economy and that optimism continued throughout the year.  On Valentine's Day, 17 people were killed in a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \u00a0 In its aftermath, 65 percent of Americans said laws covering the sale of guns should be more strict \u2013 the highest number recorded in the CBS News poll for stricter gun sale laws. \u00a0The public divided, however, on the idea of allowing more teachers and school officials to carry guns, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. The Parkland shooting sparked conversations about gun violence. Sixty-five percent of parents said they had talked with their kids about gun violence in schools since the shooting. It also spurred activism among the school's students and young people across the country. By almost two-to-one, more Americans supported (47 percent) than opposed (27 percent) young people taking part in marches and speaking out on guns and safety.  In the rock-n-roll arena, more Americans continued to pick the Beatles (46 percent) over the Rolling Stones (33 percent) as the better rock band.  As Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress, most Americans expressed little or no confidence in Facebook's ability to protect user data from being used improperly or to prevent the spread of disinformation.\u00a0 Six in ten Americans said the government should increase regulations on technology and social media companies to try to prevent user data from being misused.  As the country marked Earth Day, Americans expressed pessimism about the future condition of the environment.\u00a0 Few (14 percent) expected the environment to be better for the next generation, and most (56 percent) think it will get worse.\u00a0  A year into the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, views of it remain politically polarized. Most Republicans and just over half of independents have called it politically motivated, while most Democrats said it is justified. These views held fairly steady through the rest of 2018. The opioid crisis in the U.S. was on the minds of Americans this year. 71 percent said opioid addiction is a very serious problem for the country, and most said the federal government should be doing more to address it. Majorities across political lines and age and income levels called the issue very serious. June saw a historic meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, the first time a North Korean leader met with a sitting president of the United States. \u00a0After the meeting, fewer Americans expressed unease about possible conflict with North Korea than they did before it, and while more felt the two countries moved closer to peace than to war, a majority (56 percent) did not think the summit would lead to North Korea ending its nuclear program. Most Republicans, however, believed that would happen.  The President's overall approval rating ticked up to 42 percent after his meeting with the North Korean leader \u2013 his highest of the year. More than half - 52 percent - approved of this handling of North Korea specifically.  At the U.S. southern border, parents and children trying to enter the U.S. illegally were being separated from one another. A sizeable 72 percent of Americans disapproved of family separation. Although Republicans split: half supported it, half opposed it. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a much anticipated summit in Helsinki, Finland.\u00a0 Mr. Trump was criticized by many for not confronting Putin about Russian interference in the 2016 election. Only a third of Americans (32 percent) approved of the way Donald Trump handled the summit. Although members of his own party felt positive about it. 68 percent of Republicans approved. \u00a0 The percentage who saw President Trump as too friendly toward Russia jumped 11 points after the meeting. And 39 percent of Americans reported feeling less confident about President Trump standing up for U.S. interests. \u00a0 CBS News and Refinery29 teamed up for a survey of American women with a focus on millennials Women ages 18-35 held the most negative views of Donald Trump's presidency of any age group of women, and most (53 percent) believed his policies have had an adverse effect on women. \u00a0 The survey examined other issues like the #MeToo movement. Younger women were more optimistic than older women that the #MeToo movement and the attention on sexual misconduct will make things better for women in the long term.  One year after a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, most Americans (61 percent) felt racial tensions in the U.S. had grown over the past year. Majorities of whites (56 percent) and blacks (78 percent) held this view, but blacks were especially likely to.\u00a0  As more allegations of child sexual abuse by Catholic priests surfaced, most U.S. Catholics said the Pope and the Vatican were doing a poor job handling these reports, and about a quarter of Catholics said the reports made them question whether they should remain in the Church. Favorable views of Pope Francis dropped sharply in the wake of the scandal from 63 percent in 2016 to 48 percent in 2018.  Six weeks ahead of the midterm elections, voters in both parties in key battleground district were enthusiastic about voting. And it was becoming a nationalized election: more than eight in 10 Democratic and Republican voters said their vote was about helping their party win (or keep) control Congress. Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and the hearings surrounding it captured the public's attention. Americans divided (largely along party lines) on whether or not Kavanaugh should be confirmed. Amid allegations of sexual assault made against Kavanaugh, those who wanted him confirmed said he had the right personal qualities and character for the job, while those opposed to his confirmation did not think he possessed those traits. \u00a0 41 percent of men supported Kavanaugh's confirmation, compared to just 29 percent of women, but partisanship was more closely connected to opinions than gender. Republican women favored Kavanaugh's nomination; Democratic women opposed it. Heading into the midterm elections, Americans were feeling the most positive about the state of the nation's economy since 1998. Although a majority said the country was off on the wrong track pointing to the state of politics, not the economy, as the main reason why. \u00a0 According to the CBS News Battleground Tracker, the Democrats' position in the contest for the House of Representatives was growing stronger. Democrats were helped by a widening gender gap in the race for the House in key districts: Men were backing Republican candidates by 7 percentage points, while women were supporting Democrats by 12 points.  President Trump was on the minds of voters who went to the polls in the 2018 midterms. Sixty-four percent of voters said Mr. Trump was a factor in their vote \u2013 a record high in a midterm\u2013 with more expressing opposition than support for him. Strong backing from women, non-whites, first time midterm voters, and the issue of health care helped propel Democrats to a victory, winning control of the House of Representatives.  Seventy-eight percent of midterm voters said it was important that more women be elected to public office, and a record number of women were elected to the 116th Congress  Looking ahead, three in four Americans (including most Democrats) prefer the Democratic party work with President Trump where both sides agree, but few (29 percent) think they will actually be able to do that.  President Trump has continued to press Congress for funding for a border wall. Most Americans (59 percent) have opposed a wall, although a majority of Republicans (79 percent) have favored one. As 2018 comes to a close, many are thinking about 2019. Forty percent of Americans plan to make resolutions for 2019 with younger people more likely to do so than older people.  The new year will bring a new Congress and new issues, along with the start of the 2020 presidential election campaign. What will develop in the Russia investigation? Will economic optimism remain? \u00a0CBS News will continue to poll the American public to gauge their opinions on key issues and political figures that matter. Stay tuned.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Jeff Glor, President Trump said he believes U.S. intelligence agencies' assessment Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The president's comments came after he was widely criticized for his press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, in which Mr. Trump appeared to say he had no reason to believe Russia interfered with the election. The next day, the president said he misspoke. The first portion of the interview with Mr. Trump aired Wednesday on the \"CBS Evening News.\" The second half of the interview will air Thursday on \"CBS This Morning\" at 7 a.m. ET. GLOR: You say you agree with U.S. intelligence that Russia meddled in the election in 2016. TRUMP: Yeah and I've said that before, Jeff. I have said that numerous times before, and I would say that is true, yeah. GLOR: \u00a0But you haven't condemned Putin, specifically. Do you hold him personally responsible? TRUMP: Well I would, because he's in charge of the country. Just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country. So certainly as the leader of a country you would have to hold him responsible, yes. GLOR: What did you say to him? TRUMP: Very strong on the fact that we can't have meddling, we can't have any of that, now look. We're also living in a grown up world. Will a strong statement, you know, President Obama supposedly made a strong statement, nobody heard it, what they did hear is the statement he made to Putin's very close friend. And that statement was not acceptable. Didn't get very much play relatively speaking. But that statement was not acceptable. But I let him know we can't have this, we're not going to have it, and that's the way it's going to be. GLOR: But he denies it, so if you believe US intelligence agencies, is Putin lying to you? TRUMP: I don't want to get into whether or not he's lying. I can only say that I do have confidence in our intelligence agencies as currently constituted. I think that Dan Coats is excellent, I think that Gina is excellent. I think we have excellent people in the agencies. And when they tell me something it means a lot. GLOR: Coats says the threat is ongoing. Do you agree with that? TRUMP: Well, I'd accept, I mean he's an expert. This is what he does. He's been doing a very good job. I have tremendous faith in Dan Coats. And if he says that, I would accept that. I will tell you, though, it better not be. It better not be. GLOR: Have you talked to Coats since you got back? TRUMP: Yeah, I have, sure. GLOR: What'd he say? TRUMP: Well, just talked, generally speaking. Yeah, he, he agrees with the statement you made. And I go along with him. He's a very, he's a great guy. He's a great patriot. He loves his country. And he's only going to say what he truly believes. And the information that's given to him is that. GLOR: Do you think any intelligence agencies, U.S. intelligence agencies, are out to get you? TRUMP: Well, certainly in the past, it's been terrible. You look at Brennan, you look at Clapper, you look at Hayden, you look at Comey, you look at McCabe, you look at Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page. You look at other people in the F.B.I. that have been fired, are no longer there. TRUMP: Certainly I can't have any confidence in the past. But I can have a lot of confidence in the present and the future, because it's getting to be now where we're putting our people in. But in the past, no, I have no confidence in a guy like Brennan. I think he's a total low-life. I have no confidence in Clapper. You know, Clapper wrote me a beautiful letter when I first went to office, and it was really nice. TRUMP: And then, all of a sudden, he's gone haywire because they got to him and they probably got him to say things that maybe he doesn't even mean. But no, I certainly don't have confidence in past people. You look at what's happened. Take a look at all of the shenanigans that have gone on. Very hard to have confidence in that group. GLOR: On Saturday you told us your doctrine is strength. TRUMP: Strength. GLOR: And achieving peace through strength. TRUMP: Right. GLOR: After Helsinki, Lindsey Graham said you showed weakness. (OVERTALK) TRUMP: Well, Lindsay, you know, you're gonna have to-- let-- lemme just--\u00a0 GLOR:\u00a0 Newt Gingrich said it was the most serious mistake in your presidency. TRUMP:\u00a0I totally disagree. I think I did great at the news conference. I think it was a strong news conference. You have people that said, 'You shoulda gone up to him. You shoulda walked up and started screaming in his face.' We're living in the real world. OK? GLOR: Who gives you the best advice? When you come back and you read all these stories, you said, you know, what the fuss is all about. Who, who do you talk to? TRUMP: Well, I-- I will tell you, I don't know what the fuss is all about. I think we did extremely well. And I think the press makes up the, look, it's fake news. And people understand. I think the press largely makes up a lot of the fuss about a lot of things. And I'm not talking about everything. TRUMP: It's crazy. You do something that's positive, and they try and make it as negative as possible. Not all. And I have to say this, some of the most honorable people I know, some great people, are reporters, journalists, et cetera. But the level of dishonesty in your profession is extremely high. GLOR: But they-- we-- they-- the-- the press covered the substance and the wording of that press conference accurately. TRUMP: I don't care what they covered. They don't, they didn't cover my meeting. The important thing, frankly, was the meeting that lasted for two and a half hours, or almost two and a half hours. And in that meeting, we discussed many, many things that were very, very positive for both countries. GLOR: What tangibly emerged from that conversation? What, what do you feel you achieved? TRUMP: I think we achieved a lot. TRUMP: Things emerged out that were very important. Nuclear proliferation between Russia and the United States, that's 90 percent of the nuclear weapons. Protection of Israel. He feels good about that, I feel good about that, very good about that. That was a big factor. We talked about North Korea. He said he will help. He agrees with what I'm doing. He thinks I'm doing a great job with respect to North Korea. He said he would help. I think he will. Let's see what happens. GLOR: How? How-- TRUMP: You know, they have a lot of border. They have 25 miles of border right on North Korea. So having that assurance, I think means quite a bit. There were many other things we talked about. But I thought it was a very good. It was about two and a half hours. And I thought it was a very good meeting, very good. GLOR: How do you think he can help specifically on North Korea? TRUMP: Well for one thing, at the border. We don't want anything going in. We hope we have a deal. I think we have a deal. There's no rush, to be honest with you. There are no missiles going off. We have our hostages back. No testing. There's no nuclear testing. So we've come a long way in a short period of time. TRUMP: So there is no rush. But what there is something we would like to see that the denuclearization of North Korea, he feels strongly about it, I feel strongly about it. And that's good. I was not sure how he was going to react to that, but we had a very good discussion, and a long discussion on that. GLOR: I do want to ask you, sir. You said you'll sit with the special counsel before. Has anything changed in the past six months to change your mind? TRUMP: No, my lawyers are working on -- GLOR: More or less likely to? TRUMP: There's no collusion. I didn't deal with Russia. I had nothing to do with Russia with respect to my race. I won that race rather easily. And I can tell you that I think, frankly, 2020, I think it's going to be even better than we did in '16. GLOR: But would you, are you more likely to sit an interview now? TRUMP: My lawyers are working on that. I've always wanted to do an interview, because look, there's been no collusion. There's been no talk of Russia. There's been no phone call. There's been nothing. And it's I call it a witch hunt. That's exactly what it is. It's a it's a vicious witch hunt. And you know what? It's very bad for our country. Very, very bad for our country.",

            "article_content": "During the latest congressional hearing into actions by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was forced to defend himself against harsh criticism from lawmakers that the DOJ has been lax in their ability to turn over sensitive documents related to a variety of investigations.\u00a0 While much of the questioning revolved around the DOJ's inspector general's report which criticized the leadership and judgement of both departments during their handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, both FBI Director Christopher Wray and Rosenstein were pressed on the DOJ and FBI's willingness to hand over documents to congressional investigators as part of their probes into circumstances surrounding the 2016 election. Wray and Rosenstein argued that their departments are dealing with massive volumes of oversight requests.\u00a0 \"As a result of President Trump's commitment to transparency, the FBI is making unprecedented disclosures to the Congress, including granting access to hundreds of thousands of pages of investigative information, and thousands of pages of classified documents,\" said Rosenstein. Wray meanwhile, argued that the FBI was working to make witnesses available, answer questions and provide an additional 880,000 pages of documents to lawmakers.\u00a0 But in a particularly heated exchange with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Jordan accused Rosenstein of having personally redacted items relating to ongoing investigations as well as claims that Rosenstein was not complying with Congressional requests, saying, \"you have seven days to get your act together.\"\u00a0 Jordan was referring to a resolution on the House floor threatening to hold Rosenstein in contempt. The measure ultimately passed following their back-and-forth in a 226 to 183 vote -- demanding that the Justice Department fully comply with all document requests from the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees by July 6.\u00a0 \"Mr. Jordan, I am the deputy Attorney General of the United States, okay? I'm not the person doing the redacting. I'm responsible for who's responding to your concerns as I have. I have a team with me, sir. It's just a fraction of the team that's doing this work, and, whenever you brought issues to my attention, I have taken appropriate steps to remedy them. So, your statement that I am personally keeping information from you, conceal information,\" Rosenstein said.\u00a0 \"You're the boss, Mr. Rosenstein,\" Jordan retorted. \"That's correct, and my job is to make sure we respond to your concerns. We have, sir,\" Rosenstein responded.\u00a0 Rosenstein added, \"When you find some problem with production or with questions, it doesn't mean that I'm personally trying to conceal something from you. It means we're running an organization that's trying to follow the rules.\" Highlights of Thursday's hearing Chairman Bob Goodlatte began his opening remarks at the hearing saying the DOJ IG report revealed \"bias in top echelons in the FBI during a hotly contested president election and revealed agents, lawyers and analysts held profound bias against Donald Trump and in favor of Hillary Clinton.\"\u00a0 His comments come as Strzok participated in an over 11 hour-long interview before a closed meeting of the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform Committees on Wednesday. Text messages exchanged between Strzok and fellow FBI official Lisa Page showed contempt for Mr. Trump throughout the Clinton email probe. The two were also assigned to work on the special counsel's probe into Russian interference in the\u00a02016 campaign, but were removed when the texts were discovered.\u00a0 Peter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. But remember, he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who. Mueller/Comey best friends! President Trump tweeted Thursday morning that Strzok had initiated and worked as the \"leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time\" claiming that he was \"fired because the gig was up.\" While Page has since left the FBI, Strzok is still employed at the FBI while the disciplinary process plays out. Goodlatte urged the DOJ and FBI to \"hold people accountable\" as a result of the report's finding and prevent similar events from ever happening again.\u00a0 Rosenstein: \"This is not a happy occasion\" Rosenstein in his opening remarks, said there's \"nobody who would be more committed to rooting out abuse and misconduct when theres credibly evidence that occurred\" than himself, calling the hearing \"not a happy occasion\" for him. \"The Department of Justice is not perfect. We will keep working to make it better, and we welcome your constructive assistance,\" said the deputy attorney general. Rosenstein said in 2016, many at the DOJ \"deviated from important principles\" and that \"everyone knew about some of those departures when they occurred such as discussing criminal investigations and encroaching on prosecutorial decisions. We learned about others through an internal investigation \u2013 such as leaking to the news media and exhibiting political bias.\" \"We ned to correct errors, hold wrongdoers accountable and deter future violations,\" added Rosenstein. Wray meanwhile, repeated much of his previous testimony from his appearance before the Senate's panel. He noted in his remarks that \"Although the report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper consideration actually impacting the investigation under review, the report did identify errors of judgment, violations of or disregard for policy, and decisions that, at the very least, in hindsight, were not the best choices.\" Jordan v. Rosenstein\u00a0 In a particularly heated exchange with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Jordan accused Rosenstein of having personally redacted items relating to ongoing investigations as well as claims that Rosenstein was not complying with Congressional requests, saying, \"you have seven days to get your act together.\" Jordan was referring to a resolution on the House floor threatening to hold Rosenstein in contempt. The measure passed following their back-and-forth in a 226 to 183 vote, demanding that the Justice Department fully comply with all document requests from the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees by July 6.\u00a0 \"I've heard you make those kind of allegations publicly on TV. Mr. Jordan, I am the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, ok? I'm not the person doing the redacting, I'm responsible for responding to your concerns, as I have...whenever you brought issues to my attention I have taken appropriate steps to remedy them,\" said Rosenstein.\u00a0 He added, \"When you find some problem with production or with questions, it doesn't mean that I'm personally trying to conceal something from you. It means we're running an organization that's trying to follow the rules.\" Rosenstein pushed back further, saying, \"I appreciate your concerns, but your use of this to attack me personally is deeply wrong.\" Jordan continued to press Rosenstein, saying that media reports claim that the deputy attorney general had threatened staffers on the House Intelligence Committee by threatening to subpoena phone calls and emails. \"No sir, and there's no way to subpoena phone calls,\" Rosenstein replied. Jordan then grilled Rosenstein about the testimony Wednesday of Strzok, on what questions he did and didn't answer, under advisement of FBI counsel. The Ohio congressman complained that Strzok couldn't answer the question of whether he'd ever communicated with Glenn Simpson, head of Fusion GPS \"I appreciate your saying it's not personal. Sometimes it feels that way. How do I know, sir? You interviewed Mr. Strzok, I didn't.\" Jordan: \"He works for you. Doesn't work for us.\"\u00a0 \"There are 115,000 people who work for me, sir,\" Rosenstein retorted. \"You should believe me because I'm telling the truth and I'm under oath.\" \"We are not in contempt of this Congress and we are not going to be in contempt of this Congress,\" Rosenstein later urged.\u00a0 Rosenstein testifed that at the DOJ,\u00a0 mandatory annual training will include lessons from the IG report and they are also considering other recommendations to put in place.\u00a0 \"We already revised the confidential policies to emphasize non-public sensitive information is protected from disclosure. We intend to enforce that principle on our employees and demonstrate that respect ourselves,\" he added.\u00a0 Both Wray and Rosenstein addressed ongoing criticism from lawmakers that their departments are not following-through with numerous document requests related to a variety of investigations. Wray and Rosenstein argued that their departments are dealing with massive volumes of oversight requests.\u00a0 \"The FBI is managing an extraordinary volume of congressional oversight requests, some of which seek details about criminal investigations and intelligence sources. As a result of President Trump's commitment to transparency, the FBI is making unprecedented disclosures to the Congress, including granting access to hundreds of thousands of pages of investigative information, and thousands of pages of classified documents,\" said Rosenstein. Wray meanwhile, argued that the FBI working to make witnesses available, answer questions and provide an additional 880,000 pages of documents to lawmakers.\u00a0 \"Although we've now substantially complied with the majority of subpoenas,\" Wray said his department is \"determined to get through outstanding items.\" The FBI has increased staffing devoted purely to submitting to those document requests, saying that 100 employees are working \"day and night, through the weekend to collect, review and process thousands of additional pages.\" Ranking Member Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-New York, slammed Goodlatte for calling an emergency hearing for the IG report's findings, and not on more pressing issues for the committee to provide oversight on, like the administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy at the U.S. border. \u00a0 \"Have we conducted any oversight at all on election security? The administration's failure to protect DREAMERs?\" Nadler asked in his remarks. \"On all other issues the committee stays silent -- on Hillary Clinton's emails, sound the alarms,\" he added.\u00a0 Nadler said that the committee is wasting \"precious time\" to \"chase Hillary Clinton yet again.\" Pressed by Rep. Ron Desantis, R-Florida, if the deputy attorney general should be recused form the Mueller probe, Rosenstein said, \"I can assure you, were it appropriate \u00a0for me to recuse myself, I'd be more than happy do so, but it's my responsibility to do it.\" Much to Mr. Trump's frustration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation. Despite the president's clear disapproval with the move in repeated public attacks, \u00a0Sessions has said he believes\u00a0he made the right decision\u00a0in recusing himself.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "The 2018 Congressional midterms are shaping up to be a coast-to-coast battle for the House and there are enough districts potentially in play across the country that majority control looks like it's up for grabs.  When we look at the specific districts that could matter in 2018, we see a large set of Republican-held seats in suburban and exurban areas \u2013 setting up a challenge for Democrats to try to win over places that haven't typically favored their House candidates, regardless of other votes or issues. As they make their bid to retake the majority, the Democrats will also need to reverse historical turnout trends and get Democratic-leaning voters engaged this time, after they've typically stayed home in midterms \u2013 and scale-up the turnout boosts they've seen of late in local and special elections and around the country. The Republicans, for their part, have a voting base that historically does show up in midterms, and one which remains staunchly committed to the party and the president.\u00a0 They will have to see, however, whether the president's low approval ratings beyond the base weigh down their candidates. \u00a0 The biggest factor in 2018 might be the sizable cushion the Republicans have to work with in protecting their 24-seat majority \u2013 since the last redistricting in 2011 and 2012, neither party has managed to net more than 13 in any cycle. The flip side of that, though, is that the GOP has to defend many more of the competitive seats than the Democrats do. Larger gains beyond 24 seats have lately come in what we think of as \"wave\" years, when one party does consistently and unusually well across a wide range of places, such as when the Democrats netted 31 seats to re-take the House in 2006, and when Republicans made historically huge pickups in 2010, netting 63. So the measure we'll watch as 2018 moves along might simply be that one: does it look like a wave, or not? In this inaugural edition of the CBS News House model, we identify 45 seats that are likely or probably going to be competitive, based heavily on district characteristics and their historical vote patterns; not all the candidates are set yet, so this will change as the year unfolds. Republicans currently hold 35 of these 45 seats. (Depending on what happens with the districts in Pennsylvania, which are likely to be redrawn, more would become competitive.) There will be competitive races in nearly every corner of the country, so 2018 won't see us just traversing the usual presidential election \"battleground\" states. We'll be tracking many districts on the coasts: in California, a few in New Jersey and New York and Florida. There may also be hot races in Minnesota and Iowa, and back in the southwest, in Nevada and Arizona too. (There are another 30+ districts we're putting on the watch list. They profile as potentially competitive, but we'll have to wait for polling and candidates to know more.) Watch the districts that have relatively more voters with college degrees and higher incomes or home values \u2013 they're the sort of voters that national polls suggest may be less enthusiastic about the administration this year, but who haven't wholesale embraced the Democrats either. One wild card policy in these districts might be the tax cuts: do they find favor among the upper-income voters who'll reward the Republicans, do they raise concerns about the deficit, or \u2013 in places like California, New Jersey and New York \u2013 do voters with higher home values and state taxes feel like the new rules punish them too much? Here are some examples: the suburbs of Atlanta (GA 6); sprawling central New Jersey (NJ 7) and the wealthier suburbs of Garden-state commuters closer to New York City (NJ 11); Virginia's booming exurbs beyond Washington, DC (VA 10); and perhaps the suburbs outside Minneapolis-St. Paul. If there is close race for House control in November, things could all be decided out West, in southern California in particular, where congressional districts aren't quite as lopsided as in many other states to begin with. Here we see a number of themes mix, from the voting patterns of both coastal suburbanites and the working class, as well as the Hispanic vote, which comprises a large segment in many areas. Examples: the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles (CA 25); the rapidly changing parts of Orange County (CA 39); wealthier communities stretching from southern Orange County to San Diego (CA 49); 400 miles east across Interstate 8, Arizona enters this mix too, in the closely-split areas around Tucson (AZ 2). White, non-college voters have been one of the foundations of the president's support and, increasingly, Republican congressional support as well. This will be tested in the special election coming up in PA 18, a predominantly white area outside Pittsburgh. Then in November, a few districts profile as potential tests for whether Democrats can recapture some of this group too. Here we may see battles in traditionally Republican, rural, and small-town areas of otherwise blue states. Depending on what comes of the new Pennsylvania redistricting, a proposed new map would bring in districts that would address this theme as well, along with more battles in affluent suburbs outside Philadelphia. Examples: upstate New York, where the economy has been slow to rebound (NY 19 and NY 22); eastern Iowa where Democrats have often done better than they did in 2016 (IA 1); and districts with a mix of fast-growth pockets and rural areas, where the Democrats need to defend seats, in order to look for pickups elsewhere (MN 1 and MN 08). There are multiple majority-Hispanic districts: this group tends to back Democrats nationally and views President Trump and the Republicans quite unfavorably. Democrats are hoping to harness their dissatisfaction this November. Their challenge is that Latino turnout tends to drop in midterm election years. Additionally, Hispanic voters living in competitive districts, such as the heavily Cuban parts of Florida, are more inclined to vote for Republicans than Hispanics are nationally. Whether Democrats can change that pattern will be on display from Florida to Texas and California, among others places. Examples: the heavily rural Central Valley (CA 21); heavily Hispanic South Florida (FL 26), including high-income parts of Miami (FL 27); and the largest district in Texas, which spans more than 800 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border (TX 23). And a note on classifying districts by their past presidential vote: You'll probably see plenty of shorthand descriptions in 2018 about the places where Hillary Clinton got more votes than Donald Trump \u2013 but we include other factors in our model because almost by definition, that presidential vote is an incomplete measure for the midterms. 1) Those are places clearly willing to elect a Republican to Congress even if they side with Democrats on other matters. 2) There aren't enough Republicans representing districts like that for the Democrats to take the House based on beating only them and 3) those results are based on presidential year turnout, a feat Democrats would need to replicate in a midterm, so that describes a challenge as much as an opportunity for them. Republican-held districts: AZ 2 (Open) CA 10 CA 25 CA 39 (Open) CA 48 CA 49 (Open) CO 6 FL 26 FL 27 (Open) IA 1 MI 11 (Open) MN 2 NE 2 NJ 2 (Open) NJ 11 (Open) NY 22 PA 1* PA 5* (Open) PA 6* PA 7* (Open) TX 23 VA 10 WA 8 (Open) Democratic-held districts: MN 1 (Open) MN 8 (Open) NH 1 (Open) Republican-held districts: CA 45 FL 18 GA 6 IA 3 IL 6 KS 2 (Open) KS 3 KY 6 ME 2 MI 8 MN 3 NJ 7 NY 11 NY 19 PA 17* TX 7 UT 4 (Open) Democratic-held districts: AZ 1 CA 7 FL 7 NJ 5 NH 2 NV 3 (Open) NV 4 (Open)",

            "article_content": "The National Rifle Association pounced when former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat running for the U.S. Senate, declared at an AFL-CIO event in Cleveland that the death of conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia \"happened at a good time.\" Scalia remains a hero to many gun owners and the NRA alerted its members to Strickland's disrespect. It was part of a barrage by the group to portray its one-time ally as an anti-gun politician interested only in money and power. \"That was painful,\" said Strickland, recalling the NRA's effort to tear down the public trust he'd spent years building. \"They were out to get me.\" The anti-Strickland campaign in the battleground state of Ohio two years ago is a window into how the influential gun rights group wields its political muscle. That clout will be on display heading into the 2018 midterm elections as gun control advocates demand swift action following the Feb. 14 shooting at a high school in Florida. The NRA's deep pockets and bare-knuckled approach leave the impression it effectively purchases loyalty from lawmakers. But the NRA actually donates small amounts of money to candidates when compared to the large sums it spends on potent get-out-the-vote operations and ad campaigns. NRA-funded advertisements that air on cable networks and travel across the internet during the months and weeks before an election are carefully crafted to warn members of candidates that, if elected, will come for their guns. The NRA's political action committee, the Political Victory Fund, also grades elected officials on an A to F scale, a shorthand voting guide that steers members to pro-gun candidates. The Political Victory Fund and the NRA's lobbying arm spent about $52.5 million overall during the 2016 elections on \"independent expenditures,\" according to political money website OpenSecrets.org. There's no limit on this type of campaign spending and it includes money for television and online advertising, mailers and other forms of communication designed to support or oppose a particular candidate. Nearly 70 percent of the NRA's 2016 budget was used to target Democrats, with Hillary Clinton topping the list of candidates the group sought to defeat. The rest went to backing Donald Trump and congressional Republicans who've consistently shot down attempts by Democrats to approve gun control measures in the wake of mass shootings in the United States. But pressure for at least modest firearms restrictions is heavy after 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which in turn raises the stakes for the NRA. Trump stunned his GOP allies last week when he sided with Democrats by urging quick and substantial changes to the nation's gun laws. Yet later, after meeting with Trump, NRA leaders declared the president and his administration \"don't want gun control.\" The mixed messages brought action on gun legislation in Congress to a halt. The figures compiled by Open Secrets show that in Ohio the NRA spent nearly $1.6 million to oppose Strickland in the 2016 Senate race, while devoting about half as much to support the Republican incumbent, Sen. Rob Portman, who defeated Strickland by a wide margin. The NRA donated $9,900 directly to Portman's campaign, the same amount the group gave to 12 other Republican lawmakers. Unlike independent expenditures, donations from individuals and PACs are capped for each election cycle. Portman said the NRA's money represented just a fraction of the more than $25 million his campaign raised in 2016 and he denied the gun group acquired any leverage through the donations. \"I never make a decision based on a contribution,\" Portman said. \"That's just not how you operate.\" The NRA's Political Victory Fund ran its first ad against Strickland in July when the Ohio Senate race was still competitive, and the 30-second spot illustrates the gun group's tactics. Strickland is portrayed as a traitor for turning his back on gun rights. \"Ted Strickland. Out for power. Out for money. Out . . . for himself,\" the narrator said as suspenseful music plays in the background. Strickland said the NRA succeeded in shifting the impression many Ohioans had of him. Suddenly it didn't matter as much that he was a steelworker's son who'd grown up on a dirt road in the state's Appalachia region. Or that he was raised among guns and just a few years before the Senate race had earned the NRA's coveted A+ rating. All that mattered to the NRA was that Strickland, troubled by a spate of mass shootings, had changed his mind. After stepping down as governor, he joined a liberal advocacy group and backed comprehensive background checks for gun buyers and a ban on assault-style rifles. David Niven, a professor of American politics at the University of Cincinnati, said the NRA almost certainly wanted to punish Strickland for being an \"apostate\" on top of ensuring the gun-friendly GOP maintained its majority in the Senate. Political action committees and other outside groups tend to sweep in during the last stages of an election, but Niven said the NRA got an early start in Ohio. \"I don't think there's any question that they intended their participation in this race to send a message,\" Niven said. \"There was something intolerable to them about having an ally turn into a skeptic.\" Strickland served in Congress for more than a decade until 2006, when he successfully ran for governor with the NRA's backing. He got the group's support a second time when he ran for re-election in 2010, but lost to Republican John Kasich as the governor's race centered on economic woes gripping the state. The NRA's endorsement commended Strickland as \"an unwavering defender of our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms\" and noted his opposition to a 2004 ban on certain semi-automatic weapons while in Congress and his signature on an update of concealed carry laws. But that opinion changed drastically after Strickland in 2014 became president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action, which the NRA called a \"radical anti-gun group\" for proposing gun control measures. When Strickland sought to unseat Portman two years later, the NRA \"reframed the race in ways that were detrimental to me,\" he said. Trump won Ohio by about 447,000 votes. Scioto, Strickland's home county on the border with Kentucky, backed Trump and Portman overwhelmingly. The NRA's opposition had an effect, Strickland said, but he didn't believe it was the deciding factor in his loss to Portman. Portman raised $25 million, more than twice as much as Strickland did, and won over labor unions that had once been firmly in Strickland's corner. As Strickland failed to gain traction with voters, national Democrats pulled millions of dollars in planned pro-Strickland ads out of the state more than a month before the election. The NRA wasn't the only one funneling money into Ohio. Outside groups, including those tied to the billionaire Koch brothers, spent upward of $30 million on anti-Strickland ads focused on Ohio's economy during his governorship, which coincided with the national recession. The NRA struck out in Nevada and New Hampshire, where the Democratic candidates won despite the gun group's opposition. In Nevada, a battleground state like Ohio, the NRA plowed $2.4 million into the race to stop Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. She won narrowly. \"They spent millions of dollars to try to beat me and didn't,\" said Masto, a former federal prosecutor who served for eight years as Nevada's attorney general before her Senate run. \"It was ridiculous.\" ___",

            "article_content": "Rep. Mark SanfordDon't cross President Donald Trump. That's the lesson many Republicans are drawing from Rep. Mark Sanford's surprise defeat Tuesday in his primary election in South Carolina. The victor, state Rep. Katie Arrington, repeatedly highlighted Sanford's criticism of the president. The outcome is a cautionary tale for Republicans in Congress who try to work with Trump while also maintaining their independence. One wrong turn \u2014 or in Sanford's case, many \u2014 and they could face the wrath of a president who is quick to attack detractors as enemies, even in his own party. \"That's ultimately what the race devolved down to, which was, was I Trump enough?\" Sanford told reporters on Capitol Hill. \"It's a very tribal environment right now,\" he said. \"Are you for or against Trump?\" He said he hoped his defeat would not dissuade other members from speaking out against Trump. Agreeing to disagree is \"a sign of health in our political system.\" Sanford is the second incumbent House Republican to lose a primary this year, though the defeat of Rep. Robert Pittenger in North Carolina came despite his staunch support for the president. Still, Sanford is only the latest casualty in the intra-party conflict that has roiled the GOP in the Trump era. Trump is known to remember slights from lawmakers. A second incumbent Republican congressman loses his seat in a primary featuring intense divisions among the GOP in the Trump era. (June 13) Rep. Martha Roby, for example, was forced into a runoff last week in Alabama after her opponents seized on her own rift with the president. In 2016, after the release of a tape in which candidate Trump bragged about grabbing women, Roby said she wouldn't vote for him for president. Recent results have a message, said Rep. Barry Loudermilk in neighboring Georgia. Be a team player or Trump will support someone who will be. \"It doesn't make me nervous, but it probably gives pause to some who want to openly criticize the president,\" he said. Trump celebrated Sanford's defeat on Twitter, claiming success in ousting a foe. In a highly unusual move for a president, he had tweeted an endorsement of Arrington on Tuesday afternoon when polls were still open in South Carolina. \"My political representatives didn't want me to get involved in the Mark Sanford primary thinking that Sanford would easily win - but with a few hours left I felt that Katie was such a good candidate, and Sanford was so bad, I had to give it a shot,\" he said. The transformation of the GOP under Trump makes some lawmakers uneasy. It's \"becoming a cultish thing, isn't it?\" said retiring Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who has an on-off relationship with Trump. \"And it's not a good place for any party to end up with a cult-like situation.\" To be sure, the president's track record of picking winners and losers in elections is not perfect. He also backed Gov. Henry McMaster, who replaced Nikki Haley in South Carolina, but McMaster was forced into a primary runoff with Greenville businessman John Warren. And Trump famously backed Roy Moore, the former Alabama judge accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, in a special election earlier this year that delivered the state's first Democrat to the U.S. Senate in a generation. But Trump's preference for populist candidates like Corey Stewart, the Confederate-statue-supporting Republican who won the GOP nomination for Senate in Virginia on Tuesday, increasingly seems to be remaking the GOP, if not Congress, in his image. Stewart will face Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic Party's 2016 vice presidential nominee, in the fall. As former Speaker John Boehner said recently, \"There is no Republican Party. There's a Trump Party.\" Recent polls have found that more than 80 percent of Republican voters approve of the job Trump is doing, and that makes GOP lawmakers hesitant to criticize him. \"Yes, of course it's his party,\" said Doug Heye, a former top House GOP leadership aide who is now a party strategist. \"That's only more true today, given his high popularity among Republican voters.\" He said lawmakers would be wise to keep their differences with the president low-key and within the range of policy, not personality, so as not to alienate Republican primary voters protective of the commander in chief. \"What they will not support is someone they view as going after the president personally,\" Heye said. Sanford, the former South Carolina governor, had never lost an election before Tuesday, even after a high-profile extramarital affair with a woman in Argentina. But he was never a strong Trump fan. He demurred during the run-up to the 2016 election when asked if he'd support Trump and spoke out against the president after the election on issues such as limiting Muslim immigrants. He also voted against a border wall proposal, called Trump's proposed tariffs on aluminum and steel \"an experiment with stupidity\" and was unrelenting in calling for Trump to release his tax returns. Arrington, the first-term state lawmaker who defeated him on Tuesday, aired ads that featured clips of Sanford speaking critically about Trump's actions. Still, she didn't initially support Trump's candidacy either. \"LOVE MITT ROMNEY!!!!!\" Arrington wrote on Facebook in 2016. She later told AP that while she supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary, she eventually backed Trump and \"proudly\" attended his inauguration House Speaker Paul Ryan downplayed the rift between Sanford and Trump Wednesday and said there are always going to be winners and losers in the same party during primary season. \"That's just what happens in contested primaries,\" said the speaker, who is retiring rather than seek re-election. Others, though, said Sanford's defeat is an up-close example of how Republicans must tread carefully in the Trump era. Trump ally Rep. Chris Collins of New York offered advice to fellow GOP lawmakers: Say something nice before you bring Trump any complaints. \"I would start by praising the president ... and then say, 'But here's an issue in my local area where I have some disagreement or I'd like to be something different,'\" Collins said. Talking to Trump should be like interactions with your spouse or children when you have a problem that needs airing, he said. Don't just come out immediately \"with smash mouth football.\" Loudermilk said it's best for lawmakers to take their concerns privately to the White House, as he said he has done behind the scenes on Trump's proposed tariffs. \"If it's something I disagree on, it doesn't necessarily mean you have to go out and broadcast it to the world.\"",

            "article_content": "Republican U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn repeatedly attempted to tie her Democratic opponent Phil Bredesen to national Democrats in their second and final debate on Wednesday, while the former Tennessee governor deflected the attacks by once again promising to improve bipartisanship in Congress. The two candidates exchanged barbs and and went on the attack during Wednesday's hour-long event \u2014 based at the University of Tennessee's Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy \u2014 on topics ranging from health care, sexual misconduct allegations to gun control. With election day less than a month away, the outcome of the competitive red-state race has attracted the national spotlight due to a 51-49 Republican Senate majority in the balance. The race has become so high-profile that even pop superstar Taylor Swift broke her political silence by going on Instagram to endorse Bredesen and encourage people to vote Nov. 6. Despite Bredesen kicking off the debate pleading for civil discourse, Blackburn immediately jumped into attacking Bredesen for attending a fundraiser that headlined ex-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. \"That was possibly the shortest civil debate we've had in a long time,\" Bredesen responded.\u00a0 Bredesen later said he didn't seek out Bloomberg's assistance but that Bloomberg called and offered his help. Blackburn said after the debate Bredesen and Bloomberg probably talked about \"taking guns away from Tennesseans\" or being a running mate with the gun control advocate in 2020.\u00a0 The two sparred over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford's allegations. Though both candidates supported President Donald Trump's nomination, Bredesen didn't do so until much later while Blackburn endorsed Kavanaugh almost immediately. \"What I wanted to do was listen and to actually have hearings,\" Bredesen said. \"I wish there had been more information. That could have changed my mind.\" Blackburn in turn said she believed something happened to Ford, but said Tennessee voters wanted Kavanaugh to be confirmed. However, she spent the majority of her answer pivoting away from the judicial nomination process to criticize the handling of sexual misconduct allegations when Bredesen was governor. \"Phil said that he did not think men and women, when they were in the workplace together, that you just had these issues of sexual harassment,\" Blackburn said. \"I think that is something that is an insult to women who were in the workplace and maybe he thinks I ought not be on this stage tonight.\" Bredesen denied the congresswoman's characterization of his attitude during his time as governor, and instead countered he successfully worked to protect the privacy of victims as governor. Some sexual misconduct case records were shredded during Bredesen's administration, a policy that he stopped as governor. For the majority of the debate, Blackburn used former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as her example of Democrats Bredesen supports in almost all of her responses to questions. She routinely repeated that he gave $33,400 to Clinton's presidential bid and eventually hinted that Bredesen would move his desk to sit next to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren if elected. The tactic was similar to how she argued during the first debate, but instead attempted to tie him Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2014 someone Bredesen said he would not vote for in the Senate. Bredesen countered Congress needed less \"party tribalism\" and more independent thinkers willing to work with both political parties, even going as far as saying he would support Blackburn if she were elected. On gun control, Bredesen called for stronger background checks while Blackburn called for more secure schools. Both supported a system that would flag those with mental illnesses seeking to buy guns while both reiterating their support of the Second Amendment. The two were also asked to give their opinion of retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker \u2014 the seat they're hoping to secure \u2014 which they both graded him as doing a wonderful job while in office. Blackburn said she hoped to keep the seat Republican, while Bredesen went on the defensive when asked by a moderator if he only praised Corker to prevent the senator from attacking the Democrat. \"I've known him for a long time, so no,\" he said. Neither candidate was asked about the state's growing opioid crisis \u2014 a central policy issue throughout the campaign and talking point for multiple television and digital ads. Instead, they fielded questions on expanding the military to include Trump's proposed \"Space Force.\" Blackburn said she was in favor and Bredesen said he was open to the idea, but would need more information. Finally, Bredesen said he supported strengthening the U.S. borders but that actually building a physical wall was just \"political theater.\" Blackburn disagreed, \"Just ask Israel... a wall is imperative.\" The general election is Nov. 6. Early voting in Tennessee starts Oct. 17.",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK -- Eight months before the company that owns the National Enquirer paid $150,000 to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy Playmate who claimed she'd had an affair with Donald Trump, the tabloid's parent made a $30,000 payment to a less famous individual: Dino Sajudin,a former doorman at one of the real estate mogul's New York City buildings. As it did with the ex-Playmate, the Enquirer signed the ex-doorman to a contract that effectively prevented him from going public with a juicy tale that might hurt Trump's campaign for president. The payout to the former Playmate, Karen McDougal, stayed a secret until the Wall Street Journal published a story about it days before Election Day. Since then curiosity about that deal has spawned intense media coverage and, this week, helped prompt the FBI to raid the hotel room and offices of Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. The story of ex-doorman Dino Sajudin, hasn't been told until now. The Associated Press confirmed the details of the Enquirer's payment through a review of a confidential contract and interviews with dozens of current and former employees of the Enquirer and its parent company, American Media Inc. Sajudin got $30,000 in exchange for signing over the rights, \"in perpetuity,\" to a rumor he'd heard about Trump's sex life -- that the president had fathered an illegitimate child with an employee at Trump World Tower, a skyscraper he owns near the United Nations. The contract subjected Sajudin to a $1 million penalty if he disclosed either the rumor or the terms of the deal to anyone. Cohen, the longtime Trump attorney, acknowledged to the AP that he had discussed Sajudin's story with the magazine when the tabloid was working on it. He said he was acting as a Trump spokesman when he did so and denied knowing anything beforehand about the Enquirer payment to the ex-doorman. Sajudin's attorney spokesperson issued the following statement to CBS News: \"Today I awoke to learn that a confidential agreement that I had with AMI (The National Enquirer) with regard to a story about President Trump was leaked to the press.\u00a0 I can confirm that while working at Trump World Tower I was instructed not to criticize President Trump's former housekeeper due to a prior relationship she had with President Trump which produced a child.\" The parallel between the ex-Playmate's and the ex-doorman's dealings with the Enquirer raises new questions about the roles that the Enquirer and Cohen may have played in protecting Trump's image during a hard-fought presidential election. Prosecutors are probing whether Cohen broke banking or campaign laws in connection with AMI's payment to McDougal and a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels that Cohen said he paid out of his own pocket. Federal investigators have sought communications between Cohen, American Media's chief executive and the Enquirer's top editor, the New York Times reported. Cohen's lawyer has called the raids \"inappropriate and unnecessary.\" American Media hasn't said whether federal authorities have sought information from it, but said this week that it would \"comply with any and all requests that do not jeopardize or violate its protected sources or materials pursuant to our First Amendment rights.\" The White House didn't respond to questions seeking comment. On Wednesday, an Enquirer sister publication, RadarOnline, published details of the payment and the rumor that Sajudin was peddling. The website wrote that the Enquirer spent four weeks reporting the story but ultimately decided it wasn't true.\u00a0 The company only released Sajudin from his contract after the 2016 election amid inquiries from the Journal about the payment.\u00a0 The site noted that the AP was among a group of publications that had been investigating the ex-doorman's tip. During AP's reporting, AMI threatened legal action over reporters' efforts to interview current and former employees and hired the New York law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, which challenged the accuracy of the AP's reporting. Asked about the payment last summer, Dylan Howard, the Enquirer's top editor and an AMI executive, said he made the payment to secure the former Trump doorman's exclusive cooperation because the tip, if true, would have sold \"hundreds of thousands\" of magazines. Ultimately, he said the information \"lacked any credibility,\" so he spiked the story on those merits. \"Unfortunately...Dino Sajudin is one fish that swam away,\" Howard told RadarOnline on Wednesday. But four longtime Enquirer staffers directly familiar with the episode challenged Howard's version of events. They said they were ordered by top editors to stop pursuing the story before completing potentially promising reporting threads. They said the publication didn't pursue standard Enquirer reporting practices, such as exhaustive stake-outs or tabloid tactics designed to prove paternity. In 2008, the Enquirer helped bring down presidential hopeful John Edwards in part by digging through a dumpster and retrieving material to do a DNA test that indicated he had fathered a child with a mistress, according to a former staffer. The woman at the center of the rumor about Trump denied emphatically to the AP last August that she'd ever had an affair with Trump, saying she had no idea the Enquirer had paid Sajudin and pursued his tip. The AP has not been able to determine if the rumor is true and is not naming the woman. \"This is all fake,\" she said. \"I think they lost their money.\" The Enquirer staffers, all with years of experience negotiating source contracts, said the abrupt end to reporting combined with a binding, seven-figure penalty to stop the tipster from talking to anyone led them to conclude that this was a so-called \"catch and kill\" - a tabloid practice in which a publication pays for a story to never run, either as a favor to the celebrity subject of the tip or as leverage over that person. One former Enquirer reporter, who was not involved in the Sajudin reporting effort, expressed skepticism that the company would pay for the tip and not publish. \"AMI doesn't go around cutting checks for $30,000 and then not using the information,\" said Jerry George, a reporter and senior editor for nearly three decades at AMI before his layoff in 2013. The company said that AMI's publisher, David Pecker, an unabashed Trump supporter, had not coordinated its coverage with Trump associates or taken direction from Trump. It acknowledged discussing the former doorman's tip with Trump's representatives, which it described as \"standard operating procedure in stories of this nature.\" The Enquirer staffers, like many of the dozens of other current and former AMI employees interviewed by the AP in the past year, spoke on condition of anonymity. All said AMI required them to sign nondisclosure agreements barring them from discussing internal editorial policy and decision-making. Though sometimes dismissed by mainstream publications, the Enquirer's history of breaking legitimate scoops about politicians' personal lives - including its months-long Pulitzer Prize-contending coverage of presidential candidate Edwards' affair - is a point of pride in its newsroom. During the 2016 presidential campaign, the Enquirer published a string of allegations against Trump's rivals, such as stories claiming Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was a bisexual \"secret sex freak\" and was kept alive only by a \"narcotics cocktail.\" Stories attacking Trump rivals or promoting Trump's campaign often bypassed the paper's normal fact-checking process, according to two people familiar with campaign-era copy. The tabloid made its first-ever endorsement by officially backing Trump for the White House. With just over a week before Election Day, Howard, the top editor, appeared on Alex Jones' InfoWars program by phone, telling listeners that the choice at the ballot box was between \"the Clinton crime family\" or someone who will \"break down the borders of the establishment.\" Howard said the paper's coverage was bipartisan, citing negative stories it published about Ben Carson during the Republican presidential primaries. In a statement last summer, Howard said the company doesn't take editorial direction \"from anyone outside AMI,\" and said Trump has never been an Enquirer source. The company has said reader surveys dictate its coverage and that many of its customers are Trump supporters. The company has said it paid McDougal, the former Playboy Playmate, to be a columnist for an AMI-published fitness magazine, not to stay silent. McDougal has since said that she regrets signing the non-disclosure agreement and is currently suing to get out of it. Pecker has denied burying negative stories about Trump, but acknowledged to the New Yorker last summer that McDougal's contract had effectively silenced her. \"Once she's part of the company, then on the outside she can't be bashing Trump and American Media,\" Pecker said. In the tabloid world purchasing information is not uncommon, and the Enquirer routinely pays sources. As a general practice, however, sources agree to be paid for their tips only upon publication. George, the longtime former reporter and editor, said the $1 million penalty in Sajudin's agreement was larger than anything he had seen in his Enquirer career. \"If your intent is to get a story from the source, there's no upside to paying upfront,\" said George, who sometimes handled catch-and-kill contracts related to other celebrities. Paying upfront was not the Enquirer's usual practice because it would have been costly and endangered the source's incentive to cooperate, he said. After initially calling the Enquirer's tip line, Sajudin signed a boilerplate contract with the Enquirer, agreeing to be an anonymous source and be paid upon publication. The Enquirer dispatched reporters to pursue the story both in New York and in California. The tabloid also sent a polygraph expert to administer a lie detection test to Sajudin in a hotel near his Pennsylvania home. Sajudin passed the polygraph, which tested how he learned of the rumor. One week later, Sajudin signed an amended agreement, this one paying him $30,000 immediately and subjecting him to the $1 million penalty if he shopped around his information. The Enquirer immediately then stopped reporting, said the former staffers. Cohen, last year, characterized the Enquirer's payment to Sajudin as wasted money for a baseless story. For his part, Sajudin confirmed he'd been paid to be the tabloid's anonymous source but insisted he would sue the Enquirer if his name appeared in print. Pressed for more details about his tip and experience with the paper, Sajudin said he would talk only for in exchange for payment. \"If there's no money involved with it,\" he said, \"I'm not getting involved.\"",

            "article_content": "Tonight you will hear from the man President Donald Trump appointed as his 2020 re-election campaign manager. His name is Brad Parscale, and he got the job because - as we first reported in October - Parscale was the president's secret weapon in his 2016 run for the White House.\u00a0 42-year-old Parscale was one of the campaign's top decision-makers, operating largely out of public view. He was hired to run the digital team, but over time he came to oversee advertising, data collection and much of the fund-raising. He says his main task was competing with the Clinton Campaign's huge advantage in money and tv ads. What he decided to do was turn to social media, most importantly to Facebook. Brad Parscale: I understood early that Facebook was how Donald Trump was going to win. Twitter is how he talked to the people. Facebook was going to be how he won. Lesley Stahl: And Facebook IS how he won. Brad Parscale: I think so.\u00a0 I think Donald Trump won, but I think Facebook was the method -- it was the highway in which his car drove on. And Brad Parscale was in the driver's seat. \u00a0In the beginning of the campaign he worked alone at home in San Antonio, but by the end he had 100 people reporting to him. One of his main jobs was to send out carefully-tailored, low-cost digital ads to millions of people. Lesley Stahl: And these were ads on Facebook? Brad Parscale: Facebook, we did 'em on Twitter, Google search, other platforms. Facebook was the 500-pound gorilla, 80 percent of the budget kind of thing. Facebook's advertising technology helped President Obama in 2012, but today Facebook offers something far more precise and sophisticated. While the president tweeted in the past that \"Facebook was always anti-Trump,\" Parscale relied heavily on the company. Particularly on its cutting-edge targeting tools. Lesley Stahl: One of the best things Facebook did for you, I heard, was penetrate the rural vote. Is that correct? Brad Parscale: Yeah. So Facebook now lets you get to places and places possibly that you would never go with TV ads. Now, I can find, you know, 15 people in the Florida Panhandle that I would never buy a TV commercial for. And, we took opportunities that I think the other side didn't. Lesley Stahl: Like what? Brad Parscale: Well, we had our-- their staff embedded inside our offices. Lesley Stahl: What? Brad Parscale: Yeah, Facebook employees would show up for work every day in our offices. Lesley Stahl: Whoa, wait a minute. Facebook employees showed up at the Trump headquarters -- Brad Parscale: Google employees, and Twitter employees. Lesley Stahl: They were embedded in your campaign? Brad Parscale: I mean, like, they were there multiple days a week, three, four days a week, two days week, five days a week -- Lesley Stahl: What were they doing inside? I mean -- Brad Parscale: Helping teach us how to use their platform. I wanna get -- Lesley Stahl: Helping him get elected? Brad Parscale: I asked each one of them by email, I wanna know every, single secret button, click, technology you have. \"I wanna know everything you would tell Hillary's campaign plus some. And I want your people here to teach me how to use it.\" Lesley Stahl: Inside? Brad Parscale: Yeah, I want 'em sittin' right next to us -- Lesley Stahl: How do you know they weren't Trojan Horses? Brad Parscale: 'Cause I'd ask 'em to be Republicans, and I'd -- we'd talk to 'em. Lesley Stahl: Oh, you only wanted Republicans? Brad Parscale: I wanted people who support Donald Trump from their companies. Lesley Stahl: And that's what you got? Brad Parscale: Yeah. They already have divisions set up that way. Lesley Stahl: What do you mean? Brad Parscale: They already have groups of people in their political divisions that are Republican and Democrat. Lesley Stahl: You're kidding? Brad Parscale: Yeah, they're businesses, they are publicly traded companies with stock price. Lesley Stahl: Did Hillary's campaign have someone embedded -- Brad Parscale: I had heard that they didn't accept any of their offers. Lesley Stahl: So you're saying Facebook and the others offered an embed, and they said no. Brad Parscale: That's what I've heard. People in the Clinton campaign confirmed that the offer was made and turned down. \u00a0Facebook told us in a statement: \"...for candidates across the political spectrum, Facebook offers the same levels of support in key moments to help campaigns understand how best to use the platform.\" And indeed, both campaigns used Facebook's technology extensively to reach out to potential voters. Parscale said the Trump campaign used the technology to microtarget on a scale never seen before -- and to customize their ads for individual voters. Brad Parscale: We were making hundreds of thousands of 'em. Lesley Stahl: You make 100,000 ads. Brad Parscale: Programmatically. In one day. In one day. Lesley Stahl: So 100,000 different ads every day? Brad Parscale: Average day 50-60 thousands ads. This was all automated. Brad Parscale: Changing language, words, colors, changing things because certain people like a green button better than a blue button. Some people like the word \"donate\" or \"contribute.\" Lesley Stahl: So how would you know ... let's say I like a green button. How do you know I'd only like a green button? Brad Parscale: Because I'd give you the red, blue buttons, you never click on 'em. Parscale showed us how they tested: by sending out multiple versions of the same ad with only subtle differences. Brad Parscale: Here we have an American flag, here we have a face of Hillary. Different colors, the blues, different messages above. Lesley Stahl: So you'd send two identical ads with different colors? Brad Parscale: Maybe thousands. Lesley Stahl: You'd send THOUSAND of ads with different colors? Brad Parscale: Different colors. What it is is: what can make people react? What catches their attention? Remember, there's so much noise on your phone. You know, or on your desktop. What is it that makes it go: Poof! \"I'm gonna stop and look.\" To get people to stop and look, he crafted different messages for different people -- so that you only got ads about the issues you cared about most. He showed us three ads that looked alike. Brad Parscale: It's pretty much the identical design. Positive coloring. Different message. Lesley Stahl: This is one is tax, this one is childcare, this one is energy. Brad Parscale: They were all targeted to different users of whatever platform, in this case it was Facebook. Sent out to different people. And it could be each other's next-door neighbors\u2026all in Ohio. Lesley Stahl: This one person at 11 Elm Street gets this one and 13 Elm Street gets that one. Brad Parscale: Yup, yup. Parscale took some heat for taking micro targeting too far because he hired Cambridge Analytica. The company, now defunct, used so-called psycho-graphics that micro-target ads based on personality. For instance, an extrovert would get one kind of message, a neurotic person another. It's controversial because of its Orwellian overtones.\u00a0 After Trump won, Cambridge Analytica said it was key to the victory. But Parscale insists he never used psychographics. He said it doesn't work. Lesley Stahl: So you didn't use it because you didn't think it really worked, as opposed to you didn't use it because you thought it was wrong that it was manipulative or sinister, or something like that. Brad Parscale: No, I don't believe it's sinister. Lesley Stahl: No. OK, you just don't think it works. Brad Parscale: No, I just don't think it works. Parscale's title was digital director, but by the end of the campaign his portfolio grew. He oversaw data collection, polling, advertising both online and on TV, and significantly digital fund raising. By adding donation buttons for people to click on in the online ads, he was able to bring in a record $240 million in small donations. Lesley Stahl: How many presidential campaigns had you worked on before this one? Brad Parscale: Zero. Lesley Stahl: Your wife has a wonderful expression about you being thrown into this. Brad Parscale: Yeah.\u00a0 She said that I was thrown into the Super Bowl, never played a game and won. Lesley Stahl: That's what it sounds like. It's made him a local hero back home in Kansas. He grew up in Topeka, playing basketball -- he's 6 foot 8. After briefly working at a tech company in California, he moved to San Antonio, Texas, and became a marketer. He taught himself to code, opened a small web-design business and went looking for customers. Brad Parscale: I started tapping shoulders at a bookstore asking people if they needed a website, when they were buying books on web design. Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what-- you're hanging around at a bookstore? Brad Parscale: Yeah, a Border's. Lesley Stahl: You're hanging around at Border's and say, \"Can you hire me?\" Brad Parscale: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: Come-on. Brad Parscale: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: So how did you get involved with the Trump people? Brad Parscale: I was sitting at IHOP and I got an email. I was eating a ham and cheese omelet. I was. I get an email and I open it up and it says -- \"This is Kathy K. from the Trump Org -- can you please call me?\" That's it -- Lesley Stahl: Outta nowhere? Brad Parscale: Outta nowhere. Six years ago she was looking for someone to design a website for a Trump real estate project. Parscale bid lowest, got the job, and soon many more followed: websites for Eric's foundation, Melania's skincare line, the family's wineries. Then, in early 2015, came another life-changing email: Brad Parscale: It said \"Donald Trump is thinking about running for president. We need a website in two days.\" So I wrote back, I said, \"Yeah, I'll do it for $1,500.\" Lesley Stahl: $1,500? Brad Parscale: Yeah. And by the end, it was $94 million. $94 million is what his company was paid. Much of it was spent on things like buying ads.\u00a0 Parscale learned very fast on the job, with the help of the Republican National Committee. They had amassed a giant database to identify the issues people cared about, and predict how nearly 200 million Americans would vote. One reason Parscale thinks President Trump won is because of an issue the RNC database honed in on that he says the Clinton campaign missed: Lesley Stahl: Infrastructure. Brad Parscale: Infrastructure. It was voters in the rust belt that cared about their roads being rebuilt, their highways, their bridges. They felt like the world was crumbling. So I started making ads that would show the bridge crumbling. You know, that's microtargeting them. Because I can find the 1,500 people in one town that care about infrastructure. Now, that might be a voter that normally votes Democrat. While he tried to persuade Democrats to vote for Mr. Trump -- the campaign was accused, in a Businessweek article, of trying to suppress the vote of \"idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans,\" a charge he denies. Lesley Stahl: Did you micro target by race? Brad Parscale: No we did not. Not at all. Lesley Stahl: Never? Brad Parscale: Nope. Lesley Stahl: Did you post hateful images? Brad Parscale: I don't believe so. Lesley Stahl: The candidate Trump was never shy about pushing buttons, about pushing prejudices. He used what most people would consider offensive language sometimes. Brad Parscale: I don't think the math said that most people saw it as offensive. I think a small group of people saw it as offensive, who have a lot of power. Lesley Stahl: But you did mirror him? Brad Parscale: We mirrored certain things that he would say, mainly things he said in rallies. Many of the messages he sent out were what's known as dark ads. They're called dark because they're microtargeted to individual users who are the only ones who see them.\u00a0 Unless they choose to share them \u2013 they disappear.\u00a0 Lesley Stahl: Can you say anything you want in those dark ads? They're really not transparent? Brad Parscale: No, because if I said something crazy in those, they would share a million times, it would be all over. Lesley Stahl: So if you said something that appealed to racists? Brad Parscale: Oh, it would be everywhere. But some dark ads flew under the radar, like ones sent out, we now know, by the Russians in their attempt to influence our election. These were separate from the posts the Russians reportedly sent of fake news stories that made Clinton look bad. The ads\u00a0-- on divisive issues -- were spread using Facebook tools similar to the ones Parscale and the Clinton campaign used. Lesley Stahl: Facebook has admitted that the Russians spent $100,000 -- at least $100,000 -- on ads to influence the U.S. campaign. Does that bother you? Brad Parscale: Yeah, I would not want a foreign entity to meddle in our election; you know, a government. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't want that; I'm American. But the question is: did the Trump campaign collude with the Russians -- and as the digital director, was Parscale involved? Brad Parscale: I think it's a joke. Like, at least for my part in it. Lesley Stahl: Very few people think it's a joke. Brad Parscale: I think it's a joke when they involve myself. 'Cause I know my own activities, and I know the activities of this campaign. I was there. It's just a farce. Lesley Stahl: It's a farce that you colluded with the Russians? Brad Parscale: Yeah. It's just a joke. What about what happened on Twitter? Which was flooded with pro-Trump tweets generated by robots, or bots. Lesley Stahl: Did you have a hand in generating these bots -- Brad Parscale: I had nothing to do with bots. I don't think bots work. Lesley Stahl: You were called the king of the bots. Brad Parscale: I know. It's ridiculous. It's just the craziest thing ever. No one on our team ever sat down with me and said, \"Brad, we should make bots.\" Lesley Stahl: But if-- if you see that there are hundreds of thousands of bots floating around with pro-Trump messages, somebody generated it. Where would it come from? Brad Parscale: I would imagine there were people, everyday people in America, who thought they were trying to help. I don't know. Lesley Stahl: If the bots came from the Russians, would you know? Brad Parscale:\u00a0 Nah. Lesley Stahl: Do you think it might have? Brad Parscale:\u00a0 No idea. Lesley Stahl: Could it have? Brad Parscale: Could be from anybody in the world. Both the House and Senate intelligence committees looking into Russia's meddling met Parscale for lengthy closed door sessions. Parscale told us the Russian plotline is pushed by liberals who think they lost because he cheated. The irony, he says, is that it wasn't a foreign entity helping the campaign, but left-leaning American companies like Twitter, Google, and above all Facebook. Brad Parscale: These social platforms are all invented by very liberal people on the West and East Coast, and we figure out how to use it to push conservative values. I don't think they ever thought that would happen. I would say the number one thing that people come up to me is, like, \"I just never thought Republicans would be the ones to figure out how to use all this.\" Lesley Stahl: So a liberal invents all this stuff and a conservative in the Middle-West figures out how to use it? Brad Parscale: And I think we used it better than anyone ever had in history. Facing mounting criticism over dark ads with political content, Facebook is in the process of updating its policies, including doing a better job disclosing who's paying for these ads, and creating a central depository of all the ads, so anyone can scrutinize their content.

            "article_content": "Although Democrats have a chance to take the House of Representatives in November, they face an uphill battle in keeping all of their seats in the Senate, much less gaining the majority. With a razor-thin margin of 49 Democrats to 51 Republicans, a handful of critical races could decide which party controls the Senate.\u00a0 In August, CBS News took a look at the Senate races to watch in Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. One month later, those races remain tight, with developments in polling, endorsements and voter sentiment. In the final weeks of the campaign, Ohio and Montana also have Senate races that bear watching. Republican candidate: Martha McSallyDemocratic candidate: Kyrsten SinemaCBS News Battleground Tracker rating: Toss up Arizona is the deep-red home state of Barry Goldwater and John McCain, but Democrats are hoping that urbanization and demographic changes will turn its open Senate seat blue this November. Rep. Martha McSally is the Republican nominee for departing Sen. Jeff Flake's seat, after handily defeating right-wingers Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio. She is facing Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate Democrat who has voted in line with President Trump's policies around 60 percent of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight. She is also a member of the Blue Dog Coalition in the House, and the New Democrat caucus, which describes itself as \"committed to pro-economic growth, pro-innovation, and fiscally responsible policies.\" National Democrats had hoped that Sinema would face one of the more controversial candidates in November, allowing her to attract some moderate Republicans as she hews towards the center. Nonetheless, Sinema appears to be holding her own against Ward. Earlier this month, a Fox News poll found Sinema three points ahead of McSally, and a CNN poll released in mid-September showed her to be seven points ahead of McSally. A CBS News Battleground Tracker poll published Oct. 7 showed Sinema with 47 percent support among likely voters and McSally with 44 percent support. However, Sinema has come under fire for her conflicting statements on her childhood. She has described a hardscrabble upbringing, where her family at one point lived in an abandoned gas station. Sinema has claimed that she lived without electricity or running water, but The New York Times found records of electric, phone and gas bills being paid during the time that her family lived in that building. Regardless of who wins in November, Arizona will be sending a woman to the Senate for the first time in state history. Republican candidate: Rick ScottDemocratic candidate: Bill Nelson (incumbent)CBS News Battleground Tracker rating: Toss up Term-limited Republican Gov. Rick Scott has the funds, the social media presence and broad support across Florida. Scott raised $22 million in the second quarter, while Nelson received $4.4 million in donations. Scott is also a multi-millionaire who could potentially spend a tremendous amount of his own money in the state's expensive media markets.\u00a0 Scott has also been making appeals to demographic groups traditionally presumed to lean Democratic, especially Hispanic voters. Cuban-American voters in the state have historically leaned Republican, but Democrats are hoping that an influx of Puerto Rican voters will move the state more into the Democratic column. However, the race has been in some sense dominated by the encroaching toxic algae bloom on the state's southeastern coastline. Nelson and Scott blame each other for the problem, and have released attack ads on the issue. Democrats have also hit Scott on his forced ousting from his position as chief executive of Columbia/HCA, an insurance company in 1997, amid a federal fraud investigation. Although Scott was never charged with any wrongdoing, the health care conglomerate paid a then-record $1.7 billion fine for Medicare fraud. A Quinnipiac University poll released Sept. 25 showed Nelson with a seven-point lead over Scott, with 53 percent of support among likely voters compared to Scott's 46 percent. Nelson leads Scott with independent voters, women, black and Hispanic voters. Republican candidate: Mike BraunDemocratic candidate: Joe Donnelly (incumbent)CBS News Battleground Tracker rating: Toss up Donnelly is one of the most vulnerable incumbent Democrats in the country, and being directly targeted by Mr. Trump isn't helping his cause. The president has visited Indiana twice to stump for Republican Mike Braun, most recently in late August, referring to Donnelly as \"Sleepy Joe\" and a \"swamp person.\" Mr. Trump won Indiana by 20 points in 2016. Braun is a business executive who injected millions into his campaign during the primary race. However, Donnelly has outspent him in television and radio ads, according to the Associated Press.\u00a0 Indiana is solidly Republican, but like many other Democrats running for re-election in states which Mr. Trump won, Donnelly is hoping to attract voters who typically support Republicans in presidential years. In order to do that, he's been trying to emphasize his ties to the president. In July, Donnelly\u00a0released an ad\u00a0that quotes Mr. Trump's praise of the senator at a bill signing in May. He also released an ad\u00a0in September titled \"Working,\" where he highlighted his \"joining with President Trump to build a wall and protect our borders.\" An NBC News/Marist College poll from September showed Donnelly with a slight edge in the race, with support from 49 percent of likely voters, compared to 43 percent for Braun. Republican candidate: Josh HawleyDemocratic candidate: Claire McCaskill (incumbent)CBS News Battleground Tracker rating: Toss up McCaskill famously ran ads during the 2012 Republican senate primary to boost what her team saw as her weakest prospective opponent, then-Rep. Todd Akin. Sure enough, Akin won the primary and quickly imploded after making comments about \"legitimate rape\" that caused the national GOP to all but leave him for dead.\u00a0 This year, however, Republicans learned their lesson, quickly coalescing around state Attorney General Josh Hawley. Although the state Republican Party endured a major scandal when GOP Gov. Eric Greitens resigned after being accused of blackmailing and assaulting a woman with whom he had had an affair, that scandal may not affect Hawley. While McCaskill is running on her record of coming to bipartisan agreements, Hawley is tacking to the right. He has embraced Mr. Trump, and called McCaskill a \"Washington liberal\" multiple times in their first debate. A recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll found the two candidates tied, each with 45 percent support among likely voters. And having under 50 percent support in a tough re-election year is not ideal for the incumbent. Health care is a huge issue in the campaign. As attorney general, Hawley has brought forward a lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act, a fact McCaskill has tried to use to her advantage. But Hawley says that he does not support taking away coverage for people with preexisting conditions, and that this coverage could be provided through the state. Hawley is betting that Missourians will vote to elect a senator who represents what it actually is: a solidly Republican state. But McCaskill is hoping that her track record and knowledge of Missouri will be enough to carry her through another difficult election. Republican candidate: Matt RosendaleDemocratic candidate: Jon Tester (incumbent)CBS News Battleground Tracker rating: Edge Democrat Tester, like Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, is a moderate Democrat who has managed to stay afloat -- and relatively popular -- in a state which Mr. Trump won by 20 points in 2016. That same year, Bullock won his re-election by four points, far outperforming Hillary Clinton. Montana has a recent history of split-ticket voting, which could keep Tester in the Senate despite Montana's Republican lean.\u00a0 Tester, a skilled campaigner who is seeking his third term in the Senate, has carved a niche for himself as a moderate Democrat. He is a gun owner who has voted against background checks and has been given an A- grade from the National Rifle Association.\u00a0 However, he has invoked the ire of Mr. Trump, having voted against the president's Supreme Court nominees. He also led the charge against Dr. Ronny Jackson's nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs earlier this year. As the ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Tester raised concerns about allegations of professional misbehavior by Jackson, who denied the accusations. Jackson eventually withdrew his nomination. Mr. Trump campaigned in Montana for Tester's Republican opponent, Matt Rosendale, in September. He raised Tester's opposition to Jackson as a mark against the senator. \"Jon Tester will never drain the swamp because he happens to live in the swamp and he loves the swamp,\" Mr. Trump said at the rally. Despite the president's disapproval, Tester seems to be staying afloat. A recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll found him two points ahead of Rosendale, with 47 percent support from likely voters, compared to Rosendale's 45 percent support. Republican candidate: Dean Heller (incumbent)Democratic candidate: Jacky RosenCBS News Battleground Tracker rating: Toss up Heller is the only vulnerable Republican senator on this list. Clinton won Nevada by two points, and Heller's opponent, Rep. Jacky Rosen, is a high-profile Democratic recruit who won her district in 2016 even though it went for Mr. Trump. Heller can't even hope to ride on the coattails of popular Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, as Sandoval is term-limited and has shown his distaste for the Republican candidate attempting to replace him in the toss-up gubernatorial race. In the run-up to the 2016 election, Heller famously said that he was 99 percent against Mr. Trump. But times have changed, and would-be primary challenger Danny Tarkanian\u00a0dropped out of the race after Mr. Trump endorsed Heller.\u00a0 After equivocating on whether he would vote for the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Heller became a co-sponsor of the Graham-Cassidy bill, which would have dramatically restructured Medicaid. Sandoval expanded Medicaid in Nevada under the ACA. Rosen has hit Heller for his support of this bill in a recent ad. Mr. Trump recently traveled to Las Vegas to rally on behalf of Republican candidates in the state, including Heller. And although Heller represents Democrats' best hope for beating a Republican incumbent senator this cycle, Heller is a proven survivor, winning his seat in 2012 even as President Obama carried the state.\u00a0 Republican candidate: Kevin CramerDemocratic opponent: Heidi Heitkamp (incumbent)CBS News Battleground Tracker rating: Toss up Heitkamp has said she has a relatively close relationship with Mr. Trump for a Democrat. She was briefly considered for a cabinet position, and has sat next to the president at bill-signings and ridden on Air Force One. Mr. Trump once called her a \"good woman,\" and Heitkamp told the Washington Post in August that the president asked her to change parties. Heitkamp released an ad touting her bipartisanship, noting that she voted over half the time in line with Mr. Trump's policies. Mr. Trump's chumminess with Heitkamp evoked the annoyance of the outspoken Cramer, who this summer suggested that Mr. Trump was not targeting Heitkamp forcefully\u00a0because of her gender, according to The Washington Post. However, Mr. Trump has since gone after Heitkamp in rallies in June and September, saying that she was liberal who voted in line with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0 On the same day that Mr. Trump visited North Dakota in September, Heitkamp released an ad demonstrating her support among union workers. She is also a vocal opponent of the president's tariff policies. But Heitkamp voted against newly-appointed Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite being down 12 points in a recent Fox News poll. Republicans are hoping that the vote against Kavanaugh will weigh down Heitkamp even further. \u00a0 Mr. Trump won North Dakota by 36 points. Like many red-state Democrats, Heitkamp's strategy had been to hew to the center and emphasize her independence, her vote against Kavanaugh notwithstanding. However, the Trump brand may be too strong for Heitkamp to overcome in such a Republican state, particularly given her liberal views on social issues like abortion.\u00a0 Republican candidate: Jim RenacciDemocratic candidate: Sherrod Brown (incumbent)CBS News Battleground Tracker rating: Lean Democrat Although it is a swing state in presidential elections, Ohio's state government has become increasingly Republican, as have its federal representatives. However, Sherrod Brown -- an unabashedly populist Democrat who supports Mr. Trump's protectionist trade policies -- seems to be the exception that proves the rule.\u00a0 Brown was a potential vice presidential candidate for Clinton in 2016, and is sometimes named as a possible presidential contender in 2020. Nonetheless, Brown is relatively safe, especially compared to other Democrats up for re-election in states which Mr. Trump won. Brown is facing Renacci, a Republican congressman who was endorsed by Mr. Trump via Tweet in April. A Politico/AARP poll from September showed Brown with 47 percent support among registered voters to 31 percent support for Renacci. Twenty-two percent of voters were undecided. Although Brown is in the lead, he should not get too comfortable, as he is still a Democrat fighting for re-election in a red state in a state Mr. Trump won comfortably.\u00a0 Republican candidate: Marsha BlackburnDemocratic candidate: Phil BredesenCBS News Battleground Tracker rating: Lean Republican Bredesen, a popular moderate Democrat and former governor, is providing Blackburn with a serious challenge in this Republican-leaning state. A September CNN poll found Bredesen with 50 percent support among likely voters, compared to 45 percent support for Blackburn. Blackburn is focusing her campaign on her support for Mr. Trump, who endorsed her in May. At a rally in Nashville in May, Mr. Trump portrayed Bredesen as a tool of \"Chuck and Nancy.\" Blackburn has promised to wholeheartedly support Mr. Trump's agenda if elected, and used clips from that rally in a\u00a0recent campaign ad\u00a0touting Trump's endorsement. Despite Blackburn's Trumpworld cred, the race remains competitive. Bredesen's campaign\u00a0recently released an ad\u00a0highlighting praise that he received from Republicans when he was governor, and another that emphasizes his commitment to gun rights and high marks from the NRA when he was governor. He also said he would have voted to confirm Kavanaugh, and recently received the endorsement of musician Taylor Swift, who has in the past avoided airing her political views.\u00a0 The latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll showed Bredesen trailing Blackburn among likely voters, with 42 percent support to her 50 percent support. Republican candidate: Ted Cruz (incumbent)Democratic candidate: Beto O'RourkeCBS News Battleground Tracker rating: Lean Republican Despite much adulation from liberals and magazine writers, O'Rourke, the telegenic Democratic congressman from El Paso, faces serious hurdles in his struggle to defeat Cruz. However, despite Mr. Trump's nearly 10-point margin of victory in 2016 and Cruz's 16-point win in 2012, the buzz around O'Rourke is loud enough to suggest that the conservative incumbent may be in trouble.\u00a0 O'Rourke's tour of the state has garnered large crowds nearly everywhere he goes. He has also raised $10 million in the second quarter, compared to Cruz's $4 million. Mr. Trump has announced that he will be rallying for Cruz, his erstwhile 2016 foe, in October. Nonetheless, O'Rourke is a long shot. No Democrat has been elected statewide in Texas in 20 years, and Cruz will likely benefit from the fact that the state's popular Republican governor, Greg Abbott, is also up for reelection.\u00a0 O'Rourke has also been behind Cruz in most recent polls. Although an NBC News/Marist College poll found him four points down earlier this month, a Quinnipiac Poll saw O'Rourke trailing with 45 percent support among likely voters to Cruz's 54 percent support. A recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll was closer, with 44 percent support for O'Rourke and 50 percent for Cruz among likely voters. As in Arizona, O'Rourke's candidacy is a test of how much demographic changes have shifted a solid Republican state to the left, and whether it's enough to elect a Democrat.\u00a0 Republican candidate: Patrick MorriseyDemocratic candidate: Joe Manchin (incumbent)CBS News Battleground Tracker rating: Edge Democrat Manchin is an endangered species: the last statewide Democrat standing in West Virginia, which voted for Mr. Trump by over 40 percentage points. If anywhere can truly be defined as \"Trump country,\" it is West Virginia, where formerly Democratic Gov. Jim Justice switched to the Republican Party in 2017 at a rally Mr. Trump. Manchin has made his reputation as a conservative Democrat, voting to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in 2017 and Gina Haspel as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2018. Just last week, he became the only Democrat to break ranks and vote for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Manchin also hasn't ruled out voting for Mr. Trump in 2020. His willingness to embrace Mr. Trump may be enough to save Manchin, who is facing Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the general election. Mr. Trump rallied on behalf of Morrisey in August, where he said that \"a vote for Patrick Morrisey is truly a vote to Make America Great Again.\" Health care is also an issue in this race. Morrisey joined with Missouri's Hawley in the case against the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, Manchin's daughter, a health care CEO, was roundly criticized for raising the price of EpiPens in 2016 -- a fact Republicans have tried to use to their advantage.\u00a0 Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION.  It has been a dramatic week of denials after a bombshell book detailing White House chaos by legendary Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward. And a damning op-ed in the New York Times written by an anonymous administration official. It sent the President into a furious frenzy.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If the failing New York Times has an anonymous editorial--can you believe it? Anonymous, meaning gutless. A gutless editorial. We're doing a great job.  The book is a work of fiction. If you look back at Woodward's past he had the same problem with other presidents.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But are the leaks and allegations that paint a picture of a staff trying to protect the country from the President accurate? We asked Vice President Mike Pence.  MIKE PENCE: The only thing that's wrong about that narrative is everything. Because it-- it shows-- it shows a complete misunderstanding of how this White House works.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Who wrote it? It's the biggest mystery in Washington since Watergate's Deep Throat. The President called for an investigation by his Justice Department.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would say Jeff should be investigating who the author of that piece was, because I really believe it's national security.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it an issue of national security? We'll ask the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia's Mark Warner. And in, yet, another never-before occurrence a former President vented his frustration at the way the current occupant of the White House is running the country.  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It's not conservative. It sure isn't normal. It's radical. It's a vision that says the protection of our power and those who back us is all that matters even when it hurts the country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk about what all of this means for the midterm elections with the two party chairs, Democrat Tom Perez and Republican Ronna McDaniel.  Plus, as football season begins and Colin Kaepernick makes headlines again Mark Leibovich of New York Times joins our panel to talk about his new book on the future of the game.  All of that, and plenty of political analysis coming up on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. At the end of an explosive week in the Trump administration we spoke with Vice President Mike Pence at his home on the grounds of the Naval Observatory here in Washington. We began by asking him about the New York Times op-ed and the more than two dozen high-ranking Trump administration officials who have denied writing it.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: In the past--  MIKE PENCE: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --respectfully, I mean, you suffered, when you were lied to by Michael Flynn. I mean, he was fired for lying to you. What-- do you believe the denials this time?  MIKE PENCE: I do, because I know the men and women who serve with us in this cabinet. But I also do because whoever wrote that editorial, and the narrative that comes out of some other writings recently, just doesn't know what really happens in this White House. I've seen this President in action. Is he demanding? Yes. Is he a strong leader who expects things done yesterday? Yes. But-- but for someone to say that-- that what we've accomplished in the last eighteen months is in spite of this President's leadership, it just reflects an ignorance about-- about President Trump and about our administration.  MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the claims made in the op-ed is that there had been discussion of invoking the 25th Amendment to even remove the President from office. Have you ever been part of a conversation about that?  MIKE PENCE: No. Never. And why-- why would we be, Margaret? I mean, the-- the truth of the matter is over the last eight years despite what we heard from President Obama on Friday.  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: And by the time I left office, household income was near its all-time high, and the uninsured rate had hit an all-time low, and wages were rising, and poverty rates were falling. I mention all this just so when you hear how great the economy is doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started.  MIKE PENCE: I mean this-- this country was struggling. I mean, it was the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression because having inherited a recession, President Obama's answer was to raise taxes, to double the national debt, to increase regulation, to pass Obamacare into law, to stifle American energy.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But he says the economic upswing began on his watch.  MIKE PENCE: Well, I know he said that but I don't think too many Americans noticed it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You said that there are other writings that-- that you also think are inaccurate here. Bob Woodward had this book that just is about to come out describing in detail a number of incidents inside the White House where he, basically, describes people around the President trying to protect the country from him. What is it that you think is inaccurate in his description?  MIKE PENCE: Well, the only thing that's wrong about that narrative is everything because it-- it shows-- it-- it shows a-- a complete misunderstanding of how this White House works, and what-- what President Trump provides for this country every day is strong and decisive leadership in the Oval Office. The narrative that I have picked up, in-- in not only this book but the opinion editorial is suggests that-- that-- that things are happening in spite of the President's leadership, and nothing could be further from the truth. I mean our founders envisioned all executive power be invested in the President of the United States, and the American people should know all the progress that we're making is a result of the fact that President Trump engages in debate, he gets all of the facts and he's not afraid to make a decision and move forward.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Woodward says he has-- he spoke to a hundred people. He has recordings. He has notes to back up these first-hand accounts. I mean, one of the instances was he said that the President was stopped from tweeting about withdrawing U.S. personnel from South Korea because North Korea would view it as an act of war. These are specific instances. You're saying they didn't happen?  MIKE PENCE: What that suggests, and-- and what I-- what I get from other examples and narratives is-- is that-- that-- that people are-- are managing the President, when, in fact, what happens in the White House every day, Margaret, is the President invites opinions. He tends to put people around the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office who have diverse views. And-- and-- and he invites a vigorous debate over what policies ought to be embraced. Then he makes a decision and we go forward whether it's foreign policy, domestic policy, or whether it's legislation on Capitol Hill.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think he respects those advisers?  MIKE PENCE: And that's exactly the kind of-- that's exactly the kind of leadership the American people wanted when they elected President Donald Trump.  MARGARET BRENNAN Some of the instances here are really specific. The President publicly has mocked Jeff Sessions, but in this book, these are specific instances of disregarding the commerce secretary to his face, insulting other cabinet officials. Do you dispute all of these examples?  MIKE PENCE: Well, I-- I would tell you I know this President has great respect for the men and women who serve in this cabinet. And these-- these accounts are very foreign to me. And-- and I-- I-- I'm just not aware of instances where they've occurred and/or where they would occur. But, look, I-- I- I want to stipulate that working in the White House is not for everybody.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Hmm.  MIKE PENCE: I mean this President is tough. He's demanding. He wants things yesterday. And I think it's one of the reasons why we've accomplished so much in such a short period of time. I mean, the truth is I-- I think President Donald Trump is the most accomplished President of my lifetime and I think already one of the most successful Presidents in American history--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think--   MIKE PENCE: --in our first two years.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --people should be fired because of this?  MIKE PENCE: Well, I-- I truly believe that-- that whoever penned this opinion editorial should do the honorable thing and resign. I mean the truth of the matter is that the-- the-- the opinions that they expressed are not only deceitful and false but they're also un-American and they represent an assault on our democracy.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The President has made clear though that he doesn't agree with his attorney general on a number of things. And earlier this week he suggested that Jeff Sessions should not have brought charges against two Republican lawmakers who were running for re-election because he thought it could jeopardize the party's control of Congress. I mean, this suggests that the Justice Department should be taking politics and making it a priority. Do you agree with that?  MIKE PENCE: Well, I think one of-- well, I think there are guidelines in the Department of Justice about not making decisions or taking action that may impact elections, and that's longstanding through numerous administrations. But, look, I think one of the things the American people--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- so Jeff Sessions, you agree, was--  MIKE PENCE: Well-- what I want to say, Margaret, is--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --correct in his actions?  MIKE PENCE: --what-- what the American people appreciate is this-- this President says what he thinks. He lets people know what he feels about things, but and-- and-- and really in a very real sense, what you see is what you get with President Donald Trump. And I think that's the reason why he's made the connection that he's made with people all across this country because--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But on something of-- of that--  MIKE PENCE: --while Washington, DC-- while Washington, DC, focuses on--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --when it has to do with a legal matter people argue that--  MIKE PENCE: --these various controversies--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --that's dangerous--  MIKE PENCE: --he's focused on their interests.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --that-- that may be frank. That may be what he thinks, but that there's a danger to saying things like that because it suggests that rule of law should be-- should be sublimated to politics.  MIKE PENCE: No. This-- this is a President who has strongly affirmed our commitment to the rule of law and to the-- to our justice system. I think you-- you need look no further than-- than the-- the hearings this week with Judge Kavanaugh to hear his strong affirmation of an independent judiciary. This President has reflected that throughout the policies of this administration. But-- but, look, he-- he is always going to be transparent about how he feels about things. And-- and, as I said, there's longstanding Department of Justice guidelines that have to do with making sure that actions are not taken that-- that-- that inadvertently impact the electoral process. But all of that being said, I-- I really do believe the President's candor is one of the reasons why the American people appreciate him.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What are your plans to sit for an interview with Special Counsel Robert Mueller?  MIKE PENCE: You know we've fully cooperated over the last year--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Has he asked for an interview with you yet?  MIKE PENCE: --with the Mueller investigation. He has not. Although we've provided any and all information and we'll continue to do that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'd be willing to sit with him if he were to ask?  MIKE PENCE: I would. I would be more than willing to continue to provide any and all support in that. And we have outside counsel that will advise me accordingly. But I just have to tell you, Margaret, it's just not been my focus and it's not the President's focus. I mean the reason why we're making the progress that we're making all across this country, rebuilding our military, restoring American strength in the world, seeing the opportunity for peace emerge on the Korean Peninsula. I mean-- we-- we're hearing-- we're expecting a letter as we speak from Kim Jong-un communicating again as he did last week his-- his reaffirmation of his commitment to denuclearization. No more nuclear tests. No more missile tests. Our hostages are home. And I had the privilege of being there when the remains of fifty-five fallen Americans in the Korean War were returned to American soil--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think the diplomacy is stalled--  MIKE PENCE: --that's all the result of the President's leadership.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --even though the Secretary of State called off his visit?  MIKE PENCE: Well, I-- I actually believe that when the President canceled the meeting a week ago because he wasn't seeing enough progress in denuclearization that that may well have resulted in what Kim Jong-un communicated to a South Korean envoy just last week, and we're anticipating the letter from Kim Jong-un and all the while our sanctions remain in place.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And do you think you need to cast the deciding vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh?  MIKE PENCE: Well, we hope not. I think the-- I think what the American people--  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not sure where you are on vote count yet?  MIKE PENCE: I-- we'll see where we are. But I-- I have to tell you that despite the embarrassing display by many Senate Democrats in the Judiciary Committee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh showed the intellect, the temperament, the judicial philosophy that I-- I believe should generate broad-based support in the United States Senate. And we have every confidence that Judge Brett Kavanaugh will very soon be Justice Brett Kavanaugh and take a seat on the Supreme Court.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the challenges of television interviews is going back and clarifying your words after the cameras have been turned off. We experienced that in our interview with the vice president Saturday. Here's what we asked at the beginning of the interview about who wrote the anonymous op-ed.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you don't think anyone on your staff--since they're calling themself a Trump appointee had anything to do with this?  MIKE PENCE: I-- I just-- I wouldn't know. And I would-- I really would hope not. And I was-- I was heartened to see so many of our colleagues make it very clear that they weren't involved in this in any way. Look, I-- I can tell you serving alongside this President is-- is an incredible privilege for me and I know it is for-- for every member of our cabinet and all the senior personnel in our administration. I mean this is a-- this is a President who, literally, gets up every day and works to keep the promises that we made to the American people and when you look at the record of success over the last eighteen months it's truly been remarkable.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: After the interview, the vice president told us he had misunderstood the question and asked if he could clarify. So, we turned the cameras back on.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Vice President, I-- I asked you earlier if anyone on your staff wrote this op-ed. Have you asked your staff?  MIKE PENCE: Oh, well, I-- I thought you were speaking about the administration staff. Let me be very clear, I'm one hundred percent confident that no one on the vice president's staff was involved in this anonymous editorial. I-- I know my people, Margaret. They get up every day and are dedicated, just as much as I am, to advancing the President's agenda and supporting everything that President Trump is doing for the people of this country so.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you asked them?  MIKE PENCE: Well, you know-- you know, honestly, I don't have to ask them because I know them. I know their character. I know their dedication and I am absolutely confident that no one on the vice president's staff had anything to do with this. But that being said, you know, who-- whoever this was they should do the honorable thing and resign.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in one minute with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner who joins us today from one of my favorite cities Charlottesville, Virginia. Senator, thank you for coming on FACE THE NATION. We spoke with Vice President Mike Pence--  SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia/@MarkWarner): Thank you, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --Mike Pence who said that he has not been asked by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for an interview but that he would be willing to sit for one and help with that investigation. What do you make of that?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, it seems to me that pence-- Mister Pence is doing the appropriate activity. There is an ongoing investigation that's had now I believe six guilty pleas over thirty indictments. Guilty pleas have included the President's campaign manager, the President's lawyer. The President's CFO has at least got an immunity and Mister Papadopoulos, one of the President's foreign policy aides during the campaign, clearly, indicated that he had been offered dirt on Hillary Clinton and Clinton e-mail. So, there was outreach from-- from the Trump- from the Russians to the Trump operation. So, the fact that Vice President Pence is cooperating is great. I wish his boss Mister Trump would have the same level of cooperation. Donald Trump continues to say he's done nothing wrong then he should sit-- sit down and talk to the Mueller investigation.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any questions for the vice president about what he may have known about what happened in 2016?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: I'm not going to go through where we are at this point in our Intelligence Committee investigation. We have had interviewed over a hundred folks we've still got folks like Mister Papadopoulos and we'd love to get back Mister Cohen that we want to pursue. But I do think the main activity and, clearly, Mister Mueller has a lot more tools in his tool chest than we have at the Senate Intelligence Committee.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, still no date in terms of when you might get George Papadopoulos the former foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign to-- to sit and answer questions with you and-- and do you intend to go back to the attorney general to ask why he gave very different testimony than George Papadopoulos has about conversations regarding setting up a meeting with Vladimir Putin.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think that's something I am-- that I would imagine the Mueller investigation is looking into. We do want to see Papadopoulos. We also want to see Michael Cohen who has indicated that he would come back without any immunity and testify before our committee and our committee is the last bipartisan efforts that's trying to pursue these facts. And if you-- but if you step back from it and you look at all of the guilty pleas that Mueller has received and the total number of indictments the fact that this President still undermines the Mueller investigation. This President who this week is out you know, basically, calling into question somebody who wrote a memo about the activities or an op-ed--the activities inside the White House, a President who is basically asking the Justice Department to back off on criminal indictments of Republican members. This is not a President who understands how our system of laws and rule of law works. And that really bothers me and one of the reasons why I again I hope Mueller gets to the bottom of this.  MARGARET BRENNAN: It doesn't sound like you're going to issue the Senate report before the November midterm races.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think we'll be hard pressed. What we have-- we had four pieces of our investigation before we got to collusion. The first which was reconfirming the intelligence community assessment that the Russians intervened to help Trump hurt Clinton. Second, election security and we've got bipartisan election security legislation that I wish the Senate would take up and pass. Unfortunately, Majority Leader McConnell has held off on allowing us to vote on that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: The third is and we will be fairly harsh on some of the activities from the Obama administration and the FBI. And then we've also-- and just this past week we had another hearing on social media where again we're trying to look not only at what happened in 2016 but on a going forward basis and we made a lot of progress with at least Facebook and Twitter in terms of policy issues we-- we can pursue. Then we've got this final issue, obviously, of collusion.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you see any national security concerns that would justify the President's call for the attorney general to look into who authored this anonymous op-ed by someone claiming to work within the administration?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, I wish that whoever had written the op-ed would have revealed their identity, but I see absolutely no national security issues. I-- I wonder when the Woodward-- Woodward book comes out, and my understanding he has-- he has documented interviews with over a hundred folks in the White House, where this President is going to try to sic the Justice Department on all the folks who talked-- talked to Bob Woodward. This is clearly a President that is a White House that's in chaos and a President that becoming more and more untethered. And if you just step back for a moment and look at the last three months we have had a President who had this disastrous policy with separating kids and families at the border.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: We had the President who had a-- a frankly, I think, unpresidential appearance with Vladimir Putin. A president who zigged and zagged on tariffs. These efforts around his senior officials who pled guilty. His, you know, frankly, unseemly behavior towards John McCain. And now, this reactions to the-- both the book and the op-ed it appears that the walls are closing in on this President and he's lashing out at--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Secretary Mattis and Chief of Staff John Kelly have put on the record denials of some of the reporting from Bob Woodward out there. Do-- do you take them at their word?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I know that Bob Woodward has done this a number of times to presidents of both parties. And, usually, he's been a pretty good journalist, but I'll let Mister Woodward, and I have a great, great deal of respect for Secretary Mattis, let them litigate that out.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Pence in our interview also said that the President was just speaking his mind and being candid, it was candor this week when he said that two Republican congressmen who have been indicted shouldn't have been, essentially, ahead of the midterm races. Does that trouble you those kind of statements or do you just brush this off as more, as the Vice President characterized it, candor?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I think this is why this is a White House in chaos, because most responsible people in the White House realize the President of the United States can't make these comments without consequences. And this President is so irresponsible and I don't think we can continue to excuse his behavior as anything resem-- resembling normalcy. So, it'll be interesting to see whether my colleagues are willing to stand up and call out these activities. I think very shortly, as the Mueller probe continues, we're all going to be at that moment where history will judge us. And I think this President will be judged as well.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Warner, thank you for joining us on FACE THE NATION.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay with us for more FACE THE NATION.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up in a moment, it is President Trump versus President Obama. Will the two stars of the campaign trail energize or antagonize voters? We'll speak with the heads of the Democratic and Republican National Committees about their strategies to win control of Congress with just fifty-eight days left until the midterm races. That's just ahead on FACE THE NATION.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including our political panel after a very wild week in Washington. And I know we say that a lot, we have got a lot to talk about. So be sure to stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. As this year's midterm election campaign kicks into high gear we wanted to sit down with the chairs of both the Republican and Democratic Parties. And we begin our conversation with Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC. You got fifty-eight days to go. A lot of work Democrats needs to pick up--  TOM PEREZ (Democratic National Committee Chair/@TomPerez): Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --roughly about two dozen seats or so to win a majority in the House. When we look at our CBS polling it shows  TOM PEREZ: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --a blue wave is far from guaranteed.  TOM PEREZ: Well, progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability, Margaret. And we're working our tails off everywhere. I feel excited because we're organizing everywhere we're fielding great candidates everywhere. You see the energy out there. Democratic turnout in the primaries in 2018 has been up eighty-four percent from 2014--  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the enthusiasm you're talking about.  TOM PEREZ: --and so you see that out there. That's the enthusiasm. And-- and people are enthusiastic because we're fighting for the issues they care about. People's health care is on the ballot. This is the most important election of our lifetime. Your health care is on the ballot--if you have a preexisting condition. That's on the ballot. Good wages are on the ballot. Education is on the ballot. And, frankly, our democracy is on the ballot because this is not simply an election about right versus left. This is an election about right versus wrong. I worked at DOJ for thirteen years. A president does not tell the Justice Department who and who not to prosecute. That is wrong. The-- the President of the United States should not believe the former chief of the KGB over our intelligence community. We shouldn't rip children from parents. This is about all those critical issues of health care. But it's also about who we are as a nation. Our democracy is on the ballot--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to put President Trump on the ballot then?  TOM PEREZ: Well, we're fighting for all the things that Democrats care about and that includes our democracy. And this President has undermined basic principles of our democracy. Presidents should unite they shouldn't divide.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you mention President Trump himself I mean this is one of the-- the questions here. You know, are you antagonizing or energizing voters when you put not just President Trump, but President Obama, who was out on the campaign trail this week and broke precedent. The White House hit him for that for invoking President Trump's name. This is sort of one of those unwritten rules that you don't slam your successor. Is this a risky strategy to be engaging like that?  TOM PEREZ: Oh, I welcome President Obama on the-- on the campaign trail because he is fighting for the issues that people care about.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But attacking President Trump by name.  TOM PEREZ: Well, our health care is on the ballot and our democracy, as we know it, is on the ballot. You-- you look at what's gone on in this country and-- and you-- you see a president that again I worked under Republican and Democratic presidents at the Justice Department. You see the unmitigated attacks, the attempts to delegitimize the press, the attempts to do things that should never be done. I thought Canada was our ally and--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm.  TOM PEREZ: --and it appears that they are our-- our fiercest adversary. The world is upside down and our democracy is, indeed, on the ballot in what we're doing is we're fighting for health care we're fighting to make sure that if you have a preexisting condition you can retain your health care coverage. We're fighting to make sure that a union-- a worker can join a union and organize and get good wages. Those are the things we're fighting for and that's what Americans want in their leadership.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You have the challenge of messaging against what are positive economic indicators right now. And when you look at CBS polling in the competitive districts that really matter for you to flip the majority of Americans feel positively about the economic direction of the country either going from very good twenty-six percent to somewhat good forty-five percent. How do you push back against that? Isn't what happens at someone's kitchen table going to dominate how they vote?  TOM PEREZ: Oh, it's very important. And-- and if you are very, very wealthy in this country, the economy is doing great. But if you're everybody else, the economy's not doing so great. Corporate profits are soaring and wages are flat. People's health care is at risk because the President has destabilized the Affordable Care Act. The cost of prescription drugs are skyrocketing. So if you have a dollar more in your pocket, but the gas-- gasoline is gone up fifty cents, and your cost of prescription drugs have gone up immensely because they're not taking on the industry, and your cost of health care has gone up, you're not-- you're not even treading water. And that's the reality for millions of people, including the Harley workers in-- in Missouri who are about to lose their job.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Wages did go up in August at the fastest pace since the recession, but I do want to ask you about the direction of the party in terms of identity. You have said Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been this sort of rock star in many ways since she won in New York a few months ago, you've called her the-- the future of the party. Is that a sign that more people within the Democratic Party need to tack left. Is that the identity to go more progressive?  TOM PEREZ: What I have said is Connor Lamb is the future of the party. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the future of the party. Doug Jones is the future of the party. We have a party that reflects America in every zip code. We have a party that's fighting for health care. We have a party that's fighting for fair wages. We have a party that's fighting for a democracy that works for everyone, not just a few at the top. And your question about wages, it's important for your listeners to understand that real wage growth is what it's about.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  TOM PEREZ: If-- if wages go up by a dollar and your cost of living goes up by a dollar fifty, you're not better off. And that's the problem with this economy. If this President would take on the pharmaceutical industry, we could do something about it. If-- and-- and this is indeed. We got fifty-eight days until the weekend and the most important thing we can do is vote. And one of the things we're doing is making sure we get the vote out everywhere. And we're actually working next week to call on businesses to give two hours of paid leave for people so that they can get out their vote.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  TOM PEREZ: I'm-- I'm going to ask Chairman McDaniel--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.  TOM PEREZ: --to join us in that because we should have this debate and then we should-- we should make sure that every eligible person--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Point taken.  TOM PEREZ: --can get out there and vote.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We got to leave it there. Thank you very much and we'll bring out here Republican Chair Ronna McDaniel next.  TOM PEREZ: Always a pleasure.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back with the head of the Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel. Welcome to FACE THE NATION.  RONNA MCDANIEL (Republican National Committee Chair/@GOPChairwoman): Thanks for having me. Great to be here.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to be with you. And I know yesterday you were New York.  RONNA MCDANIEL: Correct.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I had to ask you about this. You were alongside OMB Director Mick Mulvaney when he was caught on tape, obtained by The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, saying, \"You may hate the President, and there's a lot of people who do, but they certainly like the way the country's going... And when it comes to voters, you may have to subtract from the equation how they feel about the President and then the numbers go up dramatically.\" Do you think Republicans would fare better if President Trump was not so dominant in this race?  RONNA MCDANIEL: The President has a ninety percent approval rating among Republicans. It's one of the highest in history for a President from his own party. And we have seen on the ground as we bring the President into these races, like Montana, where he was this week, the candidates' numbers rise. We saw it with Matt Rosendale. We saw in Ohio when Balderson was in a very tough race. We brought the President into Delaware County and we saw him help propel that Election Day vote to victory. So the President is a great asset for us. And, remember, in the midterms, it's the party that's turning out their base. We have to turn out our base first. And with the President with this type of approval rating and with these results, with a 3.9 percent unemployment with four million job-- jobs coming back to this country, all the good things that people are feeling, as you mentioned earlier, wage increases of 2.9 percent. People are feeling good about where they are. And the President is a great asset for us.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So is Mick Mulvaney flat out wrong?  RONNA MCDANIEL: I didn't hear him say that. I was there. You know, he-- he was talking about the President being a decisive leader, he talked about his memory. He talked about working for him. I think he was just making the point that, maybe if you don't like a candidate, or you-- you don't necessarily agree with them on everything, the results, in this instance, speak for themselves. And that you can't deny. And Democrats are going to try and make it about the President; they're going to try and make it about personality. But the results don't lie coming out of this administration. We are a better country. We are better off than we were two years ago. And everyone around the country is feeling that and that is because of this President.  MARGARET BRENNAN: There was a recording that The Journal and The New York Times both had there also saying that Mick Mulvaney said there's a very real possibility that Senator Ted Cruz may lose his race in Texas.  RONNA MCDANIEL: Yeah. He did-- he said--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to lose Texas?  RONNA MCDANIEL: No. He said it's important to be likeable.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard him say that?  RONNA MCDANIEL: We're not going to lose Texas. Yeah. He said it's important to be likable I'm going to make this point. I don't think it's likely. You could have Texas; you could have Florida in the play. He was talking to the candidates we had in the room about the importance about-- of being likable. That is important. But we are not going to lose Texas. Anybody who watched Ted Cruz this week, in these judiciary hearings with Judge Kavanaugh hearing him talk about the importance of rule of law, hearing him talk about the importance of what Judge Kavanaugh would bring to the bench caring about the Constitution knows that Ted Cruz is an excellent representative for Texas and he is going to win that seat.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And likable?  RONNA MCDANIEL: And likeable. I think he's very likeable.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I am just kidding. And, typically, when we look at midterm races, the President's party often loses seats. I mean you've got some exceptions, '98, 2002. Will Republicans be able to hold control of the House? How certain are you?  RONNA MCDANIEL: So, first of all, we know the historical trends, thirty seats lost in that first midterm when you hold the White House. Obama lost sixty seats. And, usually, you-- you lose seats in the Senate, too. So the Senate map we are talking about picking up seats which is unprecedented in a midterm of a first-term President. So that's something that everyone should be looking at. One, to see if we pick up one seat that will be defying history--  MARGARET BRENNAN: On the House?  RONNA MCDANIEL: --on the House. We have a lot of seats and the margin. Absolutely, we've had an unprecedented amount of retirements and that has made it harder in some of these swing districts. But right now, I'd say it's fifty-fifty. We are out every day working. The RNC has raised to date, two hundred and fifty million dollars. We've put four hundred and fifty-- five hundred and forty-nine staff on the ground. We've trained twenty thousand field org-- organizers. That's four times more than we did in 2016. So our infrastructure to turn out our vote, to engage with our voters, to talk to them about these results is the best it has ever been in the midterms. Now, candidates matter. And that's going to be different in every single race. And we need these candidates to talk about their local issues, go out there. They have to work as hard as they've ever worked. Candidates who think that they're in safe districts, they're going to have to give everything and we're going to be there backing it up at the RNC.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you said it's going to come down to the base in many ways, but a lot of traditional Republicans are troubled by some of the President's policies particularly on trade, tariffs, going against very traditional conservative values. How do you reconcile that?  RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, first of all, the President has done things that have been traditional Republican policies that we've campaigned on for years: deregulation, cutting taxes, strengthening our military, taking care of our veterans. And a lot of those things have spurred this economic growth, despite what President Obama is trying now to take credit for. But when it comes to the tariffs the President has said he is for free trade. You saw that when he talked to the President of the European Union. He has said, \"We don't want tariffs at all.\" But when we are in a position of a power-- of power, as our country is economically, and we are on the rise, he is going to say to countries like China, \"You are not going to take advantage of the United States anymore.\" And he is negotiating from a physician of strength. Because when we're not in this position, we won't be able to fight the five-hundred-billion-dollar deficit that we continually deal.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The pain is tolerable for now?  RONNA MCDANIEL: He's making progress and he's fighting for Americans and he's fighting for American jobs, and that's why he's so popular in my state of Michigan. I see it all over the country. People who were forgotten under the last administration--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  RONNA MCDANIEL: --feel like they have a President who is listening and caring about them. And the proof is in the results.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Ronna, thank you very much.  RONNA MCDANIEL: Thank you so much.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment with our panel.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with our panel. Amy Walter is National Editor of the Cook Political Report and co-host of WNYC's The Takeaway. David Nakamura covers the White House for the Washington Post. Mark Leibovich is Chief National Correspondent for the New York Times magazine and is out with a brand new book, \"Big Game: The NFL in Dangerous Times.\" And Rachael Bade covers Congress for Politico. She is also a CNN political analyst. Rachael, I'll start off with you. We were just forecasting the races here. Is Ted Cruz going to win in Texas? Are these seats something that you heard both party leaders predict accurately?  RACHAEL BADE (Politico/@rachaelmbade): You know, it's Texas, come on. Ted Cruz is likely going to win, of course. But this shows the energy on the left right now and that is Democrats are turning out. They're-- they're energized and they could really pose a threat particularly in the House, though. And I think it was interesting, you know, McDaniel mentioned fifty-fifty and that she thought, you know, it's about fifty-fifty chance they keep the House. I-- from Capitol Hill, I've heard a little bit of a change in tone in past couple of weeks where some Republicans actually think the House is gone. And a lot of it has to do with the noise that's going on. You know, they have a story to tell, there was a great jobs report that came out Friday, record wage increases since 2009 and they want to talk about the economy. But everyone right now is focused on what's going on, the drama, the scandal in the White House, the President hitting back, the Russia investigation, and that is really drowning out the Republican message right now and it's a big problem for them.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Amy, is-- is that also what you're seeing?  AMY WALTER (Cook Political Report/@amyewalter): Yeah. You know, the energy is-- is really the key part of this. The President is very good at ginning up his base and going out and making sure that as the RNC chairwoman said he's got an eighty-eight, ninety percent approval rating with his party. But when he fires up his base, he fires up the other side. And in fact fires them up almost to a degree that-- actually not almost-- to a degree that's larger than the people who like him. When you look at the approval rating of the President, those who say they strongly disapprove him have consistently been bigger than the people who strongly approve of him. So the intensity on the other side is really the big challenge for-- for the Republicans.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is putting-- is putting President Obama on the campaign trail a good strategy?  AMY WALTER: You know, the strategy of putting the President on the trail to help get those people who traditionally don't turn out in midterm elections, especially young people to come out and vote for Democrats. That turns what is right now building as a wave for Democrats. If young people also turn out, that's a tsunami. The other thing that I think is fascinating about watching this President with President Obama, both of them are trying to do the thing that is very difficult for presidents to do in a midterm, which is to say I want that coalition that turned out for me in the presidential year. In Obama's case, young people, people of color. In Trump's case, the rural, small town America. I know you came out and voted for me but now you've got to come out and vote for these members of Congress, right? It-- it's a sign that you respect me if you come and vote in the midterms. It's a very difficult thing to do, especially since Trump got elected in many ways by running against the very people that he's saying please now vote for to come back to office.  DAVID NAKAMURA (The Washington Post/@DavidNakamura): You even saw it in Trump's rally in Montana just this past week where one of his arguments is now vote for Republican members in Congress or else I face impeachment. And, yes, he sort of means-- he sort of means, yes, okay, some of the progress we've made on the economy, and I think-- but really it's about him.  MARK LEIBOVICH (The New York Times Magazine/@MarkLeibovich): I mean, I do think there are two points. One is-- I mean, we've seen over and over again in these-- these special elections that support for President Trump doesn't necessarily translate into turnout for Republicans down the ballot. But also, I mean, yes, his support among Republicans is sky high. But the Republican Party has shrunk considerably since he has taken office. I mean, these numbers-- I mean, many of them are in that fifty-five, sixty percent range of disapproval are some of the them are coming from former Republicans who are no longer reflected in that sample. So I think it's an interesting, I mean, especially for a general election campaign I think that's probably the more, you know, prominent number.  AMY WALTER: Yeah. And the more-- and the real fascinating thing about this campaign is the race for the Senate and the House are taking place in two very different Americas.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Mm.  AMY WALTER: The race for the Senate is through red, rural America in states like Montana, North Dakota, and West Virginia. The battle for the House runs through suburban America. And in one part of America they really like Trump, in the other part they really don't.  DAVID NAKAMURA: And that's where he's been campaigning right now--  AMY WALTER: That's right.  DAVID NAKAMURA: --this North Dakota and Montana just this past week.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, I want to ask you, you know, to Rachael's point some of the scandal in Washington sometimes overshadows the messaging that the parties would rather have heard. With the decision for the vice president, for cabinet members to come out this week against an anonymous self-described Trump administration official and Bob Woodward. Did they elevate the story and make the problem bigger or did they help themselves by engaging like this?  MARK LEIBOVICH: I-- I think they elevated it. I don't think there's any question they elevated it. Because, first of all, the number of days between now and the election in which, you know, the core story about the economy which is what Republicans clearly want to be talking about is not being told. I mean, that was-- this is another basically wasted week, if you want to keep it neutral here. So, no, I mean, I don't know if they could have ignored it. I mean, I don't know if they had a choice here. But we do-- we've seen over and over again that this White House has a knack for drumming up news that has nothing to do with the economy, nothing to do with things that Republicans who rather they talk about.   RACHAEL BADE: Speaking of that op-ed, it feels like at least Republicans on Capitol Hill feel like this was totally counterproductive. You know, they have been trying to bring the President to their side on things like averting a shut down right before the election, striking trade deals not blowing up NAFTA completely. Russia, NATO and right now the President has a reason to be paranoid at least, you know, that's what he's telling himself is people in his administration who are writing these op-eds saying that they are trying to basically reign him in, he's not going to trust anyone. So this is counterproductive for Republicans and have the big problem for them.  DAVID NAKAMURA: It's-- it's survival instincts for his aides to come out and say that. The President does want them to come out fighting on his behalf.  RACHAEL BADE: Right.  DAVID NAKAMURA: He himself is the one who escalates these controversies the most dramatically. And he did it again this week on Twitter, public statements on Air Force One in the middle of his campaign trip, talking about his own competence saying, you know, he can speak for-- for-- for-- for hours without notes to say how competent he is. I mean, he's trying to defend himself and he wants to see his aides out there doing the same thing.  MARGARET BRENNAN: David, you had some unusual warnings from the White House, the State Department and elsewhere about what would happen in Syria if you saw this offensive in Idlib, we know the bombing is underway. It seems those warnings are being dismissed by Russia and the Assad regime. What is happening here? Why aren't the Trump warnings being heeded?  DAVID NAKAMURA: Yes. Well, I mean, the President has sort of signaled both ways on Syria in his time. And, you know, I think that he's someone who said that he wanted to withdraw, he's also said someone who sent missiles into Syria. I think, you know, he's now-- there's now reports that said he's committed now to a longer term strategy and it's not going to be simple. So, you know, his relationship with the malign actors in that country have not-- he hasn't been that-- that clear with exactly what he's demanding.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And what should we read into the fact that in North Korea during the military parades today they didn't include intercontinental ballistic missiles. Are we over reading the pageantry or is it significant--  DAVID NAKAMURA: I think you're seeing a sign probably from Kim Jong-un. I mean, he was there with a top level Chinese official that's already frustrating the White House, China's role with North Korea maybe not putting as much pressure on them as he'd like to get serious about denuclearization. But I think Kim Jong-un is reading the signs that President Trump cancelled the trip of his secretary of state to Pyongyang saying there's not enough progress. They don't want to inflame him unnecessarily. So I think it is a sign that Kim is trying to put these things back on track. However, I think analysts are right to say that we haven't seen any real progress on the denuclearization and the more time goes by, U.S. intelligence agencies are saying North Korea is not denuclearizing. They're not ramping it down. In fact, behind the scenes, they're taking efforts to conceal what they have and continue to move forward with the program.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, you just wrote this book about the NFL.  MARK LEIBOVICH: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Going from-- from one swamp to the other.  MARK LEIBOVICH: Yes, exactly.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You compare them--  MARK LEIBOVICH: Trading swamps.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --in-- in the book. But this week just even this morning you have President Trump tweeting about football. Why is this such a useful political tool for him?  MARK LEIBOVICH: Well, I mean, the-- the-- there's the old saying that football, the NFL owns the day of the week, that would be Sunday, right? And what I found initially just from running, again, trading swamps as you said is that politics keeps infringing this week being a perfect object lesson of my football book is out and we're talking about politics. President Trump obviously loves this issue. He has, you know, a lot of personal resentment towards the NFL. He thinks--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?  MARK LEIBOVICH: Because he's wanted to own a team for about four decades and the most exclusive club, Billionaire Boys Club, the NFL owners want no part of him and has no objective--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So for-- for you that's what it is, it's not about patriotism and the anthem and the antagonism--  MARK LEIBOVICH: It-- it's that, too. It is absolutely that, too. I mean, my book, I wanted to, like, look into like what that world looks like. It's a very mysterious world. I don't think most people know what goes into running the National Football League. In Mister-- in President Trump's case, this is a culture war grenade. He feels that this is a winning issue, the protests are something that he feels the polls are on his side with which it would seem he is, that-- that it is. And he also gets to be in the middle of the great spectacle of American life which is football and politics at the same time.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Nike also thought it was a winning issue apparently.  MARK LEIBOVICH: Apparently-- no. I mean, what Nike has done and what Donald Trump has done and what Colin Kaepernick have done is they-- they have sort of filled the vacuum of leadership inside the NFL. And the NFL has just basically chosen to punt-- I didn't even do that on purpose. Totally didn't do that on purpose. On this issue, they-- they really-- they're still kind of doddering around. No one knows what to do. There's no policy. And so you have these other entities filling the vacuum.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Rachael, who was the 2020 candidate trying out in these Kavanaugh hearings this week?  RACHAEL BADE: Who? Which one? You know, yes, the focus was supposed to be on Kavanaugh, became on audition for 2020, you had Kamala Harris from California potentially running in 2020. She waited about ten seconds to interrupt the hearing when they first started, when Grassley basically gaveled them in, saying we can't have this hearing, we don't have all the documents on Kavanaugh. It is not right. We don't know what he's really going to do as a Supreme Court Justice until we get these documents.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Mm.  RACHAEL BADE: That was obviously followed up by Cory Booker, who is also a potential--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  RACHAEL BADE: --candidate in 2020. And his Spartacus moment where he said I'm going to release a whole bunch of confidential information that the Senate panel didn't want to release.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  RACHAEL BADE: Of course, some of those had already been released, so he kind of looked a little silly in that moment.  MARGARET BRENNAN: He's a bit of a--  RACHAEL BADE: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --bit of a kerfuffle.  RACHAEL BADE: But-- but on that, some of them had not--  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're out of time. So I do that to wrap you on that.  RACHAEL BADE: We keep going forever.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We-- we have to wrap you on the filibuster. Well, we'll-- we will be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks for watching. I won't be here next week. I'll be taking some time with a new member of my family. But John Dickerson and the FACE THE NATION team will be here.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Trump sent two tweets Wednesday in support of Rep. Dan Donovan, who is locked in a close GOP primary race with fellow Republican Michael Grimm. Grimm represented the district in Congress from 2010 until he resigned in 2014 after pleading guilty to tax fraud. Mr. Trump wrote that Donovon is \"strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again.\" In the second tweet, Mr. Trump asked supporters to \"remember Alabama,\" when populist Republican Roy Moore won the GOP primary, but then lost the special election to Democrat Doug Jones. Mr. Trump backed Moore's challenger, Luther Strange, in the primary but then backed Moore in the general election, despite allegations that he pursued teenagers when he was in his 30s. There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement! Very importantly, @RepDanDonovan will win for the Republicans in November...and his opponent will not. Remember Alabama. We can\u2019t take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat! New York's 11th District, which encompasses Staten Island and a portion of south Brooklyn, is the only district in New York City with a Republican in Congress. Mr. Trump won the district with 56 percent of the vote, and both Donovan and Grimm have campaigned as candidates in line with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump's attorney, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, endorsed Donovan in April. Donovan participated in a roundtable last month with Mr. Trump and other federal and state officials on Long Island to discuss MS-13. Donovan told local news station Spectrum 1 News after the event that they \"didn't talk about\" an endorsement. Grimm has been endorsed by Mr. Trump's short-lived communications director, Anthony Scaramucci. Scaramucci campaigned with Grimm at an event two weeks ago. Even though Grimm served seven months in prison, he remains popular on Staten Island. He hasn't referenced Mr. Trump's endorsement of his challenger, but he tweeted Wednesday that \"all the endorsements in the world can't change the facts.\" All the endorsements in the world can\u2019t change the facts: Donovan has failed to pass even one substantive bill into law, and has voted against President Trump every time it\u2019s mattered - from failing to repeal Obamacare, to banning sanctuary cities, and even against tax cuts.",

I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION.  The passing of former President George H. W. Bush, who died this Friday at the age of ninety-four, has prompted the nation to pause and reflect on the life of a man who served as our forty-first President. Even the current President put a pause on the news during a meeting of world leaders in Argentina.  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We lost a President who truly was a wonderful person, a wonderful man, a great man, it really puts a damper on it, to be honest with you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll look back at the life and legacy of the man who was our forty- first President and the father of the forty-third. His close friend and former Secretary of State James Baker will be with us as well as former Vice President Dick Cheney who served as President George H. W. Bush's secretary of defense. Plus, we'll look at the news of the week, how will developments in the cases against the President's personal attorney Michael Cohen and Mister Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort affect the Russia investigation. The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee Mark Warner joins us and we'll hear what happened and what didn't at that meeting with world leaders.  It's all ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Tributes and condolences from around the country and around the world are pouring in following the death of George H. W. Bush late Friday at his home in Houston, Texas. On Monday, his body will be flown on Air Force One here to Washington where he will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol. A state funeral at Washington National Cathedral will take place on Wednesday and then he will return to Texas where he will be buried next to his wife, Barbara, and their daughter, Robin. President Trump declared Wednesday a national day of mourning that means the stock market and the federal government will be closed down in honor of the forty-first President.  Joining us now are former FACE THE NATION moderator and now CBS News contributor Bob Schieffer and CBS THIS MORNING co-host Norah O'Donnell. So good to have the both of you here as we look back at the life and legacy of the man that we refer to as forty-one.  BOB SCHIEFFER(CBS News Contributor/@bobschieffer): Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob, I know you have taken a look there at his life.  BOB SCHIEFFER: You know, Margaret, I think it's fair to say that George Herbert Walker Bush did nearly everything you can do in life and in politics in his ninety-four years.  (Begin VT)  BOB SCHIEFFER: As a Navy pilot he was shot down in combat during World War II. He founded a successful business, had six kids, was a congressman, ambassador to the U.N., head of the CIA, and our first envoy to China. And in 1980, he was ready to go for the big prize, the presidency. He got off to a great start, he won the Iowa caucuses. I interviewed him the morning after and, frankly, I couldn't figure out what he was talking about.  PRESIDENT GEORGE H. W. BUSH: We will have forward Big Mo on our side, as they say in athletics.  BOB SCHIEFFER: Big Mo?  PRESIDENT GEORGE H. W. BUSH: Mo, momentum.  BOB SCHIEFFER: Unfortunately, for Bush, Ronald Reagan reorganized his campaign and Bush's Big Mo became little Mo. And Reagan rolled to the nomination. But in a move that surprised everyone he chose Bush as his running mate. Bush became the ideal vice president for eight years doing what vice presidents do. Like a minor character in a play passing across the stage on errands that had little to do with the plot. He ran for President when Reagan left office but his campaign got off to a terrible start. George Bush was a nice man, modest, kind, a man who actually wrote thank-you notes, trouble was some mistook niceness for weakness. The question, are you tough enough was asked of him repeatedly.  PRESIDENT GEORGE H. W. BUSH (FACE THE NATION, 1979): I equate toughness with moral fiber, with character, with principle, with demonstrated leadership in tough jobs where you emerge not bullying somebody, but with the respect of the people you led. That's toughness. That's fiber. That's character. I have got it. And if I happen to be decent in the process, that should not be a liability.  BOB SCHIEFFER: The one-time fighter pilot found himself depicted on the cover of Newsweek magazine as a \"wimp.\" To change his imagine in New Hampshire he traded the coat and tie for a tractor hat and windbreaker and drove every piece of heavy machinery he could find. It worked. He won the Republican nomination and made two promises, first--  PRESIDENT GEORGE H. W. BUSH: Read my lips. No new taxes.  BOB SCHIEFFER: --and the second, an administration based on American value.  PRESIDENT GEORGE H. W. BUSH: I want a kinder and gentler nation.  JUDGE WILLIAM HUBBS REHNQUIST: So help me God.  PRESIDENT GEORGE H. W. BUSH: So help me God.  JUDGE WILLIAM HUBBS REHNQUIST: Congratulations.  PRESIDENT GEORGE H. W. BUSH: Thank you.  BOB SCHIEFFER: Bush beat Michael Dukakis in a landslide. But by that time the world beyond our shores was changing. The Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union was imploding. Because of his temperament and long experience in foreign policy, Bush kept belligerency and boasting down and the situation cool. And in 1990 when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, Bush put together a remarkable multi-nation coalition that drove him back to his own borders. Bush's popularity went through the roof and his reelection was a foregone conclusion. But as the nation's deficit ballooned, he bit the bullet and raised taxes. The move worked and the economy got better, but many Republicans never forgave him for breaking his no new taxes promise. And he lost the '92 election in a three-way race with Ross Perot and Bill Clinton. In time, he saw sons George and Jeb elected to governorships and George as our forty-third President.  (End VT)  BOB SCHIEFFER: George H. W. Bush was perhaps the most modest man ever to hold the presidency. His proudest legacy he always said was that his kids still came home to see him and his greatest achievement was marrying Barbara who died earlier this year after seventy-three years of marriage. Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh. I love that look-back.  NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS THIS MORNING Co-Host/@NorahODonnell): Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Norah, I know that you spent time with H. W.'s son, George W. Bush, our forty-third President, and some of that will be airing tonight on 60 MINUTES. Let's take a look.  (Begin VT)  NORAH O'DONNELL (60 MINUTES): You said that watching his presidency and the criticism that he got as President--  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH (60 MINUTES): Yeah.  NORAH O'DONNELL: --helped you.   PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Yeah. It did. Because, first of all, being the child of a President is unpleasant. I mean you watch somebody you love get lampooned or made fun of, or harshly criticized, it hurts. And so by the time I became President, you know, I had a-- a fair amount of asbestos on my skin. And it didn't hurt nearly as much it turns out, you know.  NORAH O'DONNELL: It's like fire retardant?  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Exactly. Fire retardant, yeah.  NORAH O'DONNELL: Did it bother your father to see you criticized while you were in office?  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Yeah. It did. In the end though, you know, we both knew that's part of the job. I mean which is actually good, you know, for the country. I mean you want your powerful people to be held up to scrutiny.  NORAH O'DONNELL: When you look back at your father's term in office as President--  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Yeah.  NORAH O'DONNELL: --he starts to many people look better and better.  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Yeah. We all do. Yeah. That's the way time works.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Norah, I know you spoke with other former Presidents. I mean so few people can even begin to relate to what it's like to be in the Oval Office.  NORAH O'DONNELL: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you learn from some of these formers?  NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, tonight on 60 MINUTES, you will hear from three former Presidents, a rare occurrence in itself. And from George W. Bush, his son, there is not only a reference for his father. But I think the point he tries to make is that we are mourning something greater than one man in some ways. We are mourning an ideal because President George H. W. Bush was the last of the greatest generation. A man who in every one of his decisions put country above himself. John Mitchum has said that, too, his biographer that in every one of those decisions, he tried-- tried to choose the country first--all of the decision to raise taxes which, ultimately, cost him his own reelection and arguably led to a fracturing of the Republican party that has lasted until today. But in George W. Bush he talks too about the decisions his father made.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  NORAH O'DONNELL: You know, talking about reshaping a global world order as one of the most consequent-- quential Presidents in American history. So-- and there's some fun stories that have never been told before that you'll hear as well tonight.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob, you were telling me something similar to what Norah just picked up on there, that for you, you saw H. W. as a public servant more than a politician per se.  BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, the fact is he was a much better public servant than he was a politician because it was part of his upbringing. His mother had brought him up, saying \"we never brag on our own achievements. That's just something that the Bushes don't do.\" So it was always hard for George H. W. Bush to-- to push his own case because he thought it-- it reflected poorly on him.  NORAH O'DONNELL: He also suffered an enormous loss in his life.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  NORAH O'DONNELL: Multiple occasions, you know, from when he was the youngest pilot in the Navy, he lost his two crew mates, that haunted him for his entire life. He lost his daughter at the age of three, he lost his first two Senate races, he lost a presidency. There are so many losses throughout his life that I think many people can relate to having own loss in their life, but how did he deal with those losses, that resilience also I think shaped in some ways his humility.  NORAH O'DONNELL: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob, you knew the Bush family for decades, what was he like as a person?  BOB SCHIEFFER: He was just a nice person. I mean if-- if you would be around him, he'd tell you, how about a cup of coffee or, you know, I mean he was-- he was just-- just a regular guy.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Didn't take himself seriously.  BOB SCHIEFFER: And-- and his son was very much like him. I-- I was listening to-- to Norah's interview there. You know, Presidents come under fire and when George Bush would come under fire, people say, it's too bad. And-- and-- you know what he always said, he said, nobody asked me to run for office.  NORAH O'DONNELL: Mm-Hm.  BOB SCHIEFFER: I decided to do this. This is part of it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob, Norah, thanks to both of you. We will see you later in the show. And be sure to tune in for tonight's 60 MINUTES for more of Norah's interview with George W. Bush, also here as she said from former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama on George H. W.'s legacy.  We turn now to President George H. W. Bush's longtime friend, his Secretary of State James Baker, who joins us from the Baker Institute in Houston this morning. My condolences, Sir. I know you were dear friends with the former President. And you were with him in those final moments. Knowing him as you did, for so many years, can you tell us what you took away in those last moments? What is left with you in terms of your memory of him?  JAMES BAKER (Former Secretary of State): Well, he was a-- he was a-- he had great faith in God. He was a religious person who didn't wear his religion on his sleeve but he was a man of great faith. He was a family man. He, as one of your-- in your lead-in someone said, one of the things he said he was proudest of was that his children came home and he was proud of that. He was a-- he was a selfless, patriotic servant of the United States of America for many, many years. And he was one who did not believe in taking credit. He was one who believed in letting other people get the credit. He was courageous. Courageous enough to run for President when nobody knew who he was. He was an asterisk in the polls. He jumped into that race in 1980. He ended up beating such a more popular political figures as John Connally and Howard Baker and Bob Dole and others and had to become the last man standing with Ronald Reagan and, therefore, ended up being his vice president. So he was-- he was a man of great capacity. He was a man of great ten-- tenderness and sensitivity. He was, as someone said, the last gentleman that we have had as President.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was it so important to you to be by his side in those last moments?  JAMES BAKER: Well, it was important to me to be by his side because we've been friends for sixty years. That's a fairly long period of time, we-- we were doubles partners together here in Houston, we won tennis championships. I knew him well before he ever even got into politics, when he was a businessman. He was my-- he was my daughter's godfather. I ran every one of his campaigns for President. We were very, very close. He referred to me oftentimes as his best friend. He said our relationship was one of big brother, little brother which was a great honor as far as I was concerned.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Which one were you?  JAMES BAKER: I was the little brother. And I was very, very happy for-- for George H. W. Bush to refer to me as his little brother. And we were extremely close, Margaret, and from-- from the very-- almost from the very time we met back in 1958, for almost sixty years. I was there when he passed. His passing was very, very peaceful, gentle if you will. There were-- there were a number of things that I remember about it not-- the-- he-- the-- the caregivers. I went to see him on Friday morning, I hadn't seen him for a while, he'd had three bad days. I went to check on him after a run and-- and one of the caregivers said, Mister President, Secretary Baker's here, and he looked up at me, opened both eyes looked at me and said, Jim, where are we going? And I said, well, Jefe--because that's what I called him, Jefe, which is Spanish for chief. I said, \"Well, Jefe, we're going to heaven.\" He said, \"That's where I want to go.\" And then as he began to-- to move, to go downhill, they-- they got all of his children on the telephone. Only one of them was able to be with him at the time, his son Neil. They got the others on the telephone and they were all able to tell their father how much they loved him and to say goodbye. And his very last words, the very last words he spoke, were spoken to George W. Bush, President Bush 43, who had told him how much he loved him and that he would see him on the other side. And 41 said, \"I love you, too.\" And that was about forty minutes before he passed away. He kept his sense of humor, Margaret, right up--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  JAMES BAKER: --until the very end. My wife Susan was there with me, and at one point she went over and put her hand on his forehead and she said, \"We love you very much, Jefe.\" And he cocked one eye open and he said, \"Well, you better hurry.\" So-- so, he was-- he was, his sense of humor was intact right up till the very end. His passing was really very peaceful. No struggling, no-- no pain at all.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Secretary Baker, thank you very much for sharing so much of the personal side.  JAMES BAKER: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you were a key part of helping to shape his foreign policy legacy and so much of his time in office. Thank you for sharing all those intimate details.  JAMES BAKER: Thank-- thank you, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with another key official from the Bush administration, his former Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney who is standing by with us. We'll hear from him in just one moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Joining us now is former Vice President Dick Cheney who served as defense secretary to President H. W. Bush. Thank you for being here with us.  DICK CHENEY (Former Vice President): You're welcome.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We just heard so much of-- of who forty-one was as a person--  DICK CHENEY: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --in terms of his legacy for the country he was in office at such a tremendous time of change in the world of upheaval. You were at the Pentagon at that time. How do you think the fact that he was part of that greatest generation, a World War II vet, that he had seen combat, how did all of that come together to inform his role and in shaping foreign policy?  DICK CHENEY: Well, I think the nation was lucky to have him at that particular time, I say he was the last World War II veteran. And well also, there were just remarkable events that took place during those four years when you think about the end of the Cold War, the Soviet Union going out of business. The un-- unification of Germany, the liberation, if you will, of all those former Soviet states in the-- in Eastern Europe. Big, big changes that the situation that existed since the end of World War II and through the Cold War. And, all of a sudden, it ends and he was in exactly the right spot when that happened, especially because he understood that partly what was needed was to manage the U.S. reaction, that there was a way if you-- if you overdid it, if say people were dancing on the Berlin Wall you could get into a situation where you'd make it tougher for Gorbachev to do what we wanted him to do, which was end of the Cold War and the President was masterful shaping that relationship. I know as a secretary of defense my interest, from the secretarial standpoint was I wanted to get military attaches and all of those embassies established and all those former Soviet states. The President made sure we didn't go too fast. He didn't want to be in a position where we were embarrassing, if you will, Gorbachev and that we could wait a few months and some of those cases to get that done. But he was superb and then his leadership in the Gulf War was-- was really remarkable.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I know Secretary Baker has talked about, as President he was able to balance America's national interests--  DICK CHENEY: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --along with our shared values.  DICK CHENEY: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Sometimes those things are described as being in competition with each other.  DICK CHENEY: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you think he was able to balance those and-- and is that something that we've lost?  DICK CHENEY: Well, he had this rare combination. I mean his fifty-eight combat missions in World War II, shot down over the Pacific, rescued by an American submarine, came, obviously, very close to death. And at the same time his tremendous background in diplomacy, the United Nations Ambassador to China. He had a set of relationships, I can remember the first weekend of the Gulf crisis he sent me out to get permission from Saudi Arabia and Egypt for the deployment of U.S. forces.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  DICK CHENEY: I turned around, I'd finished that, headed back and he called me and said, we got to stop in Morocco, because he had just gotten hold of the king of Morocco and wanted me to stop in and brief him and sign the Moroccans up. He was the-- the best desk officer we ever had at the State Department because he knew all these folks.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Very involved in the details.  DICK CHENEY: Mm-Hm. Involved in the details both with the use of the military, as well as in the-- the diplomacy. But on the-- on the military side of it he was-- he was a great boss because he'd basically give you your head, told me to go run the Defense Department, I mean four million people--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  DICK CHENEY: --in defense in those days and--  MARGARET BRENNAN: How different was it, since you have such an unusual experience, of having worked for both forty-one--  DICK CHENEY: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --and forty-three. How different were father and son?  DICK CHENEY: Well, there-- there were differences there, no question about it. But especially there were differences in the time. It was only, you know, eight years apart--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  DICK CHENEY: --from the end of the first Bush administration, beginning to the second. But there had been some remarkable changes during that period of time. One of the things that had happened was 9/11.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  DICK CHENEY: And we'd been hit and lost three thousand Americans on 9/11. That was a-- a big event between--made things different in forty-three's day than what they'd been in forty-one's day.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Did that change your relationship with forty-one?  DICK CHENEY: No, not really. He, at one point, I was accused of becoming--use their phrase--iron ass. He used that language that I'd change from when I was secretary of defense working for him to when I was vice president working for his son. And--  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're smiling at that description.  DICK CHENEY: Well, I can laugh about it. After he'd done it, I got a note from him saying, \"Dear Dick, I did it,\" and then he went on to say nice things about me, but that year when the Alfalfa dinner was held here in Washington--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  DICK CHENEY: --he arranged for me to be-sit right next to him at the head table. I mean he wanted to make sure there was no perpetual aggravation there at all between forty-one and myself.  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's quite the-- the personal anecdote there.  DICK CHENEY: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Mister Vice President for joining us and sharing your memories.  DICK CHENEY: Thank you, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Up next, we're going to be talking about that bombshell development in the Russia investigation that President Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen lied to Congress. The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee Virginia's Mark Warner is here to tell us what that means.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back. We are remembering the life and legacy of the forty-first President. We'll have continuing coverage on all CBS platforms throughout the week as the country mourns the former President.  And we'll be back here on FACE THE NATION with much more of the week that was.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including Virginia's senator Mark Warner. Our political panel will also be ahead with more on the life and legacy of President George H. W. Bush. Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Virginia's senator Mark Warner is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee and he joins us here. Senator, as a Democrat, how do you remember Bush 41?  SENATOR MARK WARNER (Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman/D-Virginia/@MarkWarner): President Bush was a class act and I think he realized, and reflecting on this program this morning, American leadership is critical. But that leadership needs to be both economic, military but also moral leadership. And I think President Bush did think about the transition from the end of the Cold War, as Vice President Cheney was mentioning, or his ability to deal with the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre in China--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: --or his situation with Kuwait. He always knew that America was stronger with alliances and the rest of the world looked to that American leadership in all those realms, as I mentioned, militarily economically but also morally, and I think it would be-- all of us as we reflect on his legacy to remember that those lessons are still important for all of us to keep in mind.  MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're describing a different brand of Republicanism than, than what you're seeing now?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, a bit different, yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to-- I want to get to your role right now on the Senate Intelligence Committee  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --where you are the ranking member. This week we heard that the President's former personal attorney Michael Cohen pled guilty to lying to Congress about financial interests, specifically, a building in Moscow that the Trump Organization was seeking to build during the campaign. And that was, reportedly, discovered after the-- after the special counsel came and asked your committee for a transcript of what Michael Cohen had said. What does all of this signal to you?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, it signals one, that if you lie to Congress and I was with our chairman, Chairman Burr on Friday when he said, if you lie to Congress, we're going to go after you, we're going to make sure that gets referred and we've made a number--  MARGARET BRENNAN: It's rare to go forward with the prosecution.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: --we've made a number of referrals. But I think what it also says is that Donald Trump as a candidate said no dealings with Russia. I think if I'd been a Republican dem-- a Republican delegate going into the summer of 2016 I think it would have been a relevant fact to know that actually Donald Trump was still trying to do business with the Russian government, maybe that's why he was so reluctant to say anything bad about Vladimir Putin. What we also know at this point is not only were this ongoing business deal but you had the president's son and his son-in-law meeting with Russians. We had the President's campaign aides--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: --being aware that there were the Hillary Clinton e-mails. We had the President's campaign chairman Paul Manafort offering to brief Ru-- Russian agents. There seems to be all of these past lead to ties with Russia and Mister Trump continues to deny any of that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President is, essentially, saying seeking a profit is not a crime, right? And-- and separating out this allegation of collusion with Russian intelligence versus his-- his organization's business interest.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: But, Margaret, what I'd-- what I'd say is, we can debate whether it's a crime or not, but he was, during that period, was denying any ties to Russia.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: And I do think it would have been a relevant factor, frankly, for Republican delegates to know that during that time period when he was saying only good things about Vladimir Putin, as a candidate for president he was still trying to do business with that very same government.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know that candidate Trump knew about the pursuit of this tower?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Again, I'm not-- I only know what Mister Cohen has said and, clearly, most of the individuals that are affiliated with Trump--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: --have led themselves into being accused of lying although he--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Was he instructed to lie? Michael Cohen?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: I don't know. I think that is a very relevant question that the American people need an answer to.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You said at the beginning of our conversation you've made a number of referrals. Now to be clear, what you're investigating here is sort of parallel to what the special counsel is doing there in terms of-- of pursuing criminal charges, potentially. But we saw these two probes intersect this week. When you say you've made a number of referrals, are you saying you've said to the special counsel a number of Trump associates are lying and we have proof of it?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Again, I'm not going to go into which individuals have been referred, but what--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But what were they referred for?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if we've seen something that we feel it would be appropriate to go to the special prosecutor, as Chairman Burr mentioned, we'll make those referrals. And we want to make clear that lying to Congress is a crime.  MARGARET BRENNAN: In the case of Michael Cohen, the special counsel came to you. Is that correct?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: We have an ongoing relationship with the special counsel. We have as you said, though, two different approaches. The special prosecutor is a criminal investigation. We are a counterintelligence investigation--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: --and we've concluded, obviously, that Russia intervened-- intervened massively and we need to preclude that from happening again. We're also looking into the question of whether that-- there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. I believe there are clear evidence that the Russians were offering information about Hillary Clinton. We know that. That's been documented in a number of these meetings. The question about whether it was full conclusion-- collusion, that is something both Chairman Burr and I are reserving judgment until we see all of the witnesses and we've got more folks to see.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Matter of other business. You saw the President at this gathering of world leaders in Argentina. He unveiled what is an agreement, I guess, in principle with Mexico and Canada for a new free trade deal. He says he's going to reject the old NAFTA and get this new one approved and in place, no problem. Is it going to be that simple?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: It's not going to be that simple. Candidly, he-- based on, and I've not done a full review at this point. But I think he could have actually renegotiated most of this activity within the existing NAFTA framework. But he wanted to put his own stamp on and now Congress has a right to come in and review whether it's labor, whether it's environmental, whether the deal is actually better. I think those are all open questions and I think you've already seen pushback from folks on both sides of the aisle.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're not ready to say you're going to vote for--  SENATOR MARK WARNER: I'm not--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --or against it?  SENATOR MARK WARNER: --ready at all at this point.  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator, thank you for joining us.  SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more FACE THE NATION and our panel.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: For more insight into this week's political news, we're joined now by Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, plus, David Nakamura and Seung Min Kim, both of whom cover the White House. David from The Washington Post, Seung Min from Capitol Hill. These days, Seung Min, we just spoke to Mark Warner on Senate intelligence, who was sort of making sense of-- of how he sees the decision from Michael Cohen to plead guilty to lying to Congress. This is not a crime that is very often prosecuted. How is this decision to move ahead sort of seen on Capitol Hill? Is this tightening the probe, more closely around the President, or is this just a process, a prosecution?  SEUNG MIN KIM (The Washington Post/@seungminkim): Well, what I find really interesting about the charge that Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to over the week, lying to Congress is remember that a lot of people have talked to Congress throughout the course of all these Russia investigations. The-- the panels that have been investigating the Russia issues have been House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intel Committee which Warner is the-- is one of the heads of and the Senate Judiciary Committee. And there are a lot of characters who have given a lot of different statements to Congress. So what I found really stark in addition to Senator Warner's comments on your show was what Senator Burr, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said just on Friday at a forum in Texas. And he said, \"If you lie to Congress, we are going to come after you.\"  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  SEUNG MIN KIM: And he says the committee is constantly reviewing testimony of the-- that they had gotten over the last year, looking for inconsistencies, they've made referrals to the special counsel, to DOJ. So that's a pretty big hint to us that we should be-- we should continue to watch what Mueller is up to.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and Senator Warner said a number of referrals have been made suggesting he is not the only Trump associate to have lied to Congress.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG (The Atlantic/@JeffreyGoldberg): Yeah-- no. You know, one of the amazing things here is that we're all, the country, the world even waiting for the Mueller report. We're getting the Mueller report. Every day, he's-- he's-- he's-- he's writing the report for us through these investigations, through these informations, through these-- through these prosecutions. I think I was just on the Hill this week asking a number of Democrats how aggressive they think this is going to get. They think it's going to get extraordinarily aggressive and we're going to be entering a whole new phase where the subpoenas are going to be coming, flying fast and furious, and the fights between the White House and Congress over who can-- who will be able to testify are going to be ferocious.  DAVID NAKAMURA (The Washington Post/@DavidNakamura): I mean, you're already seeing it in even other places. I mean you were seeing anger from the Hill about the administration's cooperation or lack thereof in briefing over the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. I mean you had two senior officials go to the Hill, Mattis and Pompeo, and deliver some sort of briefing about what the administration knows about this. But Gina Haspel, the CIA director, was not there. And so you're already seeing Lindsey Graham and others, even on Republican side, being upset about this administration and-- and they're-- them trying to do oversight. So I think--  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. And if Trump loses Lindsey Graham on this, you know how the rest of the-- the Hill is going to take this.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Well, I-- I want to come to one of the other disputes on the Hill, which was Republican Senator Jeff Flake, this week, he got a lot of flak from fellow Republicans for his decision to with-- withhold his vote, basically hold hostage until there is some sort of hearing for this bill to protect the special counsel from being fired. Many Republicans say this is a lost cause, why is Jeff Flake pushing this when Republican leaders will never let this go to a vote?  SEUNG MIN KIM: Well, this is his kind of his last grasp the powers since he is going out of-- since he's leaving office in a few weeks. But he has felt-- he has told us several times that he has felt increasingly concerned about the fate of the Mueller probe particularly triggered by the appointment of Matt Whitaker as the acting attorney general. We know Mister Whitaker has had public comments before his current position that disparage the Mueller probe. Mostly, all Democrats share that concern as well. But I've been asking some Republican sources why not just give Jeff Flake the-- the vote so he can move on? You guys can vote on all the--  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Parting gift.  SEUNG MIN KIM: Exactly. You guys can vote on all the judges that you want, but this is-- this would be a very difficult vote. First of all, people say, \"Don't want to reward bad behavior on Capitol Hill. But sometimes that works, and also it's going to be a difficult vote for a lot of Republicans and they want to avoid that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your organization's reporting, though, on this issue as well because Jeff Flake was blamed for blocking certain federal judge from moving ahead.  SEUNG MIN KIM: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's really not just all about Jeff Flake on this one particular issue, right? You had uncovered some reporting about Thomas Farr.  SEUNG MIN KIM: Exactly. So Thomas Farr was a person who was up for federal judgeship in North Carolina. He had worked for Jesse Helms-- the former Jesse Helms-- Senator Jesse Helms in '84 and '90. And we at The Washington Post uncovered an old DOJ memo earlier this week that a lot of senators, a growing group of senators, including Senator Tim Scott who, eventually, said he would vote against the nominee. But other senators as well that said it raises questions about whether this nominee Thomas Farr had any knowledge or involvement in this effort to this-- disenfranchise black voters in North Carolina during the 1990 campaign. So it shows a couple of things. First of all, that while Trump has had a lot of success in transforming the federal judiciary in a conservative fashion he is still running into a lot of obstacles because of the types of nominees that he picks. And, two, the Senate very narrow majority in the Republican Senates, so--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Hmm.  SEUNG MIN KIM: --one person really does have a lot of power here.  MARGARET BRENNAN: David, the President in leaving Argentina the gathering at the world-- at the G20, gathering of world leaders, has said there was a major success in coming to agreement with Xi Jinping of China. What was actually agreed to?  DAVID NAKAMURA: I think it's a more limited success. It did avert, you know, something of a potential, you know, I don't say catastrophe but, you know, next level of this trade war with China because new tariffs could go and have gone into effect at the beginning of next year. But they seem to have averted that at least for ninety days. They, basically, said they're going to have a truce, sort of a temporary cease-fire on these tariffs. The President will not raise the two hundred billion in tariffs from ten percent to twenty-five percent, something China really didn't want to happen. Return, China will buy-- agree to buy some more goods and to declare fentanyl as a controlled substance, something the President really wants to just sort of show that he was making inroads, in his words, to sort of deal with the opioid crisis. But I think more-- you know, deeper analysis shows that these intrinsic problems between U.S. and China on trade are not going away and to say that it could happen within ninety days is somewhat unrealistic.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  DAVID NAKAMURA: It's something that's gone on for a couple of years now.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: It does seem, though, that he blinked a little bit, and a lot of bluster about China, and then when push comes to shove, here we are. But he was generally, oddly, or, uncharacteristically, subdued I think at the G20, which is to say there were no-- he signed on to the statement, there were no outbursts, the-- the drama was with Putin and Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi Crown Prince. There was no associated drama. He was-- if you didn't know better you would say that he had-- following a-- a playbook written by more traditional presidents in multi-lateral settings. And I just found that noteworthy.  DAVID NAKAMURA: He canceled a press conference deferred to, you know, the-- the-- the eulogies to George H. W. Bush as well.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  DAVID NAKAMURA: But, you know, I think, you know, the President is feeling pressure on trade. The--- the announcement from GM to lay off fifteen thousand people, other, you know, sort of stock market volatility we've seen over the last couple of months has-- has worried the White House, this is something, obviously, the economy, you know, their-- one of their biggest focuses as he sort of starts to enter his reelection campaign.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. It's a success of the economy. The President says he's not being given credit for. Seung Min, how easy will it be to get this new NAFTA, the USMCA, as the President's branding it through?  SEUNG MIN KIM: Not easy at all. It-- I just started looking their statements of what senators have said on this deal. You have Elizabeth Warren saying it doesn't have enough protections for workers. You have Senator Pat Toomey as free trade as you can be, saying it doesn't-- he doesn't like these provisions involving investor protections in that new agreement. And you have Senator Rubio also saying, this deal is going to really hurt Florida's seasonal vegetable grower industry. So there's a lot of broader philosophical concerns, parochial concerns. And so either the administration is going to have to really twist arms here--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  SEUNG MIN KIM: --or work out a lot of these side deals--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly. Has the government shutdown been averted?  SEUNG MIN KIM: Check back in with us on Friday, we'll see.  DAVID NAKAMURA: Check the President's Twitter feed.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: You never-- you never say that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. Exactly. The President had hinted possibly he might sign off on-- on something that will buy a bit more time in deference to allow those to mourn the passing of Bush 41. But we will see. That is the safe bet in Trump's Washington. Let's see what happens.  SEUNG MIN KIM: Yeah.  JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment with our panel and look back at the legacy of George H. W. Bush.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with Bob Schieffer. Plus, Susan Page, Washington bureau chief for USA Today, and author of The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty. Also joining us, Jerry Seib of the Wall Street Journal. All three of these very esteemed journalists have covered Bush 41 and Washington through the years, so it can really give us that perspective. And, Jerry, I want to start with you, because you've been taking a look at the impact 41 had in terms of global leadership.  GERALD SEIB (The Wall Street Journal/@GeraldFSeib): Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What was that legacy?  GERALD SEIB: Well, I mean it's a remarkable period of time, you have the Tiananmen Square episode, you have the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin wall, the reunification of Germany. But I think there are two things really that ought to be remembered. One is he oversaw the end of the Cold War and the unification of Germany without a shot being fired, which was a really remarkable achievement, was not a foregone conclusion. It probably didn't get enough credit for it at the time.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Angela Merkel gave him credit for it the other day.  GERALD SEIB: Thank-- she should have. So in-- in the second, of course, the Iraq war. And I think what's interesting about the first Gulf War was he went into Kuwait, he led a coalition, they drove Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait back into Iraq and then he stopped. In other words, he said, our mission is limited. We're going to free Kuwait and we are not going to go in and try to change the government in Iraq. And as we learned some years later that was a very wise decision.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What you're describing here, multi- literalism, working with allies, restraint, speaking out at times about shared values versus national interest, this sounds like a-- in some ways, anachronistic description of Republican Party, you know, values and standards. Is it?  BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, George Bush was part of that generation that shaped world order--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  BOB SCHIEFFER: --after-- after World War II. And-- and just to add to one thing that Jerry said, in addition to going into Kuwait and then going back and stopping, he also got that remarkable coalition of-- of countries that he put together to pay for it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  GERALD SEIB: Mm-Hm. Yeah.  BOB SCHIEFFER: Which is almost unheard of in this day and time. They actually paid for it. But George Bush was-- he represented mainstream Republican thinking of that time. And that is that America is part of the world; he had great respect for our alliances. He understood that when America was at its best was when they were-- when we were working with people who shared our values, our allies, he had a great respect for NATO, and all of these alliances that came about after World War II. So the fact that-- he had had all these jobs, he had this great resume. He actually learned from it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  GERALD SEIB: Yeah.  BOB SCHIEFFER: I think you can say that he-- he-- while it was there, he just didn't sit around. He-- he learned a lot.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's interesting, Susan, because these days we talk about not being part of Washington. Coming in with different experience as being a virtue, whereas what you're describing is, he held, you know, experience at the very highest levels of power bases here in Washington before getting to the Oval Office.  SUSAN PAGE (USA Today/@SusanPage): And, you know, the passage of time has been kind to George H. W. Bush. We talk about journalism being the first draft of history, but the second draft sometimes looks different than the first draft. And I think some of the things that-- some of the consequences of his presidency looks so much better with the passage of time, including, for instance, his restraint in dealing with Saddam Hussein in the situation in Iraq. Some Presidents seems smaller after a little time has passed, George Bush seems bigger than he did at the time he was defeated for a second term, something that left a-- a terrible wound, although I think not some big scars on him, healed when his son was elected.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And what is the domestic legacy here? I mean we're talking about his place in the world but who was he to America?  SUSAN PAGE: So, you know his domestic legacy is marred somewhat because he was seen as being a little insensitive or unaware, not in touch with economic anxieties Americans were feeling. In 1992 Bill Clinton was exquis-- exquisitely, I'm not trying to say that word, aware of that. But his domestic legacy is actually pretty muscular. He signed the Americans with Disabilities Act, that's a significant piece of legislation. He gave a national address on addressing AIDS. And I think it's easy for us to forget now how much of a breakthrough that was at that time, a great stigma attached to HIV/AIDS. He gave an address, and in the address, talked about the lessons he learned from the death of his daughter from leukemia. At the time she died, leukemia also had a great stigma. He talked about the need to address people with AIDS with respect and dignity, and that was a remarkable speech that he gave during his presidency.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You know I-- I've read interviews where 41 said he didn't like the word dynasty or, you know, talking about his family. But he was the son of a senator and the father of a President. Is-- is the Bush family still going to continue to be part of this sort of political landscape of this country or are we seeing the sunset on the type of Republicanism the type of leader that you all are-- are describing?  GERALD SEIB: Well, you know, in a way I think that George H. W. Bush is sort of the last of the breed. I mean this was a generation as Bob said that when he came to Washington, the town was full of people who were bonded by joint service in World War II, which was more important than where they came from, more important than the party they represented. And that's been lost. And I think one of the other things that's been lost is the kind of the sense of decency and civility that I think he represented, and that in many ways the Bush family represented. And I don't-- the-- the Bush family's political history is woven all through the twentieth century history of America. Will that be true in the twenty-first century? I'm not so sure. But there is a sense in which I think the George H. W. Bush version of Republicanism is kind of gone.  BOB SCHIEFFER: You know that's an interesting point, too. I mean George H. W. Bush and his son both had great respect for the presidency, the office of the presidency. You know George W. Bush, you didn't come into the Oval Office unless you were wearing a suit and tie, and he got that from-- from his dad. I mean, you know, you can say, well, that's kind of, whatever. But the fact is, it shows the respect and the dignity that the office deserves and-- and they were very big on that. And I think they were right about it.  SUSAN PAGE: You know, and they extended that to the current President. You know, obviously, the Bush family had a lot of conflicts with Donald Trump, including the fact that he defeated Jeb Bush for the Republican nomination in 2016. We know that the Bushes didn't-- George-- Barbara Bush didn't vote for Donald Trump. But he's invited to the funeral. And I think there was never any question that that would happen because in George Bush's mind, that was the right thing to do--to show respect to the current occupant.  MARGARET BRENNAN: He did not attend Barbara Bush's funeral.  SUSAN PAGE: He did not. Now there is some history where Presidents, sitting Presidents, do not attend the funerals of former first ladies. So that was not a break with precedent. But we have little doubt that Barbara Bush did not think much of Donald Trump. And she was a woman who-- who spoke her mind. She wrote in her son's name when she voted in 2016 for President.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. Well, thank you all of you. I know throughout the week we're going to be remembering the legacy of 41 here on CBS.  And we will be right back with FACE THE NATION.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay with CBS all week where we will have continuing coverage as the nation pays tribute to the 41st President. He will be laid to rest on Wednesday. And we will have coverage of it throughout our CBS platforms.  But for us on FACE THE NATION, that is it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week on FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0",

It is great to have you on the show. MICHAEL VICKERS: It's a pleasure. Congratulations on the podcast. MICHAEL MORELL: Thank you so much. I should start by telling people, acknowledging to people that you and I are close friends-- which grew out of us spending so much time together in the Situation Room, and grew out of you and I really seeing eye to eye on the importance of putting intense pressure on terrorist organizations that were trying to kill Americans. MICHAEL VICKERS: Absolutely. MICHAEL MORELL: So people need to know that you and I are friends here. Let me start by asking a question that I think many of our listeners will have: what is defense intelligence? And how does that differ from national level intelligence or strategic intelligence? MICHAEL VICKERS: So many of the intelligence organizations that comprise the 17-member intelligence community are defense organizations, about half of them. So four big national agencies: National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence agency, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and National Reconnaissance Office, and then the intelligence organizations of the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corp. So they tend to focus more on defense issues, but also provide national intelligence in their respective domains. NSA and the Signals Intelligence Area and code making, code breaking; NGA in imagery interpretation and mapping. MICHAEL MORELL: And so when you were the undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, all of the defense intelligence entities reported to you, you were in charge of all of that? MICHAEL VICKERS: Yeah. I exercised the secretary of defense's authority, direction, and control over the Defense Intelligence Enterprise-- which comprised all those elements, but in the national intelligence realm shared that responsibility with the DNI-- Jim Clapper. MICHAEL MORELL: And so some of the leaders of those organizations actually reported to both of you? MICHAEL VICKERS: Yes. Both to the secretary of defense, through me, and then to the DNI. MICHAEL MORELL: Mike, I know you're in the process of writing a book about your career-- and I can't wait to read it-- and we will have you back on the show when the book gets published to talk in detail about your time in government and all the things you did. But what I'd love to do today is to concentrate on the world today, what the U.S. is doing that is working, what the U.S. is doing that's not working, what your advice would be for the government going forward on those things. But I did want to ask you a couple of career-related questions just so people get a sense of who you are and what you've done-- all without really taking anything away from your book because I know your publisher wouldn't be happy about that. (LAUGH) MICHAEL VICKERS: Sure. MICHAEL MORELL: Because I've been through this myself. MICHAEL VICKERS: You've been through it, yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: So your time as a C.I.A. operations officer was dominated by working on what is known as the Afghan Program. MICHAEL VICKERS: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: The C.I.A. covert action that provided support to the Freedom Fighters in Afghanistan who ultimately drove the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan-- and, quite frankly, which played a significant role in the ultimate fall, in my view, of the Soviet Union. So you have that on your resume, which is really cool thing. In fact, you even have a character in the movie, Charlie Wilson's War, who plays you-- (LAUGH) MICHAEL VICKERS: Indeed. MICHAEL MORELL: --this really smart, chess-playing, C.I.A. weapons expert. So that's really cool, too. But I just have two questions about that time in your career. And the first is what role did you actually play in the program? What did you actually do? MICHAEL VICKERS: So I was formerly the program officer, which meant I was the principal officer within C.I.A. responsible for that program, reporting up to officers with more senior responsibility, the Chief of South Asian Operations that had not only Afghanistan and Pakistan in the director of the operations, but Iran to Bangladesh, his boss in the Northeast and South Asia division to the Deputy Director of Operations to the Director of Central Intelligence. MICHAEL MORELL: And how long did you do that-- MICHAEL VICKERS: I did that-- MICHAEL MORELL: --for? MICHAEL VICKERS: --for two years. '84 to '86, those were the divisive years when we decided to go for victory to drive the Soviets out. The strategy change was March of '85. And then-- MICHAEL MORELL: What was the strategy change? MICHAEL VICKERS: It was to shift from a strategy of imposing costs on the Soviet Union, but really without hopes of defeating them; just making their intervention in Afghanistan expensive to actually driving them out. And this was codified in a national security decision directive, a top secret compartmented directive at the time that since has been declassified-- called NSDD 166 that I helped author. MICHAEL MORELL: And the change in strategy led to a significant change in what you were doing or how you were doing it and level of what you were doing? MICHAEL VICKERS: Yes. So there were additional resources provided to C.I.A. about a fivefold increase in resources in Charlie Wilson just before that. And that triggered a strategic review, a big interagency review that I know you're familiar with. And then the new strategy led to additional resources. So within a scope of a year, the program increased by a factor of 11 times. And the quantity and quality of weapons, training, intelligence support, everything went dramatically up-- culminating in the decision to introduce the stinger surface to air missile system in March of 1986. MICHAEL MORELL: Which is critically important because the Soviet helicopters were wreaking havoc. MICHAEL VICKERS: Right. So it along with a lot of other weapons really changed the air balance pretty significantly. But a lot of other things contributed as well. And ironically, the Soviets-- you may remember, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power about the same time as our National Security directive in March of 1985, and he escalated the war; he did his own surge like our Iraq and Afghanistan surges of recent years-- but took his top general from Eastern Europe and put him in there, gave him one year to turn the situation around. So this was really a battle of surges in 1985. And we and the Afghan resistance won. MICHAEL MORELL: Great for the United States and for C.I.A. and-- MICHAEL VICKERS: Well, with the tragic-- yes, it's the largest and most people say the most successful covert action program in in C.I.A.'s history -- but not without its tragic consequences eventually leading to 9/11. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So that's the other question I wanted to ask you. And that is did we get the aftermath of that success wrong, right? Did we not do some things that we should have done in Afghanistan-- post-that success, right? Because some of those Freedom Fighters ended up being terrorists. Are there things you think we could've done to prevent that unintended consequence? MICHAEL VICKERS: Yeah. So it was a series of -- the short answer is yes. I mean, we should've stayed engaged there. It was complicated by the fact that our main objective-- MICHAEL MORELL: And you don't militarily, you mean politically-- MICHAEL VICKERS: Politically-- MICHAEL MORELL: --and diplomatically-- MICHAEL VICKERS: --diplomatically with aid and also an intelligence presence and some security assistance. I don't mean militarily. But a couple things complicated that. One, Pakistan was on a path to developing nuclear weapons, and there was Congressional legislation that when they crossed a certain threshold toward that goal and the president couldn't certify that they hadn't crossed that threshold, we had a lot of aid to Pakistan and it had to be suspended. That occurred in 1990 right after -- the year after the Soviets withdrew, but there was still the insurgency going on 'till 1992 in Afghanistan. Second, you know, as you know, the Berlin Wall fell, East Europe was liberated, the U.S. government, the Bush administration became very focused on consolidating its gains in Europe-- historical gains at the end of the Cold War, and thought Afghanistan and Pakistan was more a regional problem. Everyone knew there would be continued civil war. How long it would take the Resistance to win was a matter of some debate. But no one imagined at the time that it would become a sanctuary for a new global Jihadist terrorist organization and then with such tragic consequences for us. And then of course the Soviet Union collapsed, and (UNINTEL) turned a lot towards Russia. Afghanistan went into a brutal civil war for some years before the Taliban emerged in 1996 and then Al Qaeda came. So we had several opportunities-- albeit difficult ones to at least stay more engaged than we were-- I think it was a lack of strategic foresight. And then also the second phase of this as the Al Qaeda threat was developing to take more aggressive action across two administrations, just the beginning of the Bush administration, but a lot of Clinton years where we looked at options, but really didn't do much other than-- MICHAEL MORELL: We had two embassies attacked, we had a U.S. war ship attacked, and-- MICHAEL VICKERS: Right. And so we knew-- MICHAEL MORELL: --very little response. MICHAEL VICKERS: You know, and C.I.A. was warning about this growing threat, but we essentially didn't do enough, and it's one of the big lessons of counter terrorism, as you know, not to let them build up a sanctuary for that period of time. We would-- I hope we would never make that mistake again. MICHAEL MORELL: Let me ask you one more question about the past before we jump to the issues of the day, Mike. You are one of the most non-partisan people that I know. I'm your friend, and I really don't know if you vote more Democrat or more Republican, I just have no idea; that's how non-partisan you are. But like me, you found yourself stepping out of that non-partisan role and endorsing Hillary Clinton. Why did you do that? MICHAEL VICKERS: I thought she was an effective Secretary of State in the years that we served with her with Bob Gates as Secretary of Defense and Leon Panetta at C.I.A., thought it was a very, very strong team-- the first Obama term. And I thought her foreign policy views based on that or national security views were more in line-- MICHAEL MORELL: She was tough. MICHAEL VICKERS: --with my traditional views. MICHAEL MORELL: She was-- MICHAEL VICKERS: She was pretty-- MICHAEL MORELL: --tough. MICHAEL VICKERS: --tough. And so that really shaped my-- I, you know, I'm not an isolationist, I believe the United States has to be engaged. If a Republican had looked just like Hillary Clinton or slightly different, you know, different economic philosophy or something, then I certainly would've remained neutral in that regard. You know, as you say, my tradition is more to be non-partisan. But in this case, I thought it was-- MICHAEL MORELL: Did you have second --thoughts about doing that? MICHAEL VICKERS: Yeah, it was my first and only, and I have had-- MICHAEL MORELL: Me, too. MICHAEL VICKERS: --second thoughts just-- MICHAEL MORELL: Me, too. MICHAEL VICKERS: -- about to-- you know, as intelligence officers, we're trained to call it as we see it, but then stop there. MICHAEL MORELL: Right, right. Okay, the world today. Mike, overall, how do you think the Trump administration is doing dealing with the national security threats and challenges that our country faces? Sort of what grade would you give the administration? And is there a difference in how you think about that grade between what the administration is actually doing and how the president talks about it? So how do you think in general about how they're doing? MICHAEL VICKERS: Yeah. So I do think there is a difference between how the president talks about foreign policy and national security strategy and what the administration actually does. There are some fine people in the administration who are doing very commendable work. And as you know, a lot of the business of the U.S. government goes on in the intelligence community; we continue to collect and analyze intelligence-- and prepare for conflict in the Department of Defense-- and engage in operations. So overall-- I would give them reasonably good marks on further dismantling the global Jihadist threat both Al Qaeda and ISIS. The challenge will really be the strategic challenge has always been once you take them down, can you prevent their reconstitution? And so the jury is really out on that, and that's nested in the broader Middle East strategy and South and Central Asia strategy that I think there is some cause for concern particularly given the turbulence in the region. With Iran, the other sort of Middle Eastern threat, I think we made a mistake across two administrations by not making life more difficult for them and the Russians and Syria; I think we missed an opportunity. And I think our hands-off, indirect approach to the conflict in Yemen has resulted in a lot of civilian casualties and it's also produced indecisive results. And therefore the Iranians, with their proxy, the Houthis, have sort of hung on. So in terms of the concerns about Iran, in terms of regional meddling-- I don't think we've fully addressed that problem. I think new sanctions won't really address that in the same way as-- MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So let's maybe take these one at a time. So let's go back to counterterrorism for a second. How do you see the threat today from the global Jihadist movement? How would you characterize the threat today? You know, ISIS has essentially lost its caliphate. But how do you think about the threat today? MICHAEL VICKERS: Yeah. So as long as they don't have a sanctuary and time where they can plot global attacks, develop capabilities, new technologies, train operatives, that typically is a year to a few-year cycle, unless they have them handy. And so that threat, I think, has been diminished. The global Jihadist movement is either hanging on for dear life in various places or more dispersed, but they have footholds in a lot of different regions, in North Africa and Libya, they still have cells in Europe, in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, and then-- MICHAEL MORELL: East Asia. MICHAEL VICKERS: --Syria, Yemen, East Asia. The threat has grown some in Southeast Asia actually, which has been generally a more dormant theater. So their ability to mount really sophisticated, catastrophic attacks is certainly down, but not the threat of more local attacks in several regions. MICHAEL MORELL: And would you agree that if we don't keep the pressure on them in all of these places, that the risk of them developing the capability to attack us again is a real possibility? MICHAEL VICKERS: Yes. I think that-- MICHAEL MORELL: That's what we learned at the end of the day-- MICHAEL VICKERS: That's what we learned. MICHAEL MORELL: --right? MICHAEL VICKERS: That's what we learned at the end of the day. And so it's imperative to keep the pressure on, and that means leveraging our advantages in armed reconnaissance, drone warfare, essentially, but also the global network of partners that we built, and all the intelligence and security sharing with these countries that allow us to more nip threats in the bud, and that's essentially to keep the threat at manageable levels. MICHAEL MORELL: And is your sense that the administration is doing a pretty good job on that? MICHAEL VICKERS: I think in terms of keeping on the pressure on, in terms of the precision strikes and armed reconnaissance, yes, I think they're doing a pretty good job on that. In terms of-- and continuing to take some senior leaders off the battlefield, some very important ones, potentially. In terms of sustaining the global network of partners, which is sort of the other side of it, I think the jury's out a bit on that. MICHAEL MORELL: Because we're challenging our allies rather than embracing them in some cases? MICHAEL VICKERS: Right, right. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay, so back to Iran for a second. So were you a supporter of the Iran Nuclear Deal? Or did you have concerns about it? How did you think about it? MICHAEL VICKERS: Yeah, so both. I mean, I was a supporter at the end of the day because I think it was the, in purely nuclear terms, I think it was the best option we had to retard their program for a reasonable period of time. And so in that sense I think as a narrow arms control agreement, for all its faults in that area that it's not indefinite, it did buy us some time, and in that sense it was successful. In terms of not being part of a broader, comprehensive Iran strategy where he pressure was taken off across the board, what pressure there had been before, which probably wasn't adequate to begin with-- then I don't think it could meet its intent. And so I think that criticism is fair in terms of not doing anything to restrain their proxy activities, their unconventional warfare-- MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So there's-- so I have two questions for you. One is, I don't think any administration has pushed hard enough back on what the Iranians do in the region. MICHAEL VICKERS: I would agree with that. MICHAEL MORELL: And my question is why do you think is that the case? Why have we not done that? MICHAEL VICKERS: Well, I think it varies by case. So, you know, if you go back to the Reagan administration where they started building Hezbollah and kidnapping and torturing our diplomats and colleagues in the C.I.A. and-- MICHAEL MORELL: Bombing the-- MICHAEL VICKERS: And bombing the-- MICHAEL MORELL: --Embassy in Beirut-- MICHAEL VICKERS: --embassies, and the Marine barracks -- MICHAEL MORELL: Right. MICHAEL VICKERS: You know, I think that was viewed as a very local conflict, that if we disengaged, the problem would go away. And to some extent, it did, but it was a victory for Iran. And then I think if you look at the Bush administration-- there were just so many other things going on almost like the first Bush administration. MICHAEL MORELL: --we had Iran providing sophisticated IEDs to Shia militia groups in Iraq that were killing American soldiers. MICHAEL VICKERS: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: Right? And not much of a pushback. MICHAEL VICKERS: Right. So for instance, we did things against them in Iraq, but were hesitant about doing muc more than that or certainly some cross border things-- without going into details. And that puts you in the same kind of sandwich we found ourselves in in South East Asia where, you know, you draw the line in the conflict right here, and then you let the enemies on both sides treat you as a punching bag. MICHAEL MORELL: I think this is a good Ph.D. dissertation for anybody out there who wants to write about this because it's a really fascinating thing that we haven't sufficiently pushed back for a long, long time. But the strategy now, right, the administration strategy now is to put so much pressure on the Iranians by renewing sanctions that we're able to get a better nuclear deal, and we're able to change their behavior with regard to regional influence. What do you see as the prospects of the success of that strategy? MICHAEL VICKERS: You know, I think the goals are reasonable ones. I don't think the likelihood of success is all that high. Now right now the Iranians have a lot of domestic challenges, and so this is an opportune time to put more pressure on them. The challenge is whether we can rally the international community enough, particularly now that you have more great power interest in the Middle East, which hadn't really had in the past couple decades with Russia-- and Russia's not going to do a lot to help the Iranian economy, but others might in some regard. And so I'm not confident that more sanctions of the type we're envisioning will really lead to the outcome we want. They've weathered a lot, you know, in the past, and I don't see any reason to think that they couldn't. I think it would take a combination of hitting them back harder in other places as well as pressure. And then also importantly, rallying the international community, which is much tougher today than it was, say, ten years ago. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. You know, my thought was always let's get the nuclear deal and then let's turn the page to the regional interference and put, you know, internationally and a multi-lateral approach, put as much pressure on them on the regional issues that we put on the nuclear issue. MICHAEL VICKERS: And I think those should've been entwined. I mean, again, it was a different time, different adversary, much more dangerous. But with the Soviet Union, that's precisely what we did in the 1980s just because we did arms control agreements and some breathtaking ones that were very good things, we didn't take the pressure off in Afghanistan, we didn't take the pressure off globally or rallying our European allies, et cetera. MICHAEL MORELL: Exactly. All right, North Korea, where do you think we are? MICHAEL VICKERS: I think tensions are down, which is good. North Korea is primarily a nuclear threat now, and a growing one, one that's made pretty dramatic progress in the past few years, both in weapons and delivery systems. I think the real danger for us in this is that we have started a process that, diplomatically, that may get out of control for us. We have very, very ambitious objectives that are keyed -- very rapid denuclearization -- that are keyed to this warming of relations. But it's not clear at the end that North Korea may be able to use this diplomatically to separate South Korea from us because South Korea looks like they're all in now on this warming of relations. And so if we decide, wait, you're not fulfilling your end of the bargain-- the train may have left the station at that point, and you may end up with a worse position in Northeast Asia than we have now. MICHAEL MORELL: So would you agree though that testing the proposition as to whether this guy is willing to negotiate a way his nuclear weapons is worth it, makes sense? MICHAEL VICKERS: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: And the trick then is if he's not, how do we move forward then? That's the complicating factor here. MICHAEL VICKERS: Right. And still retain your alliances and all your capabilities. MICHAEL MORELL: And what's your bet? Do you think he's actually willing to negotiate a way for a price? Or do you think his intent is to hang on to at least some part of his program, to sort of have his cake and eat it, too? What do you think? MICHAEL VICKERS: I think it's more cake and eat it, too, and then achieve other diplomatic objectives. To me, the price would have to be so high-- that doesn't have North Korea economically absorbed by South that it just seems implausible in regional terms or U.S. terms that we could sufficiently meet those demands. I mean, this is ultimately his insurance card. MICHAEL MORELL: So we may find ourselves back in a situation at some point? Maybe not next week or six months from now or a year from now, but we may find ourselves back at some point and having to make a choice between living with this program or dealing with it militarily? MICHAEL VICKERS: Yeah. Now again, on the strategic side, this is an area where deterrence does seem to work. I mean, you really have to have a mad man theory to say that because the end result is obliteration for them. The weapons are useful to deter us from changing the regime -- they're not useful for a bolt out of a blue that then ends in the destruction of his regime. So I think there's a lot of ways this could turn out. And it's possible there could be, you know, a partial deal of some partial denuclearization, lessening of tensions, that still let them remain a nuclear power, but with trying to achieve the goals of more economic development that still puts us better off than we were before. But that will be a pretty sophisticated diplomatic play to keep South Korea on our side-- the Russians and Chinese who haven't always been helpful. Sometimes the Chinese are helpful, sometimes not; the Russians, less so-- to pull off this diplomatic hat trick. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay, Russia. How should we think about Russia and the threat that they pose to the United States? And what should we do about it? MICHAEL VICKERS: So I think Russia actually is our most immediate threat right now and has been. I think what they did in intervening in our 2016 presidential election was brazen. They really didn't care if they got caught in a lot of ways. I think it was quite successful, and they're still at it. And ironically, they're using American tools, American creations, the creation of an open global economy where money and things can flow freely. And then innovation, the invention of social media to attack American weaknesses, our polarization, our economic dislocation and others to heighten tensions that were already there. So, you know, in a way it's not cer-- and it also had the benefit of the strategy surprise. This really, I think, wasn't on people's radar screens. And where they were having their biggest effect in social media, we weren't monitoring until too late. I don't think we'll make that mistake again, but at the time, I think all those things conspired to why I think it works so well. You know, Russia's strategy is really to restore its great power status; it sees its primary aim as weakening its opponents in Europe and the United States. It knows it really can't compete head to head -- so they're engaged in the strategy attrition campaign, mostly an intelligence war with us with a lot of -- their term for covert actions is active measures -- to essentially weaken us, to attack our will and our cohesion rather than our capabilities. And that's probably the-- MICHAEL MORELL: So what do we do about that? MICHAEL VICKERS: So it's a combination, I think, of offense and defense. We're in this with the Europeans. It's fundamentally a political and informational problem to rally people that you're being attacked and you shouldn't like it. You know, intelligence can play its role and law enforcement in terms of discovery and presenting evidence, it's naming and shaming in certain cases. But it's also some elements of hitting back with various tools as well; you just can't play defense. The other side of Russian strategy is to, you know, fight wars largely on their periphery where they have time and space advantages or ethnic advantages-- but then also put in hybrid war, both unconventional and conventional, but then escalate to strategic level with a threat in cyber-attack or something else short of nuclear weapons that could bring the conflict to an end. We don't necessarily have a good answer to that as a defense problem. That's-- it's something we need to work on, both how to defend very far forward or to achieve deterrence. But also then when they threaten to escalate because they know if the war goes on they will lose-- how do we manage that escalation to where they can't declare victory and go home? MICHAEL MORELL: Okay-- China. If Russia is the most immediate, maybe China is the most long-term-- MICHAEL VICKERS: No, by far the greatest most challenging long-term threat. MICHAEL MORELL: --about that? MICHAEL VICKERS: Well, ultimately it's an economic and technological competition. Unlike the Cold War, it's about who is going to be the global leader-- first with the biggest economy and out of that will come political influence. But then secondarily-- who is the most innovative economy and creating the industries of the future. And then a related risk of that is does some of those technologies that are also creating industries of the future: biotechnology, artificial intelligence, potentially quantum technologies and others, do they have military effects that really can change the military balance. And so that's, you know, whether we're just in essentially a peacetime competition for who's going to have more sway in the global environment, conflict still deterred by nuclear weapons or limited by nuclear weapons-- or is there some breakthrough technologies that could really alter the balance. And that's sort of the 20 to 30-year problem that we have as a nation. How do we solve that challenge? MICHAEL MORELL: And we're both taking very different approaches to that competition, right? We're taking a market-based free enterprise approach, and they're taking a state-directed-resource approach to this competition. MICHAEL VICKERS: Right, and combinations of intellectual property theft and state directed and-- Xi Jinping has said they want to dominant future biotechnology and artificial intelligence. Now whether they can do that or not-- MICHAEL MORELL: So how do you think this plays ultimately? I know that's a really tough question. MICHAEL VICKERS: Well, it really turns-- you know, China's had an economic miracle over several decades that's almost unprecedented in economic history. And so whether they have bumps in the road or political bumps in the road that are associated with the economic downturns I think, you know, remains to be seen. And it also, I think, is contingent on the what's the nature of power and its relation to political stability and political cohesion in the future. So, for example-- China has four times the population we do. Is that an asset or a liability? I think the jury is out depending on how capital intensive or technology intensive, future industries or military power is. And if you can't, just as we see at home, if you leave people behind, you get political consequences to that. So I don't have an answer to that, I just believe it's our most important strategic challenge over the long haul. MICHAEL MORELL: Mike you've been incredibly gracious with your time. Just one more question. Like I was, you were deeply involved in the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And I know you'll talk in detail about that in your book. But what I wanted to ask you is what single moment in either the planning for the raid or during the raid or after the raid most stands out for you? MICHAEL VICKERS: That's tough, but I I can give you a few. So when I was one of the first people inside the U.S. government to be read in on the intelligence in late summer, early fall of 2010 by you, as a matter of fact, with the vice chairman, I was really struck at the intelligence case at that point; still circumstantial, but a lot of evidence pointing that there's really something there. And so-- MICHAEL MORELL: That was a neat moment in my office, actually. I remember that, too. MICHAEL VICKERS: Yeah, my adrenaline really went up. And then the same thing when we were directed to start planning-- operational options at Christmas time. It's the first time really I just didn't enjoy a Christmas with my family and wanted to get back right to work and work on those options. And then I remember our first meeting on options with President Obama where he said, \"We're going to do this. We're going to do it sooner rather than later, and we're going to do it unilaterally in the White House Situation Room.\" And we were still, I guess, six, eight weeks away from actually doing the operation, but I thought, holy cow, we better-- MICHAEL VICKERS: This is gonna happen. MICHAEL MORELL: This is gonna happen. MICHAEL VICKERS: And then I guess the final moment was-- you know all the things can go wrong from our experience with the Iranian and hostage rescue attempt and others, but, once we knew what had happened to that first helicopter that had landed the SEALs got out, I thought the only question remaining at that point was whether he's there or not, and we're going to know that in ten minutes. And so I felt a real sigh of relief when I saw the helicopter hadn't been shot down or-- It had a hard landing, our troops had gotten out, and then-- and now we'll know. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. All right, Mike, thanks for being with us. MICHAEL VICKERS: Sure. Great pleasure. * * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, that aired Sunday, September 9, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\"\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner who joins us today from one of my favorite cities Charlottesville Virginia. Senator thank you for coming on Face the Nation. We spoke with Vice President Mike Pence -- SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: -- who said that he has not been asked by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for an interview but that he would be willing to sit for one and help with that investigation. What do you make of that. SEN. WARNER: Well it seems to me that Mr. Pence is doing the appropriate activity. There is an ongoing investigation that's had now I believe six guilty pleas over 30 indictments. Guilty pleas have included the president's campaign manager the president's lawyer. The president's CFO has at least got immunity and Mr. Papadopoulos one of the president's foreign policy aides during the campaign clearly indicated that he had been offered dirt on Hillary Clinton and Clinton email. So there was outreach from from the Trump- from the Russians to the Trump operation. So the fact that Vice President Pence is cooperating is great. I wish his boss Mr. Trump would have the same level of cooperation. Donald Trump continues to say he's done nothing wrong then he should sit down and talk to the Mueller investigation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any questions for the vice president about what he may have known about what happened in 2016? SEN. WARNER: I'm not going to go through where we are at this point in our intelligence committee investigation. We've had interviewed over 100 folks we've still got folks like Mr. Papadopoulos and we'd love to get back Mr. Cohen that we want to pursue. But I do think the main activity and clearly Mr. Mueller has a lot more tools in his tool chest than we have at the Senate Intelligence Committee. MARGARET BRENNAN: So still no date in terms of when you might get George Papadopoulos a former foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign to sit and answer questions with you and do you intend to go back to the attorney general to ask why he gave very different testimony than George Papadopoulos has about conversations regarding setting up a meeting with Vladimir Putin. SEN. WARNER: I think that's something that I would imagine the Mueller investigation is looking into. We do want to see Papadopoulos. We also want to see Michael Cohen who has indicated that he would come back without any immunity and testify before our committee and our committee is the last bipartisan effort that's trying to pursue these facts. And if you- but if you step back from it and you look at all of the guilty pleas that Mueller has received and the total number of indictments the fact that this president still undermines the Mueller investigation. This president who this week is out you know basically calling into question somebody who wrote a memo about the activities -- or an op-ed -- the activities inside the White House a president who is basically asking the Justice Department to back off on criminal indictments of Republican members. This is not a president who understands how our system of laws and rule of law works. And that really bothers me and one of the reasons why I again I hope Mueller gets to the bottom of this. MARGARET BRENNAN: It doesn't sound like you're going to issue the Senate report before the November midterm races. SEN. WARNER: I think we'll be hard pressed. What we have- we had four pieces of our investigation before we got to collusion. The first which was reconfirming the intelligence community assessment that the Russians intervened to help Trump hurt Clinton. Second election security. And we've got bipartisan election security legislation that I wish the Senate would take up and pass. Unfortunately Majority Leader McConnell has held off on allowing us to vote on that. The third is and we will be fairly harsh on some of the activities from the Obama administration and the FBI. And then we've also- and just this past week we had another hearing on social media where again we're trying to look not only at what happened in 2016 but on a going forward basis and we made a lot of progress with at least Facebook and Twitter in terms of policy issues we can pursue. Then we've got this final issue obviously of collusion. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you see any national security concerns that would justify the president's call for the attorney general to look into who authored this anonymous op-ed by someone claiming to work within the administration?\u00a0 SEN. WARNER: I wish that whoever had written the op-ed would have revealed their identity, but I see absolutely no national security issues. I wonder when the Woodward- Woodward book comes out, and my understanding he has- he has documented interviews with over 100 folks in the White House, where this President is going to try to sic the Justice Department on all the folks who talked- talked to Bob Woodward. This is clearly a president that is, a White House that's in chaos, and a president that becoming more and more untethered. And if you just step back for a moment and look at the last three months. We've had a president who had this disastrous policy with separating kids and families at the border. We had the president who had a- a frankly, I think, unpresidential appearance with Vladimir Putin. A president who zigged and zagged on tariffs. These efforts around his senior officials who pled guilty. His, you know, frankly unseemly behavior toward John McCain. And now, this reactions to be both the book and the op-ed, it appears that the walls are closing in on this president and he's lashing out at-- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well, Secretary Mattis and Chief of Staff John Kelly have put on the record denials of some of the reporting from Bob Woodward out there. Do you take them at their word? SEN. WARNER: Well I know that Bob Woodward has done this a number of times to presidents of both parties. And usually he's been a pretty good journalist, but I'll let Mr. Woodward, and I have a great, great deal of respect for Secretary Mattis, let them litigate that out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Pence in our interview also said that the President was just speaking his mind and being candid, it was candor this week when he said that- that two Republican congressmen who have been indicted shouldn't have been, essentially, ahead of the midterm races. Does that trouble you those kind of statements or do you just brush this off as more, as the Vice President characterized, candor?\u00a0 SEN. WARNER: Well I think this is why this is a White House in chaos, because most responsible people in the White House realize the President of the United States can't make these comments without consequences. And this President is so irresponsible and I don't think we can continue to excuse his behavior as anything resembling normalcy. So, it'll be interesting to see whether my colleagues are willing to stand up and call out these activities. I think very shortly, as the Mueller probe continues, we're all going to be at that moment where history will judge us. And I think this president will be judged as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Warner, thank you for joining us on \"Face the Nation.\" SEN. WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.",

And this is FACE THE NATION.  Saturday's sendoff for John McCain capped an emotional week of tributes from family--  MEGHAN MCCAIN: My father was a great man. He was a great warrior. He was a great American. I admired him for all of these things, but I love him because he was a great father.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --friends--  JOE LIEBERMAN: There's a special satisfaction that comes from serving a cause greater than yourself. I heard John say those words hundreds of times, but for him we know they were not just words in a speech, they were the creed that he lived by.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --and political foes--  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: What better way to get a last laugh than to make George and I say nice things about him to a national audience.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Although McCain's biggest political antagonist was not in attendance, daughter Meghan sent some straight talk directly towards him.  MEGHAN MCCAIN: The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What's next for politics after McCain's passing? We'll talk with Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich. Plus, a conversation with McCain friend and Senate colleague John Kerry about his new book, Every Day Is Extra, reflections on his service to the country as a democratic nominee in 2004 and President Obama's Secretary of State.  All that, plus, plenty of political analysis coming up on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Thousands turned out at Washington National Cathedral yesterday to honor John McCain. Those who eulogized him rebuked the politics of today's political climate and remembered McCain as one who aspired to do better.  MEGHAN MCCAIN: We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty. Trafficking in bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage. It's a politics that pretends to be brave and tough but in fact is born of fear. John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the attendees at Saturday's memorial service for John McCain here in Washington was Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich. He joins me here. Thank you for coming in. I know you were there at the memorial service. Something that Senator McCain thought through, he planned--  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH (R-Ohio/@JohnKasich): Absolutely. Unbelievable.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --he orchestrated every little bit of it. What do you think his message was?  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: Come together. Have guts. Stand up. You know, I mean, that's the thing about John. John was so comfortable with himself. Leaders walk a lonely road. And John did not like people that did this-- put their finger in the air and get the wind. He was-- he was so comfortable with himself. And it really didn't matter to him who he was going to have to take on or what cause he was going to go for. If he felt it in his bones, in his heart, and his soul then he went forward and I think that was the message.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Meghan McCain, his daughter, delivered a really moving--  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: She made me cry.   MARGARET BRENNAN: She made you cry.  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: She made me cry for two reasons. One was the deep love she had for her father. And, you know, the other thing that made me cry? The deep love that sometimes girls have for their daddies. And I've got two little girls that are-- they're not little anymore. They're in college. And I---- it just brought everything home. She was-- she was just incredible. And--  MARGARET BRENNAN: She's her father's daughter. She was strong in her words.  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: Well, this-- yes, yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And it was clear who she was speaking about.  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: John McCain, no matter what position he took always figured out a way to build a bridge. And now we have a leader who is either unable or unwilling to unite the country and at the same time to be able to use this-- the strength, the strength of America, whether it's the economic, whether it's the military, or the political strength to make the world a better place. To use our leadership to raise the bar to get to a better place in the world and that-- these are the things that frustrated John that we were not unified.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there another Republican like John McCain? I mean-- because many of your fellow Republicans, many of them sitting there at that service would say yes the President may be a flawed individual but he is a flawed vessel for an agenda that we like. Whether it's tax reform or getting more conservative judges on courts throughout the country including the Supreme Court.  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's all excusable. It's a transaction.  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: Yeah. But-- but it is not a transaction and you know today we look for politicians that not only understand the issues but also can engage in a bit of poetry, can bring us together. So--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Who is that?  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: Well, right. I don't-- I don't think that's the time to project who that is. But I will tell you family separation is not American value at the border. It isn't. The idea we're going to deport these people that's-- that's not to me American value. Ringing up massive debt. We like the tax cut. But there was no tax reform. It was a problem. And trying to strip health care away from twenty million Americans. It seems as though we have been backing a lot of people into a corner using our power, our economic power to get what we want.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm.  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: And in the short run we might win. But think about somebody who's powerful, somebody who's rich who forces you to do things that you bitterly resent. There are better ways to get it done without having to use your power to extract what you want. Sometimes you've got to be tough as nails. McCain was. I am. But at the end most of the time it's persuasion, it's-- it's seeking the better angels in life that allow us to be more successful than just pounding on people.  MARGARET BRENNAN: As John McCain's longtime aide Mark Salter said sometimes he questions do you need to-- to kill the party of Trump to save the party of Lincoln. Is that where we are?  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: We're in a tug of war and we understand-- I understand the difficulties that people have. But the party is worth fighting for.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet this week we saw some primaries in-- in Florida, in Arizona where those running on the Republican ticket seem to have to pass a test-- a loyalty test to-- to Trumpism. And that kind of contradicts some of the Conservative party you're describing.  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: Unfortunately, our party is shrinking. We're-- we're now down to about twenty-five percent. It's all becoming like a remnant. Parties go through this. But the party has shrunk and in my state and in my community and in my district we had a congressional race that the Republican who took my place was able to win by 17 points. Just a couple of weeks ago he won by the skin of his teeth. And I talked to him the other day. I'm proud of him. He's saying that the tariffs are a bad idea. He's also beginning to say-- you know what he said, he said turn off the television, don't listen to all the talk television and get let us get together as Americans. I was proud of him.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You endorsed him, President Trump endorsed him--  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --as well.  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: I did because I work with him in the legislature and I saw him during the campaign articulate some views that I hope was-- were going to be independent. But there are Republicans I'm not campaigning for. They're just-- I just won't do it because if you're a divider and if you can't see the fact that we need to unify people then I can't be for you. I mean, nothing personal. I just can't help you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you campaign for Balderson in November, when he has to--  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: I don't think it'll be a problem. I mean he's off to a good start and the ra-- and the district is so overwhelmingly Republican. That was what's so shocking about the closeness of the race. He's going to be fine.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But the--  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: But there are so many other places where Democrats will use their resources and by the way they need to get their act together. You know, we spend so much time talking about how lost the Republicans are. But you think about the Democratic Party moving farther and farther to the left. That's not-- our country is center right or center left. It's not on the extremes. Your political party shouldn't matter so much. Vote for the person.  MARGARET BRENNAN: If you were to run yourself in 2020, as many are saying you might, you would still run as a Republican? Not as an independent. Not as another voice out there.  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: I-- I-- I'm a Republican.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The party is worth saving, you're saying?  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: Well, I'm going to do my level best. But at the end I worry about my country. I worry about my country being a great leader in the world, not more conflict which can lead to-- let's not even go there. I want my country where the people that live in this country, whoever they are, to feel as though they have a hope, they're respected and they can be successful. That to me is what it is really all about.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Last question. You knelt in front of John McCain's coffin at the Capitol. What were you thinking?  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: Well, I had a word with John. I said \"John, you remember I called you when you were sick and I asked you if you were okay with the big guy? And I said-- said John, I'll see you up there someday. Keep a place open for me, would you?\" Then I got up and-- and left.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you.  GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Also among those who mourned John McCain yesterday, his old friend former Senate colleague John Kerry. We spoke with him earlier this summer prior to McCain's death about what Kerry hoped to do in his new book Every Day is Extra.  (Begin VT)  JOHN KERRY (Former Secretary of State/@johnkerry/Every Day is Extra): You work to implement our democracy by reaching out across the aisle, by building relationships, by believing in the better angels of American value system. And I think John McCain did that. I did that, others have done that. But right now we have a culture divide that has been accentuated by political so-called leaders. And what they're doing is they're operating in a fact-less world. And my book, I think, is a-- is a display of the ways in which you challenge those who would try to tear it apart and not deal with facts and how you in fact can hold the system accountable and get back-- back to the fact-based democracy we rely on.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to be hitting the campaign trail?  JOHN KERRY: You bet I am. I think that's the most important work we can do right now is trying to elect people on a national basis and--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-  JOHN KERRY: --and restore the leadership that the country needs.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --how do you define what Democrats stand for these days?  JOHN KERRY: I-- I think each Democratic candidate is going to define it as they go out and speak to people in their districts, and out of that I-- I believe will come the future consensus that's necessary to take a party as a whole to a better place.   MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a party in crisis.  JOHN KERRY: Well-- I'll probably get smacked for this. But, you know, what I learned running for President is that you don't have a party per se where you have adherence to a strict platform et cetera. You have an amalgamation. You have a group of people who call themselves Democrats, but they speak with different nuances and different approaches to various aspects of political choices--life.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to run in 2020?  JOHN KERRY: I'm really not thinking about it. Talking about 2020 right now is a total distraction and waste of time. What we need to do is focus on 2018.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm going ask you that same question sometime after November.  JOHN KERRY: If you catch me.  MARGARET BRENNAN: If I catch you. You mentioned running in 2004 and you write a lot about it and some detail you hadn't actually made public before, some of the difficulties along the way.  JOHN KERRY: Yeah. There's a lot of-- I've never said anything much about it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you regret not fighting back harder against the Swift Boat attack ads?  JOHN KERRY: I do regret that-- and I say this in the book. I'm very clear, and I take responsibility for it. It is my-- it's my ultimate decision. I'm responsible for it not having happened. But, yes, I believe it was vital particularly in the last days of the campaign, to be addressing advertisements that were such a grotesque distortion of the reality of what happened in the rivers of Vietnam.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you regret picking John Edwards as your vice presidential candidate?  JOHN KERRY: I write in the book about the qualities that you are looking for when you choose a vice president. I think when you articulate those qualities and then you measure what took place against the qualities that I very much lay out there that you're looking for, it-- it didn't measure up. It-- it-- it wasn't what we had hoped for. So, there was some disappointment in that.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: When we come back, we'll talk to former Secretary of State John Kerry about his policy differences with the man he served under, President Barack Obama.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: John Kerry served as President Obama's Secretary of State in his second administration and the two men didn't always agree on foreign policy especially when it came to Syria.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about another key relationship: Barack Obama. Specifically you said, \"I never succeeded in persuading him to give me the tool I wanted most: greater leverage.\"  JOHN KERRY: Correct.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?  JOHN KERRY: Well, from the moment I was nominated and asked, \"What about Syria?\" I said we have to change Assad's calculation. And throughout the four years I was secretary of state, privileged to be so, I always raised the issue in the meetings we had about how we needed to change that calculation. I particularly believed that after Assad had been violating ceasefires. It was clear he needed to be taught a lesson. He needed to know that we were going to hold him accountable. And I raised that directly with the Russians, and I put several ideas on the table. The President was not persuaded by my argument. I believed that we had several options we could have done at very low risk to be able to make it clear to Assad that when we had a ceasefire and when he said he was going to live by it, he had to live by it. And I thought we should have done that. And as I--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Was he too risk averse?  JOHN KERRY: As I say in the book, my job and the job of anybody in a cabinet is to put an idea in front of the President, to argue the idea. The President is the decider. And there is no clarity by which I can say to you I was a hundred percent right or the President was a hundred percent wrong or vice versa. Those are the judgments that are made by a President.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think he was too risk averse?  JOHN KERRY: No, I think he had an attitude about Syria and a judgment about Syria. And he had a feeling about where that might take him if he made some of the decisions that I and others proffered.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you write about this in detail. It's an entire chapter in the book--  JOHN KERRY: I do.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --because you, to be very frank, were hung out to dry here because you went on television--  JOHN KERRY: I don't write that. I don't say I was hung out to dry and you know that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: No, that's my characterization. I know that.  JOHN KERRY: You're characterizing my--  MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm characterizing your retelling though, where you went out and you made this prosecutorial--  JOHN KERRY: What I write about is the degree--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --very careful argument about the chemical weapons attacks.  JOHN KERRY: Correct. And what I write about is we paid a price for the way it played out without the red line being enforced by the bombing. But we got the chemical weapons out which was the objective. And did it cost us?  MARGARET BRENNAN: Even though there have been chemical weapons attacks since then.  JOHN KERRY: Did it-- we knew there were precursor chemicals and-- and we knew that there was chlorine, which when mixed they still had ability. Those aren't declared. That's just the vagary of the-- system by which they measure--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But there have been sarin gas attacks since then, so--  JOHN KERRY: --chemical weapons. Yes. That is correct.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --under the Trump administration.  JOHN KERRY: That's absolutely correct. And I supported President Trump's response to those partially. I-- I-- I supported the use of force, but I don't support just a one-off where you drop a few bombs and there's no follow-up diplomacy and no additional effort to try to use the leverage you get out of doing that. I thought that the President should have done that, President Trump should have done that. And--  MARGARET BRENNAN: You thought President Obama should have done that, too.  JOHN KERRY: Yes. That's correct.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You were sent around the world to rally support for other countries to stand with the United States to say that this red line on use of chemical weapons needed to be enforced. How difficult was that for you given that the President blinked? He decided not to go through with those military strikes.  JOHN KERRY: Congress was clearly not going to give him the authority that he wanted.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you thought that the President could have gone ahead with those strikes.  JOHN KERRY: I did. Yes, I did. I did.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote in the book-- you write about being surprised when he called you and said, \"I'm going to Congress.\"  JOHN KERRY: I was surprised. I thought we were going to go forward. I thought that weekend was the weekend. I expected the phone call to be telling me that he had decided we were striking that night or whatever was going to happen, and it wasn't. My job was to then affect the President's policy. And I did the best I could in going to Congress and arguing the case. But I do write that we paid a price for that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  JOHN KERRY: There's no question about that. We paid a price. And-- and all the explanations and everything else doesn't change the perception. And perceptions sometimes are very telling in diplomacy and politics.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you paid a price. You mean, the red line moment has come to for many critics of President Obama--  JOHN KERRY: It's--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --define his foreign policy and define it as weak, as not backing up a threat.  JOHN KERRY: For many people that's exactly what I ran into. When I ran into that in the Middle East. It was something that I had to push back against for a long period of time. And that's why I say perceptions, but perceptions matter obviously in everything. But I don't think it's fair in terms of the President, quote, \"Being weak\" because the President took a lot of very tough positions and-- and did a lot of things that evidence strength and that showed a President who had a very clear moral compass as well as very clear a very clear-- a very clear set of values and principles by which he knew he could protect our country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm pressing you on this because you write in the book about thinking even now about what you called the open wounds in Syria, that you think almost every day about it.  JOHN KERRY: Well, the open wound in Syria is that maybe five hundred thousand people have now died. It's about a hundred thousand back in 2013 when the chemical weapons attack took place. It has been an ongoing atrocity, a violation of every sense of propriety, of human rights, of-- of diplomatic rectitude. I mean, you run the list of things that are at stake in Syria. It is a sad history for the international community, not just for the United States. It is the failure of the global community to hold a tyrant, a war criminal, accountable for his behavior and to have come together and tried to end the war. What-- what-- what I'm proud of is-  MARGARET BRENNAN: He's won that war now.  JOHN KERRY: What I'm proud of is that we continually tried. We never stopped trying. Even when it was tough, even when it looked bleak.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you took some heat for not stopping trying.  JOHN KERRY: Well, Yeah. We took heat right up until the end. But that's okay by me. Assad is in the driver's seat today because of what Russia and Iran, Hezbollah, have done. So, we have an open wound. Yes, a global, an international community owned open wound.  MARGARET BRENNAN: In those days, those very intense days when you were working diplomatically to try to build support to stand with the U.S. and if they were to go through with a strike. We were at that press conference in London.  JOHN KERRY: You asked the magic question, \"Is there anything that Assad could do?\" was your question.  MARGARET BRENNAN (September 9, 2013): Is there anything at this point that his government could do or offer that would stop an attack?  JOHN KERRY (September 9, 2013): Sure. He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week. Turn it over, all of it.  It turned out to be-- the way we solved a critical problem. It was done purposefully in order to put out there a notion without a formal proposal, just as an answer to your question which came at the right moment. And within an hour, I had a call from Sergey Lavrov, who said, \"Let's follow up on that. We're interested in seeing if we can make that happen.\" There'd been a dance going back and forth, and I write about that as to whether or not they could or couldn't do it. We're interested in it or weren't in it. But after I said it publicly like that, they took that as the possible off ramp and it turned out to be the way to get it done.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you regret that this is the diplomatic off ramp that you ended up with? That ultimately what you strongly believe should have happened didn't?  JOHN KERRY: No. What I regret is that there is-- that such an incredibly powerful perception gained a foothold the way it did, that had an impact on people's judgment about what the President was willing to do or not do.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Not enforcing the red line.  JOHN KERRY: Correct. That's-- that's regrettable. It's regrettable for everybody. But I-- I don't regret that putting, you know, the idea on the table and I think it was a terrific outcome in the sense that we got all the declared weapons out of there.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, because there have been at least two large-scale chemical attacks--  JOHN KERRY: Correct.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --in the past few years.  JOHN KERRY: Well, and during which time he's had an opportunity to reconstitute and gain a foothold and there's been no further inspection and nothing else going on.  MARGARET BRENNAN: In our next half hour, we'll get some thoughts from Secretary Kerry about the current President and Mister Trump's efforts to undo the Iran nuclear deal.  (End VT)  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Next week marks the unofficial kick-off of the fall campaign season and also the official kick-off of NFL football.  We'll be talking about both next Sunday on FACE THE NATION.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION including our political panel. So stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue with our conversation with former secretary, John Kerry.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: You spent a tremendous amount of time working to get this deal with Iran for them to freeze their nuclear program. President Trump said it's the worst deal he's ever seen.  JOHN KERRY: Yeah. But just saying that doesn't make it that. This is the toughest agreement in terms of inspection, accountability. No country has had to do what Iran did in order to live up to this, but to just walk away while Russia, China, France, Germany, and Britain are all trying to keep this agreement in place. Only the United States walked away, only Donald Trump. His defense secretary thought he should keep it. The Secretary of State that he got rid of thought he should keep it. His intelligence people thought he should keep it. The fact is this agreement is working and now it's working without the United States.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you tried to save this deal--  JOHN KERRY: Yes, I did.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --behind the scenes.  JOHN KERRY: Well, I try--  MARGARET BRENNAN: And that really angered President Trump. You were calling other foreign ministers. You even spoke with Javad Zarif--  JOHN KERRY: Well, at that point in time--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --the Iranian foreign minister.  JOHN KERRY: --the policy of the United States was still to support that agreement.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President thought you were trying to undermine him.  JOHN KERRY: No. I was trying to have the policy of the United States of America which was part of the agreement to continue and common sense to continue. I didn't negotiate. I spoke out, and I will always exercise my right to speak out.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But President Trump would say he was elected on a platform of exiting this deal. And he went out and attacked you personally because of the phone calls you were making.  JOHN KERRY: I-- I-- I-- I don't put any stock in-- in-- in that at all.  MARGARET BRENNAN: He said, \"John Kerry never walked away from the table except to be in that bicycle race where he fell and broke his leg. That's it.\"  JOHN KERRY: I did walk away. And we almost walked away on two or three other occasions where we thought it was necessary. So, he'd really, unfortunately-- and I say this sadly-- you know, more often than not he really just doesn't know what he's talking about. He makes things up, and he's making that up as he has other things.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Didn't you want to say something at the time? Tweet back at him, at President Trump when he attacks you?  JOHN KERRY: I haven't yet. I think America and our democracy are more thoughtful than dishonest tweets.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think President Trump's unpredictability is or can be an asset?  JOHN KERRY: I would never say no to that. But unpredictability that destroys seventy years of a-- a strongly defended message such as NATO, or unpredictability with respect to what your policy is with respect to nuclear weapons or disarmament or whatever or Russia is not a good thing. There are certain times where unpredictability invites an overreach by a country.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Our full interview with Secretary Kerry is available on our website, FaceTheNation.com. Secretary Kerry's book was published by Simon & Schuster, which we should mention is a division of CBS.  Joining us now for some political analysis, Edward Wong is a diplomatic and international correspondent for the New York Times. Salena Zito reports for The Washington Examiner, is a columnist for the New York Post and is also a CNN contributor. Margaret Talev is the senior White House correspondent for Bloomberg News, she's also a CNN political analyst. And Kelsey Snell is a congressional reporter for NPR. Welcome to FACE THE NATION. Ed, let's start off with you. Secretary Kerry there basically laying out his regrets about Syria. We know today the secretary of state now, Mike Pompeo, is warning three million people are at risk in Idlib, Syria of imminent disaster. The Pope is warning about this, the U.N. is warning about this. What is the Trump administration doing about it?  EDWARD WONG (The New York Times/@comradewong): Well, the Trump administration officials say that the various people like Pompeo, Mattis have spoken to their counterparts and to Russian officials about this. But if you look at the Trump policy, it's not that different than Obama's policy. And so far we haven't seen any action that would really push back against a large Assad military action or backed by Russians and by Iranians. And so I think that Assad won't feel a compunction to really hold back. I think Idlib province is the very last holdout of the rebels, and he's going to push ahead with whatever offensive he has lined up.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, despite the tough rhetoric against Iran the group they're backing and Assad is winning this war and the U.S. is not doing anything to stop this slaughter.  EDWARD WONG: Right. I think that we saw Trump do a symbolic action earlier in his administration, he fired the missiles on the airfield in Syria, but that didn't hold Assad back. And unless there are tougher actions on Assad and on his allies we won't see him holding back at all.  MARGARET TALEV (Bloomberg News/@margarettalev): But they have warned, right, that they're willing to do that. And Bolton sent that message very clear to--  MARGARET BRENNAN: If there's use of chemical weapons.  MARGARET TALEV: If there are use of chemical weapons, that it would be not just equal to but-- but more significant than the previous attack. But it really is in conflict with the administration's desire to get out of Syria, which they've also been trying to negotiate if possible if the Russians are willing to make commitments about Iran. So, these are two policy goals and-- and real conflict.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Now I had a former Obama administration official say to me, policy is not that different, we just felt bad about it, which is an incredibly cynical way of-- of looking at what is happening on the ground right now. Margaret, I want to ask you just right off the top, the publication you work for Bloomberg News, you just had extended sit down with President Trump.  MARGARET TALEV: It was amazing.  MARGARET BRENNAN: It-- well, and-- and it sparked its own controversy the President now attacking Bloomberg for what he is claiming was leak of off the record information. Bloomberg's denied it. The reporter who printed it came from a different publication. You have not violated that off the record standard in the course of your comments I know. But what can you explain to us about what happened?  MARGARET TALEV: And I should also add the Canadian reporter also has said that without identifying who his source is, it wasn't us. So, we had an interview with the President, we had talked to the White House and said, our readers have big interest in the economy, we'd love to do this going into the Labor Day weekend. And they granted us an interview, we were supposed to go about twenty minutes, the President said he was feeling intellectually stimulated and so we were thrilled to get about doubled the time. We had forty-five, fifty minutes in the Oval Office with him and we covered, you know, the waterfront basically everything from NAFTA, to North Korea, to Jeff Sessions, and midterm politics. And on the subject of NAFTA, what he told us on the record was that maybe they get a deal with the Canadians by the next day, by Friday, maybe it would be in sort of the near future but either way he was convinced that the Canadians will come along. I have no idea how the Canadian reporter got any information that he published and because we honor off the record agreements, I can't talk about what the President might have said off the record.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, you have a transcript of the full conversation and the White House has a transcript of the full interview.  MARGARET TALEV: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, those are the two places where record exists.  MARGARET TALEV: Those are.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The specific place that the President confirmed these off the record comments, because he tweeted about them, the specific area was about NAFTA.  MARGARET TALEV: That's right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Policy-wise, where are we with that? Because just yesterday the President let off a flurry of tweets saying he might, after all, withdraw from the agreement that his administration says he had intended to sign on to again.  MARGARET TALEV: Yeah. The President and the White House feel and say that they feel that they have the leverage over Canada ultimately going into this. But, as you know, they've set off sort of this thirty-day time clock because of the Mexican president, Mister Pena Nieto's kind of expiration date in office and they are trying to pressure Canada into signing on now to a trilateral pact or else forcing it into two pieces. And so, he's got basically until the end of September to get Canada on board, right, if--  KELSEY SNELL (NPR/@kelsey_snell): Well, yeah.  MARGARET TALEV: --to make it easy through Congress, to make this the happiest--  KELSEY SNELL: And not just easy, it's-- it might be impossible to add Canada later if they don't get the final text to Congress within the thirty-day window, that was started on Friday. And Congress has been telling the White House about this for some time so they're not-- this is not new information to the White House.  EDWARD WONG: What's interesting is if you look at domestic politics in Canada, there's not a lot of incentive for the Trudeau administration to really sign on immediately. I mean, they-- his sort of anti-Trump stance has been popular with the Canadian constituency and they also have a bilateral agreement on trade between Canada and the U.S. that they can fall back on.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And the reason this matters is because this is such key trade to so many U.S. states.  MARGARET TALEV: Absolutely.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And--  MARGARET TALEV: Corporate executives have been pressuring the President for a while now, keep this as a three-part deal whatever you call it or a lot of jobs including in the U.S. could be a risk.  SALENA ZITO (New York Post/@SalenaZito/Washington Examiner): I mean, you look at, you know, the-- the states that I cover, the Midwest-- west states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, they're all stepping back and looking at this. This is a lot of the reason why a lot of these voters came towards him and-- and how he conducts these negotiations.  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We're going to take a moment and come back on the other side of this break. Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back with more from our panel. Kelsey, let me talk to you about this sense of hope coming out of Senator McCain's memorial service. This emphasis, country over party, bipartisanship. We kind of get a test of that on Tuesday, right, when-- when Congress heads into session to start these proceedings to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Will anyone remember the sense of civility that they are being called to behave?  KELSEY SNELL: Well, we're already seeing on Twitter and from statements from organizations on both the left and the right trying to pressure people away from that bipartisanship. We're seeing particularly on the progressive side. There are a number of act-- activist groups who are saying that Democrats should simply walk out and not attend these hearings. That's not something that Democrats in the Senate really want-- they don't want that pressure because they say they take this very seriously. And the process of confirming a justice who will have a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is something where they want to be in the room. But again, progressive activists are aghast about this argument, about not just the documents. There has been a big fight I'm sure as we've discussed in the past that they want more documents related to Kavanaugh's time in public service, particularly his time in the White House. And Democrats say they haven't received enough and Republicans say they've gone far out of their way to make sure that they produce more documents than any other justice nominee has ever-- you know, they'd ever seen. This fight is really gearing up progressives, and they feel like they are losing a battle against, you know, filling the court. And they--they-- they worry that the Trump administration is putting a stamp on not just the Supreme Court, but the lower courts for generations to come.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And talking about walking out, because basically when it comes to votes this is a fait accompli.  KELSEY SNELL: It's not--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans have the-- the numbers, right?  KELSEY SNELL: It's not clear yet. There are a number of people who have not yet said how they are going to vote, Republicans like to think that it's a fait accompli, but progressives say that they could still pressure some people in the middle to change their minds if that they are-- if they're able to kind of get the public more engaged.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Mm. Salena, how much does this resonate with the voters you talked to?  SALENA ZITO: In-- well, for a lot of voters, in particular, evangelical voters, the decision-- their decision to finally vote for President Trump was on the Supreme Court. The-- the-- his ability to pick someone for-- that's conservative for the Supreme Court. He put that federalist list out when he was running, and this is where a lot of them, you know, held back-- went from their reservations to, okay, I'm going to vote for this guy. They're very energized and excited about this. This is something they're going to be watching, and-- and I will say I think one of the most vibrant things that we do in Congress is to watch the, you know, I'm old enough to remember like the Bork, you know, when-- when Bork-- Judge Bork went through the process. These are one of the most vibrant things that-- that-- that Congress does. But, you know, Trump voters are going to be watching this, they're excited about it and they're hopeful that-- that he gets across. And I think it actually helps entice some voters who are going to stay home in November because they're exhausted to maybe come back out, because they got that win that they wanted.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Margaret, is some something that the White House feels confident that they can get those votes?  MARGARET TALEV: I think on balance they do. I mean Brett Kavanaugh is well within the mainstream of conservative background judges. He's served for a long time in the Bush administration. There are a lot of documents available about him. He is someone who you could see being nominated by a different mainstream Republican president. And-- and part of the question about privilege really does go to his time inside the White House, there is a pretty long-standing pattern of privilege. Also as a side note, mister-- there is a lawyer named Bill Burck, who's getting a ton of work as he's the President Bush's lawyer as well as Don McGahn's lawyer--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  MARGARET TALEV: --as well as a bunch of the lawyers for former--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Steve Bannon's lawyer, right?  MARGARET TALEV: Yes. The administration officials who may now be the target of other stuff. So, but, look, even so, it's obviously incredibly important to the President to get this done, and there are a lot of people that he's glad to be done with who will be gone also after this confirmation over those political reasons as well as the-- the prize of the court. And after all he's the President, he won an election, elections has consequences.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.  MARGARET TALEV: He has the power to fill spots on the Supreme Court when they come open.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Salena, I put Margaret on the-- on the hot seat at the get-to. I'm going to ask you personally as well to respond to what has been some criticism of your journalism. The Huffington Post coming out with an article specifically about you saying you didn't identify a Republican in a story specifically as Republican official and called into question a lot of your work. I'd like to give you the opportunity to respond to that.  SALENA ZITO: Sure. As you can imagine this has been an interesting week for me. It all began through a series of tweets by an anonymous troll. And as the internet goes, it just expands and expands and expands. I addressed the questions that were asked to Ashley and also I put my own personal tweet out there addressing each-- each issue that this anonymous person did. My editors have reviewed everything that I work for and all the places-- news organizations I work for and they stand behind my work and so do I.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you will be I think detailing some of this in the coming days--  SALENA ZITO: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --beyond this conversation here. You also, though, have-- have touched on or you-- you mentioned some of the social media outcry. There's been this outcry and some fund-raising on behalf of Republican congressman, particularly Kevin McCarthy on this idea that social media companies are censoring conservatives.  SALENA ZITO: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there anything to that that you have experienced?  SALENA ZITO: Sure. I had a story that I wrote for the New York Post a day or so-- a day or two after Cohen and Manafort had their, you know, lovely little legal issues come out where I went out and I-- I talked to Trump voters to see, does this change you, does this take you away? And within twenty-four-- I wrote the story, I posted it and in the morning it was gone. There was a notice that said it did not meet Facebook's community standards. Received a flurry of direct messages and-- and e-mails and so forth from people who also posted the story and said, hey, I put your story up and it's gone. It's marked as spam or again not me meeting community standards. So-- and-- and that was just a straight story. But the New York Post is considered a conservative publication, I work for two conservative news organizations along with The Washington Examiner and there is that impression that that happened.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And social media companies deny that there is censorship. Kelsey, there's going to be some hearings, though, with--  KELSEY SNELL: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --the Twitter CEO in particular answering questions this coming week.  KELSEY SNELL: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: How much of an issue is this going to be?  KELSEY SNELL: I imagine it's going to be a huge issue. We're already seeing telegraphs from many Republican offices that they expect to talk about this very directly with the CEO. I-- I would expect, though, that this may not get as much coverage because it's going to be happening at the same time as the Kavanaugh hearing. So, I will be interested to see how-- which-- which thing breaks through on that day.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, we had some mixed messages coming from the Trump administration on North Korea policy. The President saying he blames China for any kind of progress being stalled right now with denuclearizing North Korea. Is there anything to that and are we stopping or are we continuing military exercises, because the defense secretary seems to be saying something slightly different than the President.  EDWARD WONG: Well, I think that we saw Trump then rebut any idea that there might be reopening military exercises that came out and said on Twitter that military exercises are still on hold right now. And I think that that will be the policy until it changes. The--  KELSEY SNELL: Well said.  EDWARD WONG: --on the trade-- on the trade war thing about China I he's--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.  EDWARD WONG: --basically just trying to find the reason to sort of justify the continuing trade war which doesn't seem like it'll end any time soon. When I talked to Trump administration officials, they say that China has actually been (INDISTINCT) of sanctions on North Korea, Chinese banks have not violated the sanctions. In general, those sanctions are still in place. China is abiding by them. And so I think--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.  EDWARD WONG: --they're looking for a reason to explain the stalling on the diplomacy.  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Ed, thank you very much.  We'll be back in a moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Later today, Senator John McCain will be buried at the Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis next to his best friend, Chuck Larson, following a final private funeral at the Naval Academy Chapel. Following the burial, that will be a flyover in the missing man formation. This will mark the end of five days of events honoring the Arizona Senator. Here's a look back at the events leading up to today.  (Begin VT)  LINDSEY GRAHAM (Tuesday, Washington, DC): He taught me that honor and imperfection are always in competition. I do not cry for a perfect man. I cry for a man who had honor and always was willing to admit to his imperfection.  SEN. JEFF FLAKE (Wednesday, Phoenix, AZ): We asked for an added measure of thy spirit to be with John's sweet family who have sacrificed so much for so long in sharing their loving husband and father with us for these many years.  (Choir singing, Thursday, Phoenix, AZ)  JOE BIDEN: My name is Joe Biden. I'm a Democrat. And I love John McCain. I always thought of John as a brother. We had a hell of a lot of family fights.  LARRY FITZGERALD: Many people might wonder what a young African-American kid from Minnesota and a highly decorated Vietnam War hero turned United States Senator might have in common. I'm black, he was white. I'm young, he wasn't so young. How does this unlikely pair become friends? That's just who he is. Over the several years I had the privilege of spending time with Senator McCain, sometimes it was just a visit to our practices. Other times it was him texting and saying, yo, you need to pick it up this Sunday.  REPRESENTATIVE PAUL RYAN (Friday, Washington, DC): Rarely does this glorious rotunda falls silent at this hour. On a day like this, John would usually be bounding this way or that way right through here, visitors turning to each other asking, if that's who they think it is. But in this quiet hour we are left to ponder how his life speaks to us. This is one of the bravest souls our nation has ever produced.  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA (Saturday, Washington, DC): That's perhaps how we honor him best by recognizing that there are some things bigger than party or ambition or money or fame or power. But there are some things that are worth risking everything for. At his best, John showed us what that means. For that, we are all deeply in his debt.  HENRY KISSINGER (Former Secretary of State): None of us will ever forget how even in his parting John has bestowed on us a much needed moment of unity and a renewed faith in the possibilities of America.  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: One of his books ended with the words \"...and I moved on.\" John has moved on. He will probably not want us to dwell on it but we are better for his presence among us. The world is smaller for his departure. And we will remember him as he was Unwavering, undimmed, unequal.  (Woman singing)  (End VT)  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. I hope to see you next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0",

I am Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION.  Fighting a wave of negative publicity sparked by the release of a tell-all book along with embarrassing secret audio recordings, President Trump tried to change the subject. He revoked the security clearance of one of his harshest critics, former CIA chief John Brennan. He threatened to do the same with another nine national security officials he either disagrees with or fired. Among the dozens of former intelligence officials who swiftly condemned the President's action was former CIA director Leon Panetta. We'll hear from him. Our CBS News Battleground Tracker shows the race for control of the House could be shifting. We'll take a look at the critical role of female voters and the record-breaking number of women running for office. Two Democrats, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Virginia congressional candidate Jennifer Wexton join us. Congresswoman Kristi Noem of South Dakota joins us with the Republican perspective. She could become her state's first female governor.  It's all coming up on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION.  The President's efforts to silence his critics in the intelligence community has not discouraged them from demonstrating the right to free speech, as former CIA director John Brennan, former director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and former CIA director Mike Hayden, all appeared this morning in their roles as network contributors. We spoke earlier with former CIA director Leon Panetta, and asked him why he opposed the President's action.  (Begin VT)  LEON PANETTA (Former CIA Director/Former Defense Secretary): Security clearances are critical to our national security and decisions regarding security clearances ought to be based on national security issues. Our concern now is that security clearances are going to be used as a political tool to go after people that the President doesn't agree with or issues that the President may not agree with and we think that undermines the importance of security clearances particularly when it comes to national security.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House has said that there are at least nine others that are under review in terms of potentially having their security clearances revoked. It is the President's prerogative to be able to do this. Should it remain that way?  LEON PANETTA: Well, the-- the President, obviously, has power with regards to security clearances but his power is also limited by an executive order that makes very clear that when it comes to the revocation of a security clearance that it has to be based on national security issues not the politics of somebody, not what that person has said, not how they dress, not how they look but based on national security issues. This President is now going after people. And the indication that I saw is that he's-- he's going to provide these names to the press office to use this issue when it's a bad news day so that it can-- it can cover that particular news story. I think that's a real misuse of not only security clearances. I think it's a misuse of the office of the presidency.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But is there any restraint on being able to do that?  LEON PANETTA: Well, obviously, Congress would be important if Congress decided that it was important to protect the process for security clearances to take action. I think the-- the other issue here is that there is an executive order that's in place. It was signed by Bill Clinton. It was updated by President Bush. It was followed by President Obama. And this President has to abide by that executive order unless he is prepared to change it. That executive order lays out a process for revoking security clearances. And this President is not above the law he's required to follow that executive order.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you suggesting that this may not have actually revoked Brennan's clearance that this may not actually be a valid action?  LEON PANETTA: Well, I think there are questions raised as to whether or not this President has followed the executive order and whether or not he's provided a due process to those that are going to have their-- their security clearances revoked. Yes, President of the United States has power, but that power is limited by the Constitution and by the checks and balances in our system. I think the President has to adhere to those kinds of requirements.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You are a former director of the CIA just like John Brennan. So let's look at what some of John Brennan's statements have been recently that the President has taken umbrage at; specifically, he called President Trump's behavior alongside Vladimir Putin nothing short of treasonous. Do you think statements like that overstepped the boundaries of what's appropriate for an official of your level?  LEON PANETTA: Whether one agrees or disagrees with what John Brennan said is not the issue. We have something called free speech in this country. And whether you're a former CIA director or whether you're a former President of the United States or whether you're just a citizen on the street you have a right to free speech to say what you think about our country and our President--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But should there be a different standard--  LEON PANETTA: --and that's the right that John exercised.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Should there be a different standard for public commentary coming from former national security officials because of this blurring of the lines?  LEON PANETTA: Well, I'm--I'm a believer in the broad interpretation of the right of free speech in this country. The President certainly exercises it. And I think all of us have a right to exercise that. Now, if-- if somebody uses classified information or reveals classified information or misuses that in a way while he is exercising a viewpoint, then I think that crosses a line. But that was not the case here. John Brennan spoke according to his views of what the President was or was not doing. That in my book is what free speech is all about and it needs to be protected.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Panetta, thank you for joining us.  LEON PANETTA: Good to be with you, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the midterm elections. Our CBS News/YouGov Battleground Tracker shows that although control of the House is technically still a tossup, the contest is edging to the Democrats. And women voters are playing a critical role. There's also now a record number of women candidates winning their party's nomination for the House, the Senate, and for governor. But the number of female Democratic candidates outnumbers Republicans three to one. Republican Congresswoman Kristi Noem is running for governor of South Dakota and if she wins, she will be the first woman to hold that office in her home state. Good to have you with us this morning, Congresswoman.  REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI NOEM (R-South Dakota/@KristiNoem/South Dakota Gubernatorial Candidate): Good morning, Margaret. Thank you for inviting me.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we get to the elections I want to ask you if as a Republican you are comfortable with President Trump's decision to revoke and threaten to revoke security clearances on what appear to be political grounds?  REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI NOEM: You know, obviously, in this instance there was national security concerns. It appears that at times Brennan has put political purposes above national security. And I think what's astounding to me is realizing that there's over five million people in this country that have security clearances so there's a lot of folks--  MARGARET BRENNAN: What are the national security grounds--  REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI NOEM: --out there with important information.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --because the White House has not provided any detail as to any potential violations by Brennan.  REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI NOEM: You know, obviously, there's information the White House has that none of us are privy to. But I think it's important to know that the number one priority needs to continue to be national security and when we are looking at these types of situations that if someone appears to have put political purposes above national security then that's grounds for review.  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. What I hear you saying is you agree with the President. So let me move on to the election here. In your race out in South Dakota you said that when it came to your primary you think you actually lost a few points because of your gender, that sometimes Republican men are reluctant to put a woman in that executive office. Do you think that's a problem just in your state or is that a problem nationally?  REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI NOEM: Oh, overwhelmingly, in my primary we talked about my experience--my experience running businesses, starting businesses, serving at the state level and the legislature in leadership and then also my knowledge of federal policy and how it impacts our state. So that was really brought forward in that primary election. That's what we're talking about in the general. I think that as we look across the country women don't just want to talk about women's issues. We want to talk about everything that's important to our economy, to jobs, to our children's futures. And that's what we focused on in South Dakota discussions.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So what did you mean when you said that your gender cost you a few political points?  REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI NOEM: You know there's always a time when someone is the first person to be nominated in a state and to run and to be elected potentially to a leadership position in your state where-- where that's a new experience for people. So we had discussion on that. But, overwhelmingly, the people in South Dakota are looking for the best person to sit in that job that can provide the leadership to address some of the challenges that we state-- that we face. We are a very small state but that also means that we can be nimble and we have a unique opportunity here for some states and governors to stand up and address policies that will give us a testimony of what we can do in this country to put it back on its foundation.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think accounts for the fact that it is three times the number of Democratic female candidates who are running versus Republicans?  REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI NOEM: You know I think most of the time when I am looking at women running for office they need to be recruited. I often think back to when we were going to be electing a new majority leader in the House of Representatives. You know that night as soon as there was an opening I started getting all kinds of texts from men that were serving in the House saying, \"I want to be the majority leader. Will you help me? Will you support me?\" The next day I was talking about that--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is your party doing enough to recruit female candidates?  REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI NOEM: I believe so but I also think that across the country that we have folks out there who, you know, women tend to think I don't know if I could do that job. Men often think I can do that job in an amazing manner. So it's our perspective many times as women and political parties play an important role. Women oftentimes need to be recruited. They need to know that they are going to have some support there and that will help them on their path to victory.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, because you are a Republican I want to ask you about the President's language.  REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI NOEM: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: He has referred this week to a former senior White House official as a dog and a lowlife. Physically-- he often references physical attributes and, as you know, he's been accused by at least nineteen women of sexual misconduct. Does any of that make you uncomfortable as a member of his party?  REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI NOEM: You know, let me be very clear I don't think there's anyone that would say that they approve of any kind of sexual misconduct. And we've seen many important people in this country fall when they've gone through the judicial process of-- of that being confirmed. That isn't where the President is today. But I tend to not focus on dissecting the President's tweets or his language. I am focused on policies. That's what my job is is to look at solutions that will really bring relief to the people in my state, but also to people in this country. I worked very closely with the White House on tax reform. I was one of the last and lead negotiators in the House to deliver that and because of that women-owned businesses are better off today, women's incomes are going up.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE KRISTI NOEM: And that kind of results is what makes a big difference in the day-to-day lives of the people in this country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, thank you very much for joining us.  And when we come back we'll hear from two Democrats, including New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand running this year.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We traveled to Sterling, Virginia, this week to talk with New York Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Jennifer Wexton, the Democratic candidate for Congress from Northern Virginia. We began by asking why a record number of women are running this year.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: So you draw a direct line between President Trump's election and the number of women running now?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-New York/@SenGillibrand): Absolutely.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Based on not demographic shifts, but just pure protest?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Protest, anger, frustration, and determination to protect their families.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're running in a district that's been held by Republicans since the eighties.  JENNIFER WEXTON (D-Candidate for Virginia-10/@JenniferWexton): Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What you're seeing in terms of your pull-ahead in the polls. What do you attribute that to?  JENNIFER WEXTON: I attribute it to my-- my background. You know, I'm-- I'm a mom. I am a former prosecutor from the heart of the district, in Loudoun County. And I am a state senator who, during my tenure in the-- in the Senate has passed over forty bills.  MARGARET BRENNANBRENNAN: Why do you feel comfortable saying, I'm a mom and that's a good thing?  JENNIFER WEXTON: Because we bring great things to the table. As women we are able to check our egos at the door, and work together to get things done and deliver results. As moms, we are able to prioritize and multitask all the many things that, that help us as legislators. And we're able to empathize and understand the issues that our constituents are facing.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think, though, that in this particular race, it's kind of unusual? I mean, you're a woman running against another woman here, Barbara Comstock. Does that change the dynamic of the race at all?  JENNIFER WEXTON: Maybe a little bit, because we are both women, so we can't put it in that frame of a man versus a woman. But when you have a woman who is not voting in a way that helps other women, it's time to replace her.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You know there's a number-- a record number of women running against other women, in addition to just being, you know, out there in the first place and putting themselves on the line, on the ballot. Would you also attribute it to President Trump?  JENNIFER WEXTON: I think Donald Trump has a lot to do with it. I think a lot of women woke up after the November election in 2016 and realized that democracy is a lot more fragile than any of us wanted to admit. And that the only way we were going to change things would be to get off the sidelines and run ourselves.  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: The fact that Donald Trump has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual assault and sexual harassment alone has infuriated women enough to do something that they might otherwise have not done, taking the risk to actually run for office.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But all those things came to light, or were accused-- he was accused of these things when he was running as candidate?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Correct.  MARGARET BRENNAN: He was elected regardless.  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Fair enough. But, the response to him being elected, I think, is this overwhelmingly-- the overwhelming desire of women to be heard, to be counted and to fight back against what he stands for and what he said. He demeans women. He devalues women. He's constantly trying to harm our families and our communities. And so women, when they know their family is being harmed, they will run through fire. They will do whatever it takes to protect their family.  MARGARET BRENNAN: He would argue, as would the White House, he is not anti-women.  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: He's actually endorsed your opponent--  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I would just read--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --back in New York.  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I would just read his Twitter feed on any given day and you'll see he does not support women.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The President made that personal in a rally this week up in your home state of New York and when he endorsed the woman running--the candidate running against you, he also slammed you. You've been very tough on him. But he was tough on you and said that you basically had no accomplishments, he hit you for coming and asking and seeking campaign contributions in the past. How do you respond?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I think it was a very weak attack and, frankly, I was surprised it was the best he could do, um, but President Trump does not have a relationship with the facts. And as a New Yorker he certainly should know that I have passed the 9/11 health bill twice to give health care to our first responders and the families that live in the community. As the commander-in-chief he should know that I led the charge in repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell. So if he wants to come campaign against me in New York any time he's welcome.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you hear some of his criticisms, like his hit at you for asking for campaign contributions, as gendered?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Yes, that was, clearly, a sexist smear and it was intended, specifically, to silence me and--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Why did you hear it that way?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: --and the dozens of women who had just come out against him for sexual assault and sexual harassment and the millions of women who were marching against him since he became President because of what he said.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this week the President referred to a former senior White House aide as a dog--someone who had worked with him for years. Did-- what did you hear when he said that phrase dog?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I hear, again, a very sexist smear that's intended to demean her. He has--  MARGARET BRENNAN: He's used it in the past against men.  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: He has used racist words also over and over again. He is intending to demean and devalue a former staff member and he's done that to women of color over the many months that he's been President.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And, yet, as we say, he's endorsing female candidates in this race, his successful campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who is an adviser now, says that it's absurd to accuse him of being in any way sexist and actually says that she's being treated in a sexist way because she's a Republican and that her contributions aren't recognized by fellow women.  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I think she's wrong. And he can support women candidates who also don't share our values. Women are not a monolith. To assume they are is equally absurd.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that we're going to see more female candidates run in 2020?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I, certainly, hope so.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Does 2018 get replicated? Or is what happens in November going to decide who we see run against President Trump?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I think what happens in November is going to decide what our country looks like. I think this election is a referendum on President Trump on the fact that he doesn't represent most Americans. That his values don't line up with most Americans. And so being heard in this election sets the stage for everything in the future.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you see it as a test case for 2020 that there could be, again, the Democratic candidate, a woman?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I think you'll have many women run in 2020. I think you'll have a lot of diversity--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you run?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: No, I'm running for Senate. And I'm running for re-election in my state, in November, too. And I am running against a woman, too, which is--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: --a good thing. That is a good thing to have more women running, Democrat and Republican.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And if you win that re-election you're not precluding running in 2020 for President?  SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I am solely focused on '18 and I think all of us are.  MARGARET BRENNAN: All. Right, we'll come back to you after-- after November.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We invited Jennifer Wexton's opponent, Representative Barbara Comstock, but she did not accept our invitation to appear. We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a record number of women candidates but what's on the minds of women voters leading up to November? We talked with five women this week; two, who voted for President Trump and three were Clinton voters, although, one of them had supported Bernie Sanders in the same Virginia district in which Jennifer Wexton is hoping to replace Republican Barbara Comstock. We begin with President Trump and whether he respects women.  (Begin VT)  WOMAN #1: I don't agree with his personal behavior. I find it reprehensible. But I believe deeply that he cares for this country.  WOMAN #2: I feel that he is more in line with my values and my view of where the country should be headed in spite of the fact that his personality sometimes leaves too much to be desirable.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you seen anything positive so far from President Trump?  WOMAN #3: To be honest, no.  WOMAN #4: I cannot think of one policy that he has implemented since being in office that has been for women.  Can you think of one policy?  WOMAN #1: Absolutely.  WOMAN #4: Tell me, please. Share with me.  WOMAN #1: Tax cut. It meant for me about a hundred and fifty dollars a week-- a paycheck more and almost five thousand dollars in bonuses in raise this year. That has helped my company. We're able to hire more people. That-- and-- and for women we have the lowest unemployment in sixty-five years.  MARGARET BRENNAN: How many of you think that the President truly respects women?  WOMAN #1: I don't think it's a matter of respect or value. He hires a lot of powerful women in his business.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you feel he respects women?  WOMAN #1: I think he respects the talent of women.  WOMAN #2: Correct.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying, no?  WOMAN #4: No.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What-- what do you mean by that?  WOMAN #4: I do not think he respects women. I think that women for him they are a means to an end. I'm sitting here and-- and I'm-- Jackie, I am baffled. Talking to you has been such a delight and I feel as if we are in the midst of the Yanny and Laurel auditory illusion where I hear Yanny and you hear Laurel and I'm amazed.  WOMAN #1: And I feel the same.  WOMAN #4: I'm amazed.  WOMAN #1: You're a businesswoman.  WOMAN #4: Exactly.  WOMAN #1: You're benefitting.  WOMAN #2: So, as I.  WOMAN #4: I feel as if I benefit because of what I have put in.  WOMAN #1: Absolutely and that's the difference.  WOMAN #2: The key.  WOMAN #1: That's the key. It's not somebody else created it, it you created it.  WOMAN #2: Right.  WOMAN #1: But the environment in which you are in now there are people today that have jobs that can give you money for your services that couldn't do that two years ago.  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a different question than does he respect women.  WOMAN #1: No. But-- but getting back to it I don't think-- I don't think Donald Trump respects anybody but Donald Trump.  WOMAN #2: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Does he respect women?  WOMAN #2: I don't know. None of us do. Whether he does or doesn't we don't know what's in here or in his heart.  WOMAN #3: But he should.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Maria?  MARIA: I don't believe that he respects women at all. And when he chooses to tweet things out himself and there are recordings of him saying things you can't say like, oh, well, we don't know. Because we do know. Because he (INDISTINCT) out of his own mouth.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll have much more from our focus group when we come back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Here is more of our conversation with women voters in Virginia.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think here in Virginia of the idea that two women are running against each other?  IRIS: That's great.  WOMAN #1: Airplane food, hospital food.  IRIS: Oh.  WOMAN #2: That is not me.  WOMAN #3: I-- I get it.  WOMAN #1: I'm going to kill you, but neither ones are worth it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you made up your mind yet?  WOMAN #1: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to share it with us?  WOMAN #1: I will vote for Barbara Comstock. I will hold my nose.  IRIS: Indeed, that makes two of us.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And the three of you are going the other way?  WOMAN #2: Absolutely.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Wexton?  WOMAN #3: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And do you view that as a vote against Donald Trump when you go to vote for the Democratic candidate?  WOMAN #3: No, not necessarily. I live in northern Virginia like all of you, but I live in the Lucketts area. And I feel as if Barbara Comstock has not done enough to alleviate road concerns, I mean, just basic things that are going on in my community.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Iris, do you view this as a referendum on President Trump?  IRIS: The whole election? It prob-- it has been turned into that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you're casting your vote.  IRIS: No.  MARGARET BRENNAN: When you go into that voting booth.  IRIS: When I cast my vote I usually cast my vote for, again, the person who I think is most likely to represent my values and my principles and do good-- do good for the country or, in this case, the state of Virginia.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You all do think there will be a female President at some point?  WOMAN #3: Oh, absolutely.  IRIS: Hope so.  WOMAN #2: Eventually. I mean--  WOMAN #3: Eventually-- you know, I'm fifty years old and I'm thinking-- I thought that possibly in November of 2016, we would have seen the first female President. I am not sure that it will happen within the next ten years. I don't believe it will happen.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Maria, you're-- you're a millennial in the group, are you feeling motivated this November in a way that, perhaps, you didn't in the past?  MARIA: I think in a way, yes, I think that-- that the two-party system is so polarizing and I think that a lot of people of my generation agree with that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think you've all become more politically interested or active since President Trump?  WOMAN #2: I have. I know I have. My family has become way more political. My sister very introverted. She is out there, she's canvassing, she is creating her own PAC even because she is that motivated, and so am I. And I never really voted in an election. I wasn't registered to vote because I chose not to. I didn't want my data out there. Now I'm like, okay, have my data. I have definitely become more political. And it is polarizing.  MARIA: Yeah.  WOMAN #3: I've always been fascinated. I grew up in Michigan. My father was a very strong Union Democrat. And I was in middle school when the air traffic controllers went on strike. And President Reagan said, if you don't go back to work you're going to be fired. I-- I was ten, eleven, twelve, I-- I don't even remember. And my first thought was, well, if you don't go to work then you shouldn't be fired. So those were conversations that I really couldn't have in my household. I definitely think--  WOMAN #1: Absolutely.  WOMAN #3: --one size does not fit all. So I have always been more issue-driven.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the fact that a candidate is a woman or that she's a mother count as sort of a bonus for you, do you view that as a positive thing?  WOMAN #1: No.  IRIS: No. Not-- not in my case.  WOMAN #3: Not necessarily, no.  IRIS: Not at all.  WOMAN #3: No.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Gender doesn't influence whether you favor a candidate?  WOMAN #1: Never has.  IRIS: Almost never.  WOMAN #3: I'm-- I'm trying to think if there's ever been an instance where I've just picked a woman over a man and I don't believe that I have. I-- I think it's-- again, it's an issue-- an issue for me. It has to be--  IRIS: (INDISTINCT) voters, yeah.  MARIA: At this point in time really women in politics is still very young.  WOMAN #3: That's true.  MARIA: So as the time goes on and more women will have been political figures for longer, they're going to be stronger candidates. And so I believe for that reason that there will be a woman President, hopefully, in the next ten or fifteen years.  WOMAN #3: I-- I hope-- I hope so.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that Washington would function better if there were more women in elected office?  WOMAN #1: No. I-- I think that-- I think that the swamp is so ingrained.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So none of you think that women act differently as leaders?  WOMAN #2: They do act differently as leaders. I-- I've been an-- I am actually under a woman, several layers of women leadership, it's amazing. And I am in the IT field. And that's what makes it even better. They are strong and they are candid and they actually care like they really do care. But I think that when you get to Congress, what ends up happening it's becomes-- it's a job. Like it's-- it's a job. You do-- they forget their constituency, they do the same thing that any other a man, senator or a male--  WOMAN #3: They can be just as perfect.  MARGARET BRENNAN: If there were more women, because the number is still relatively small. Would that change?  WOMAN #3: I think so.  WOMAN #2: It might change. It might change. I was in the military, right? And when we-- it was female, in that, and so when we were all together it was-- and when you have that camaraderie you actually build each other up and you make each other stronger but we all have the same goal, right? We were all going for the same goal. It's not the same in Congress. You're not all going for the same goal because you represent different people and their goals are different. So I don't think that it would-- it would be more. But I do agree with Maria if the more women that are in there, the stronger that they will be.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do all of you think that women are in a better place now than they were in 2016?  WOMAN #1: I do.  WOMAN #2: No. I don't think anyone is actually better. I-- I really don't. Especially when you're looking at friends and they say something and you're like, oh, you are that type of supporter? And then-- and then that-- that just puts a distance between you, right? So no one is better. Women or men, children, nobody is better. Animals, they're not better either. Nobody's better. Sorry.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, ladies, very much.  IRIS: Oh, it's been a pleasure.  WOMAN #2: Oh, appreciate it.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with our panel. So stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with our political panel. Leslie Sanchez is a Republican strategist and CBS News political contributor. Ed O'Keefe is our political correspondent here at CBS. Amy Walter is the national editor of the Cook Political Report. And Anthony Salvanto is our director of elections and surveys and he's here today with a batch of new poll numbers from the CBS News Battleground Tracker. So, Anthony, what has changed this summer?  ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS/Where Did You Get This Number?): The Democrats have moved into a stronger position to take back the House. We had them earlier this summer getting just over that magic number of two hundred and eighteen. That's the number of seats you need to-- to take the House. Here we have them inching up to two hundred and twenty-two. But I need to caution here, there's a margin of error around that, like there is with any poll on this estimate. And that margin of error still has a range where the Republicans could still hold the House. There are scenarios where that happened-- where that happens. What I want to emphasize is within that estimate all these districts are very close and we're looking at very small swings among these voters just a few more Republican women who are a little bit hesitant to say that they're going to back the Republican candidate. A lot of enthusiasm among Democrats but some who haven't voted before and so there's a lot of moving parts still here underneath that edge towards the Dems.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned women, as a voting bloc, they don't all go in the same direction, but you are starting to see a real shift in how women are voting this election.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. One of the biggest breaks is if you look at the college-non-college difference and we've-- we started to see this in the last presidential election and in these districts, it's really important, there's a double-digit edge for Democrats among women with college degrees here. And they also tell us that they are more likely to say their vote is, as you heard in-- in your panel, a vote against the President. And that's different from men who are more inclined to say they're voting in support of the President. And I should emphasize, these battleground districts are battlegrounds because they have relatively more college graduate women in them, so by definition that's part of what's going on.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. And, Leslie, I guess the question then is for these college-educated women who maybe in the past have voted Republican, are they comfortable crossing over in this election or do they stay in a partisan sort of position when they go to the voting booth?  LESLIE SANCHEZ (CBS News Political Contributor/@LeslieSanchez): Sure. So the President won about forty percent of those college educated. I always look at the other side, sixty percent of non-college educated. White women particularly were the ones that voted. So if you look at the pool, if they were white women they were more inclined to vote for the President. So the-- the dividing line really does come on race. If you look at Hispanic women, African-American women or women who are Republican in marriage, like their married-- their-- their family votes Republican. That's where you are going to see more of dividing line. People talk a lot about the suburbs, maybe there'll be more ticket splitters, we talk about Barbara Comstock's race, can she hold conservative Republican-leaning college-educated women? I think they can. And at the end of the day, that more of these folks will fall on the Republican camp than the Democratic one.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And how much of that is a Trump effect?  LESLIE SANCHEZ: The-- the most remarkable thing I think that's happening, historically, and I know Anthony talks about this, you expect about thirty seats to be lost for the President's party in power. What the President's trying to do is defy history and, basically, say, can I nationalize my local Trump voters to support a local can-- candidate. If he can do that and get out to all those states he wants to get to, those last thirty days that changes this from a referendum which it normally is on the President's policies and his character to a nationalized election saying that we fear open borders, we have a strong economy, you have to keep, be patient, and wait for the long-term effect.  AMY WALTER (Cook Political Report/@amyewalter): And that's been the-- the challenge. Leslie brings up a really good point about who's more motivated to vote in this election.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  AMY WALTER: And we've been seeing in all these special elections for the House Democrats have been outperforming their traditional vote percentage. They have been turning out at a higher percentage and my colleague looked at the last special election in Ohio where you have a great combination. This is around the Columbus suburbs and the more rural parts of-- of Ohio. In the Columbus suburbs, where you're going to see a lot of these voters like we saw here in suburban Virginia, they turned out at about sixty percent of their 2016 average. Okay. So they were turning out at a very high rate for a special election.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  AMY WALTER: In the very Trump rural parts of the district, remember Trump went into this district and campaigned, the vice president went into this campaign-- this district and campaigned, they only turned out at forty percent.  ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Yeah.  AMY WALTER: So there is also a limit, and I think there is one voter in there, I can't remember her name, who mentioned about, you know, I'm going to vote for-- I'm a Republican, but I'm going to vote for a Republican but I really don't like Congress, right?  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  AMY WALTER: That's really the challenge is. Trump's success was based on the fact that he trashed all of Congress, including Republican members of Congress, right? He spent most of 2017 attacking Mitch McConnell, attacking the ineptness of the Republican-- Republicans in Congress to pass an Obamacare repeal. Now to go back into those voters and say, I know you like me, and you like that I shake it up, but I need you to vote for these establishment hacks in Congress that I keep attacking. That's a very difficult thing to do.  ED O'KEEFE: We were in Ohio in that district for the special elections two weeks ago and it was just fascinating when you speak with women voters especially. How many of them unprompted were saying I am here because of the President.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: Mm-Hm.  ED O'KEEFE: I am voting against the President. I want nothing to do with him or anyone who supports him. The polling backs that up. Something like what is it, a majority say that the candidate much share their views on Donald Trump in order to get their vote. We were seeing that vividly every time we talked to a woman in that-- in that district. And, you know, it-- it just makes you wonder if you're hitting that sixty percent-- percent threshold how this is going to-- and you-- you've talked about this. How much this is going to potentially scramble the traditional models that have been used to determine--  AMY WALTER: Right.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: That's right.  ED O'KEEFE: --how many people are going to show up. If Democrats show up in far larger numbers--  AMY WALTER: That's right. That's right.  ED O'KEEFE: --it totally scrambles things.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Anthony, we were just showing a graphic there that I'd like you to explain a little bit. What are the issues that make people show up particularly women? I know health care is something that polls very high.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: It keeps popping up, every time we give people an issue list, every time we say, what is going to be the determinative thing, even if everybody is not talking about it in the Washington, it keeps coming up in the polls. For women then we ask, specifically, what is it about health care and its costs, its cost and a lot of folks who say that they don't feel that the changes in the Republican Congress has made so far have either affected them or affected them for the better.  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's right.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: And I think that's one of the things when we talk about what voters are saying and doing versus what the national politics as in campaigns are saying and doing. There does appear to be a little bit of a disconnect.  AMY WALTER: There's a huge disconnect. We saw this in our own assessment of the ads that have been run through the primaries from beginning this year through the end of July. Democrats overwhelmingly talking about health care much more than they're talking about Donald Trump.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: You know I think that if anything that's always been a blind spot for the Republican Party they don't talk about health care, they think about-- yes, it is in terms of cost. But women will say things like I am not going to get to go to the good doctor now I am assigned to the bad one.  AMY WALTER: Mm-Hm.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: When they're talking about choice and doctors opting out, preexisting condition which we know Republicans and Democrats agree on but there is this kind of myth out there that all of a sudden that preexisting conditions wouldn't be covered if you went in and tried to change--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: --the current system. I think the other interesting part is, no matter what policy and that's kind of my question, no matter what policy you put forward is not going to change women's verdict on the President's flawed character.  AMY WALTER: Right.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: That is consistent. And we-- you know, well, what if he does this, and has more tax reform and does infrastructure, it's not going to matter on that.  AMY WALTER: Right.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And, yet, it isn't necessarily precluding them from voting Republican.  AMY WALTER: Exactly.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And as we heard from Congresswoman Noem, she seemed reluctant to directly criticize the President.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: Uh-huh. That might be more just because there's solid red conservative or solid Republicans. And the interesting part if you contrast that what are the Democrats giving them. If you look at a Gallup poll this week that talked about there is more of an openness and a more favorability for socialism than there ever has been for capitalism. That's the first time at-- since 2010 that Democrats are starting to see that in a more positive light. What does that mean in contrast to Republicans who are really much more capitalist-oriented, they like the strong economy. At least it gives them a place to go.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, I thought it was interesting in our conversation with those voters when I asked women about whether having more female representatives would sort of change Washington.  ED O'KEEFE: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And they pretty much said, no, everyone is a swamp creature once they get there.  ED O'KEEFE: It is. And-- and why I find that interesting is, in fact, if you look at recent congressional history there is some evidence to suggest that women actually are pushing things along. There was a period a few years ago where you had women either running or were the top partisan member of the budget appropriations, agriculture committees and all of those big bills were moving at the same time and they all got through with very little drama and all of those members said, part of the reason this happened is because women were pushing it along. We're more willing to meet with their counterparts, we're more willing to compromise, and-- and remain laser-focused on getting it done. So I would argue the reverse that, in fact, I think we have seen evidence in recent years that if women do get in there, and end up in positions where they are moving a legislation along things actually could get done a lot faster.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Anthony, I know when you are asking questions you're always very careful and specific in polling in how you phrase things. You asked about Trump's handling of issues that affect women.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And I thought it was interesting in that focus group to hear people define what they thought a woman's issue was.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard from Jackie, that Trump supporter, for her all it meant was the economy. That's human issue across the board.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right. Very purposefully whatever it means to you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Because what we found was that for people who supported the President and for Republican women. In fact, to your point, they said they were primarily concerned with how he managed the government. But for Democratic women it became much more personal, it became about whether or not he shared their culture and values, they told us, or even how he handled himself personally. So that can be an issue that affects-- that affects them as well. So sometimes you want to leave it open because you want to listen to people--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  AMY WALTER: Right.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: --rather than impose something on them and say, check the box, yes or no and, again, to sort of reemphasize. The differences here are subtle. We're talking about single digits between moderates--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: --and Republicans, all of which could and-- and very well might shift as we go on. But it defines the contours of what people are going to argue about is happening.  ED O'KEEFE: That hospital food, airplane food line I think is pretty accurate.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: It's-- it's pretty political.  ED O'KEEFE: Absolutely.  LESLIE SANCHEZ: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. We will be back in just a moment to talk some more with Anthony Salvanto about understanding polling.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: At CBS we've been lucky to be able to turn to Anthony Salvanto to help us make sense of polling and the science behind those numbers. Now Anthony is sharing his wisdom with everyone in his new book Where Did You Get That Number? And he's going to help unveil the mysteries of polling. Anthony, thank you for taking the time.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thanks.  MARGARET BRENNAN: It's an interesting read. And-- and you talk with that-- you know, you open with that pivotal moment on the night of the 2016 election when so many people started saying, whoa, the pollsters, they didn't predict this. They-- they got it wrong. What do you think is the biggest misconception, though, about polls?  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah, one of them is that. That it's-- that they're predictions. They're not predictions. You know, I don't presume to tell people what they're going to think. My job is to understand what people think now and why they think it. I think too often whether it's in the coverage of polling or even sometimes the way we talk about it we make it sound like we are covering a horse race and we're the scorekeepers.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We want the bottom line.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. People just ask, well, who is going to win? As though that single number, the leader in a poll tells you the whole story. Even today if we say, okay, the Democrats are leading in the race for the House. That doesn't mean they are going to win. It means that's where things stand now. And in a lot of ways, I think that's more powerful and a better use of polling, because when people ask how these things work, what they really want to know is who are these people around me? Well, you saw even in the panel where people were talking to each other, and say, well, I didn't know that about you or now I understand you a little bit better. In some ways when we see the polling and people are telling us this is what I think and this is why they think it. Those are the things that people really want to know so our job as pollsters you should judge us, well, you should judge us not on whether we predict the world but on whether we explain it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And people's thinking evolves with events and over time. You put an analogy in the book of polling and your grandmother's Bolognese sauce. Explain that.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. Well, look, pollsters have always said that what we do is try to create a microcosm of the country in our polling samples. And that's how polls work. Because people ask me all the time how do you talk to a thousand or two thousand people and know the whole country? I mean it's counter-intuitive.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: And that's a really good question.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And who are these people?  ANTHONY SALVANTO: And who are they? You know who do you talk to and how do we find them? So the example that I use is, well, you can do this with a sample and, you know, my grandmother used to sit around-- be there on Sundays and she'd make this giant vat of spaghetti sauce. And if we wanted to know how it tasted, it always tasted really good by the way. You know, everybody would get a bowl. And you didn't need to eat the entire vat of spaghetti sauce to know how it tasted. You were sampling it. Well, what's the mechanism behind that? It's that the meatball that you got tasted like the meatballs that you didn't eat from the vat or even the grain of salt were like the other grains of salt. Well, in a polling sample what you're doing is bringing together Republicans and Democrats and people young and old and of every different sort. So when people say, well you didn't call me for the poll, you didn't talk to anyone, you know, about-- you know that I know. Well, we probably talked to somebody like you and somebody who could represent you. If you're a Republican--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: --there are millions of other Republicans we could bring in.  MARGARET BRENNAN: As we're learning.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: As we're learning. So, you know, there's certain power in that that we can be represented in our views by somebody else who is-- who is like us in the sample.  MARGARET BRENNAN: How honest are people? Do they lie?  ANTHONY SALVANTO: No, they don't lie. And I think because, you know, most people are decent and honest they don't realize how much work it would take to lie. First of all, why would you spend ten minutes on the phone or twenty minutes--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you do talk about a reluctance to sometimes be fully candid about who you're voting for.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, reluctance in the sense of-- and I think this is playing out right now actually in 2018 as well. When we see Republicans today telling us that they are not necessarily voting for a Republican candidate, they are telling us that they are unsure. So they are certainly not lying, they're telling us they haven't made up their mind quite yet. But the way we should read that number even if it's just five or ten percent of them who are saying that, is, we should say, well, they're already conservative and they voted Republican in the past. So is that a group that we shouldn't be surprised if they ultimately come home and vote for Republicans? No. We shouldn't. And that's a way to look at polling as an entire dynamic of telling you what could happen in the world. So when people answer and say that they're not-- that they're unsure we take them at their word but we should also look at other characteristics about them and think, well, what might they do and what else are they going to decide on.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Watch them and see which way they swing. And we know you'll be doing that, Anthony, with these upcoming midterms for us. So thank you.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. We'll see you next week. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0",

The resolution\u00a0calls on the Los Angeles City Council and Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove Mr. Trump's star \"due to his disturbing treatment of women and other actions that do not meet the shared values of the City of West Hollywood, the region, state, and country.\" Mr. Trump received the star in 2007 for his work producing the Miss America Pageant and before he starred in TV's \"The Apprentice\". Since then, the street plaque has been vandalized several times and completely destroyed twice, most recently last month\u00a0by a man with a pickax. Austin Clay, 24, was charged Monday with one felony count for allegedly vandalizing the star and faces up to three years in jail if convicted as charged. Initiated by West Hollywood Mayor pro tempore John D'Amico and Councilmember Lindsey Horvath, the resolution cites several reasons for getting rid of the star, including Mr. Trump's views on climate change, his border family separation policy, treatment of transgender people and his handling of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. While the impact of such a resolution was unclear, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has\u00a0previously rejected calls to remove Bill Cosby's star, citing its historical landmark status and a policy of not removing stars over public backlash.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with national security adviser John Bolton that aired Sunday, July 1, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" We have a lot to talk about today on the Supreme Court vacancy but we want to begin on foreign policy with President Trump's national security adviser Ambassador John Bolton. Ambassador, it's great to have you back on the program. AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON Glad to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Washington Post is reporting that U.S. intelligence has new evidence that North Korea is trying to obscure and hide the number of missiles, facilities and other parts of its nuclear program. Have you seen any evidence that they're actually dismantling their nuclear infrastructure? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well I don't want to comment on that specific report. I-I don't really don't want to comment on anything related to intelligence I'd- I'd rather discuss it as a more general proposition. We're very well aware of North Korea's patterns of behavior over decades of negotiating with the United States. We know exactly what the risks are of them using negotiations to drag out the length of time they have to continue their nuclear chemical biological weapons programs and ballistic missiles. President would like to see these discussions move promptly to get a resolution. This has been the advice that China's leaders Xi Jinping has given us as well. So we're going to try and proceed to implement what the two leaders agreed to in Singapore, but rather than have a-a series of reports things are going better things are not going well, they are concealing this, they're not concealing that. Really it doesn't serve the purpose of advancing the negotiations. But there's not any-any starry eyed feeling among the group doing this that we're well- well, well aware of what the North Koreans have done in the past. MARGARET BRENNAN: How quickly will North Korea turn over its actual arsenal? I mean are they using diplomacy as a cover? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well certainly that's what they've done before. But the Kim Jong-un was very emphatic several times in Singapore he was different from prior regimes. Now we'll let their actions speak for themselves. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you were emphatic that you were different here as an administration, that the weapons are going to be handed over before concessions are made when you were with us last time. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Right. And we have developed a program, I'm sure that the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be discussing this with the North Koreans in the near future about really how to dismantle all of their WMD and ballistic missile programs in a year if they have the strategic decision already made to do that and they're cooperative we can move very quickly and it's to North Korea's advantage to see these programs dismantled very quickly because then the elimination of sanctions aid by South Korea and Japan and others can all begin to flow. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Within a year? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well what our experts have-have devised is a program that with North Korean cooperation with full disclosure of all of their chemical and biological nuclear programs ballistic missile sites-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That hasn't happened yet? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: We can- it has not. We can get physically we would be able to dismantle the overwhelming bulk of their programs within a year. MARGARET BRENNAN: Significant. I want to ask you though about the trip you just made to Moscow where you met face to face yourself with Vladimir Putin to set up this July summit with President Trump. What specific changes in Russian foreign policy are you going to ask him for? What is the goal? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well the goal of this meeting really is for the two leaders to have a chance to sit down not in the context of some larger multilateral meeting but just the two of them to go over what's on their mind about a whole range of issues. President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that in the president's mind this is very important because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. MARGARET BRENNAN: But right now Russia is blanket bombing southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well we'll see what happens when the two of them get together. There are possibilities for doing a larger negotiation on helping to get Iranian forces out of Syria and back into Iran which would be a significant step forward - MARGARET BRENNAN: Use force to do so? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: to do so to have an agreement with Russia if that's possible. This has been something that's been going on now for nearly seven years this conflict in Syria. But the Iranian presence now across Iraq and Syria really reaching into Lebanon and their connection with Hezbollah which has been an Iranian subsidiary from the outset MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're declaring victory. Has Assad won the war? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: \u00a0Well I don't think Assad is the strategic issue. I think Iran is the strategic issue. It's not just their continuing nuclear weapons program it's their massive support for international terrorism and their conventional forces in the Middle East and I would say there - this is something that the two presidents will want to discuss at length because I think President Trump's decision to withdraw from the misbegotten Iran nuclear deal, reimpose our sanctions begin to put much more pressure on Iran is having an effect on their decision making not just on the nuclear issue but on these efforts to extend Iranian influence around the region. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you think Russia can be a partner? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: We'll see. I think the Russians are always saying to us they want to cooperate on international terrorism - MARGARET BRENNAN: They've been saying that for years - AMBASSADOR BOLTON: \u00a0They certainly have in some \u00a0- in some areas going back to the Bush administration, we did cooperate. On Iran which has been the largest financier of international terrorism around the world. I think that's where the real issue is right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats who said very clearly in June Russia is actively targeting American society in ways that could affect our midterm elections. Did you tell Putin and his associates to knock it off. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: I had meetings all throughout the day on Wednesday including with President Putin and his foreign minister and his defense minister and his diplomatic adviser for about an hour and a half . That the election meddling issue was definitely something we talked about. And I thought it was significant - MARGARET BRENNAN: Now? Meddling now? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Yes absolutely meddling meddling in the 2016 election. And our concern about what they're doing in the 2018 election and what President Putin said through a translator of course but what he said was there was no meddling in 2016 by the Russian state. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very little happens without Vladimir Putin's OK. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well I think that's that's an interesting statement. I think it's worth pursuing I'm sure the president will want to pursue it. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think he means? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well I don't know that. I didn't have an unlimited amount of time with him. But that's very different from saying my view that there was no Russian meddling at all. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you see that as some admission on his part? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: \u00a0I think I think the president will have to pursue that further and I think that's one reason why he and President Putin need to have this conversation as much as I enjoy speaking with my counterpart in Russia with the foreign minister with others is that Vladimir Putin is the one who makes the decisions and I think our leader needs to speak with him MARGARET BRENNAN: On Air Force One this week, President Trump when he was speaking to reporters seemed to leave the door open to recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea saying we'll have to see what happens when the issue comes up in the meeting. Is the U.S. endorsing the idea that international borders can be redrawn by force. Is this actually a topic? AMBASSADOR BOLTON: No that's not the position of the United States. But I think - MARGARET BRENNAN: This is why it was newsworthy when he said it. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well I don't know that that's what he said. I think he's I think the president often says we'll see to show that he's willing to talk to foreign leaders about a range of issues and hear their perspective. President Putin was pretty clear with me about it and my response was we're going to have to agree to disagree on Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not up for negotiation. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: That's not the position of the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But saying we'll see suggests might be. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well we'll see. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that's shocking for our European allies - AMBASSADOR BOLTON: I don't I don't think it's shocking at all. As I've said the position of the United States is clear on this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right but is that open to changing as the United States position if the president saying the door is open. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: The president makes the policy. I don't make policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is so deeply worrying to so many of our European allies particularly going into this next NATO meeting, are comments like that. Things that show some kind of crack in the military alliance of NATO that is - AMBASSADOR BOLTON: I don't - MARGARET BRENNAN: The president is looking to be friendlier with adversaries than out allies. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: I think that's nonsense really. I think that's nonsense. I think what the president has said to the NATO allies, that has caused them concern is that he wants them to live up to the commitment they themselves made during the Obama administration - MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of spending. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well it's not just spending. But let me make the point that they committed to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense matters. It's not just a matter of dollars and cents. This is a collective defense organization. NATO's the most successful political military alliance in history. But if core members including Germany aren't willing to spend what's necessary for their own self-defense, what are we to make of that? MARGARET BRENNAN: But U.S. intelligence believes Russia is actively trying to undermine NATO. You understand why the president's comments spending aside, is undermining the European alliance - AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Don't say spending aside, don't say spending aside. What is the depth of European commitment - MARGARET BRENNAN: You are correct that past presidents have also said that is deeply troubling and they want to see more spending. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Barack Obama - MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly AMBASSADOR BOLTON: - in fact said that free riders aggravated him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: So I don't I don't think it's fair - MARGARET BRENNAN: But when the President - AMBASSADOR BOLTON: - to criticize President Trump for simply saying what President Obama said earlier. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. But in terms of redrawing international borders like with Crimea leaving the door open to that saying things that undermine the alliance in that particular specific way are very unique and troubling. AMBASSADOR BOLTON: I don't think that's what that comment means. There'll be a lot of discussion. There was discussion this past week at the European Council about the EU position on Ukraine. And this is this is a subject where there's been disagreement among the Europeans as well. But I want to come back to the question of NATO 's effectiveness. The \u00a0president wants a strong NATO. If you think Russia's a threat, ask yourself this question, why is Germany spending less than 1.2 percent of its GNP. So when people talk about undermining the NATO alliance you should look at those who are carrying out steps that make NATO less effective militarily. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be watching for that. At that summit with NATO and Vladimir Putin. Thank you very much-- AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Glad to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: --Ambassador for being on the show.",

            "article_content": "As valedictorian of his high school class, Ben Bowling thought a lot about what he would say in his speech at graduation. The high school senior from Bell County, Kentucky, stepped up to the podium and offered some words of wisdom for his classmates and their families. \"This is the part of my speech where I share some inspirational quotes I found on Google,\" Bowling said. \"'Don't just get involved. Fight for your seat at the table. Better yet, fight for a seat at the head of the table.' \u2013 Donald J. Trump.\" The crowd erupted with applause. Then Bowling interrupted their cheers. \"Just kidding,\" Bowling said. \"That was Barack Obama.\" The 18-year-old said after he revealed it was not Mr. Trump who said the quote, but actually Mr. Obama, the crowd quickly went silent. Bowling, who graduated on Saturday morning, said he \"didn't mean anything bad by it\" and thought the moment was lighthearted and funny, the Louisville Courier Journal reports. \"I just thought it was a really good quote,\" Bowling said. This valedictorian read a Trump quote during his graduation speech and the crowd erupted with applause. Then he interrupted their cheers.\"I'm kidding. That was Barack Obama.\" https://t.co/E0Q5VNNf94 pic.twitter.com/ASsxAcGOWF The valedictorian knew that \"most people wouldn't like it if I used it, so thought I'd use Donald Trump's name. It is southeastern Kentucky after all.\" Kentucky's Bell County, which is located near the Tennessee border, overwhelmingly supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential election, with nearly 80 percent of ballots cast for the Republican, the Courier Journal reports. Although part of the crowd was shocked that the \"Trump quote\" they just cheered for was actually said by Mr. Obama, some people thought it was funny. \"Y'all, no lie -- the valedictorian just quoted Trump and everyone cheered ... then he told us that it was actually an Obama quote. Best part of the day. I'm rolling,\" tweeted Alisha Russell, who was in attendance, the Courier Journal reports. Bowling's advice to any valedictorian who is going to give a graduation speech: be courageous. \"Try not to be too nervous about it,\" he told the paper. \"For the most part, if you've been successful up to this point, there's nothing to worry [about].\"\u00a0 And Bowling has been successful. The Courier Journal said he earned a 4.216 GPA and will be attending the University of Kentucky, where he hopes to study biology and pursue a medical degree.

            "article_content": "The Trump administration launched an investigation into whether tariffs are needed on the imports of automobiles into the United States, moving swiftly as talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement have stalled. President Donald Trump predicted earlier that U.S. automakers and auto workers would be \"very happy\" with the outcome of the\u00a0NAFTA talks. The White House said in a statement Wednesday that the president had asked Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to consider whether the imports of automobiles, including trucks, and automotive parts threaten U.S. national security. The president said in the statement that \"core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a Nation.\" The U.S. remains far apart on the talks over rewriting the trade pact with Canada and Mexico, with the discussions at an impasse over rules for car production. The initiation of the trade investigation could be seen as an attempt to gain leverage in the talks with the two U.S. neighbors. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that efforts to renegotiate the trade agreement could spill into next year. Nearly half of the vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported, with many coming from assembly plants in Mexico and Canada. During a meeting with auto executives earlier this month, Trump said he would push for an increase in the production of vehicles built at U.S. plants. He has also criticized European Union auto imports and tariffs and earlier this year threatened a \"tax\" on European imports. A person familiar with the discussions said the president has suggested seeking new tariffs of 20 to 25 percent on automobile imports. The person spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak about private deliberations. Trump brought a little-used weapon to his fight to protect auto workers: Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The provision authorizes the president to restrict imports and impose unlimited tariffs on national security grounds. The Trump administration used that authority in March to slap tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports. Until then, the United States had pursued only two such investigations since joining the World Trade Organization in 1995. Both times \u2014 in a 1999 case involving oil imports and a 2001 case involving iron ore and steel imports \u2014 the Commerce Department refused to recommend sanctions. Critics fear that other countries will retaliate or use national security as a pretext to impose trade sanctions of their own. Daniel Ujczo, a trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright PLLC, said the tariff threat is likely meant to pressure Mexico into accepting U.S. demands for NAFTA changes that would shift more auto production to the U.S. from Mexico. But he questioned whether it would work. \"I do not believe that it will have the desired effect,\" Ujczo said. \"Everyone knows that (the investigation) will take too long and has no chance of surviving any legal challenge.\" Trump offered a hint about the move earlier in the day on the South Lawn, telling reporters that \"you'll be seeing very soon what I'm talking about.\" He noted that both Mexico and Canada have been \"very difficult to deal with\" during the negotiations. \"I am not happy with their requests. But I will tell you in the end we win, we will win and will win big,\" Trump said before departing for New York. He said America's neighbors have been \"very spoiled because nobody's done this but I will tell you that what they ask for is not fair. Our auto workers are going to be extremely happy.\" Mexico has so far resisted U.S. attempts to get higher regional content rules in the auto industry and move production to higher-wage U.S. and Canadian factories. The U.S. has also sought to change NAFTA's dispute-resolution system, and include a sunset clause that would allow countries to exit after five years. The Trump administration has already missed an informal deadline that had been set by House Speaker Paul Ryan to get a revamped deal to Congress in time for lawmakers to vote on it in a midterm election year. Mexico, meanwhile, will hold presidential elections on July 1 and Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the leftist candidate who has led in polls, has said the re-negotiation shouldn't be rushed through and should be left to the winner of the election. If the negotiators fail to agree to a revamped version of NAFTA, the discussions could be extended into 2019. Trump could also carry out his threat to abandon the agreement that he has long railed against, throwing commerce among the three countries into disarray. Trump has sought to overhaul NAFTA in an effort to return auto production to the United States and reduce America's trade deficit. The U.S. has been demanding that a percentage of a car's content of auto parts originate in a country \u2014 the U.S. or Canada \u2014 with average auto worker wages of about $15 an hour to qualify for NAFTA's duty-free status. But companies have built supply chains that straddle NAFTA borders and changing the rules could disrupt their operations, raise costs and potentially put them at a competitive disadvantage with manufacturers in Asia and Europe.",

            "article_content": "Read more transcripts from Face the Nation\u00a0here.\u00a0\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: Today on FACE THE NATION: The president makes bold moves that shake up the stock market and the diplomatic world, leaving administration officials to clarify and clean up.  Fears of a trade war spiked in the wake of new tariff threats by the president and counterthreats by China's leader, Xi Jinping. Add to that President Trump attacks on Amazon, plus Facebook's revelation that 87 million users' data could have ended up in a firm working for the Trump campaign, made for a wild week.  We will talk to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Overnight, a chemical attack in Syria reportedly kills dozens and injures hundreds. We will have a report from the region.  Maryland's Ben Cardin, a top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will be here to talk about that and other news.  Then: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK: We know that we did not do a good enough job protecting people's data. I'm really sorry for that. And Mark is really sorry.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRENNAN: Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg goes on a mea culpa media tour prior to CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before Congress on Tuesday. But will saying sorry soothe what is likely to be an extremely contentious hearing? We will ask Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy what he plans to ask Zuckerberg.  Plus, we will have political analysis on all the news just ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan.  We have lot to get to today, but we begin with that chemical attack in Syria. Overnight, in the city of Duma, the last rebel-held town in the area just outside Damascus, at least 40 people have been killed in an alleged chemical attack.  We turn now to CBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams in Istanbul.  Holly, at this point, what can you tell us about the attack?  HOLLY WILLIAMS, CBS NEWS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Margaret, the videos emerging from this alleged chemical attack on Saturday evening show people who appear to be dead, but with no obvious wounds to their body, survivors seemingly struggling to breathe, especially children, and being hosed down with water, as if to remove a substance from their skin.  We should stress, though, that we cannot independently verify any of these videos and we cannot confirm that a chemical attack has in fact taken place.  Survivors, though, reportedly smelled of chlorine. That is a chemical that can be deadly when used in enclosed spaces. Now, the Syrian regime, via the state media, has denied any involvement in this alleged attack, as has its ally Russia.  BRENNAN: We know Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had said last month that it would be unwise for Assad to use weaponized gas and the Pentagon had prepared military options to respond. But is there any indication in this case of what kind of attack this could have been?  WILLIAMS: Well, Margaret, around a year ago there was large-scale chemical attack on the town of Khan Shaykhun in Northern Syria that killed scores of people and did draw a U.S. response, missile strikes on a Syrian regime air base.  There's an important distinction, though. That attack was found to have used sarin nerve agent. So, there are some important questions here. Will this be concerned to have been a chemical attack? And if chlorine was used, a chemical that is thought to have been used pretty widely in the Syrian conflict, will that draw international response?  BRENNAN: Thank you, Holly.  A senior administration official tells us the U.S. is near certain that this was the regime, but cannot be definitive, and said a U.S. response is -- quote -- \"near certain.\"  It is worth noting that the Russians have previously vowed to shoot down any missiles the U.S. fires at the Syrian regime.  President Trump tweeted this morning: \"Many dead, including women and children, in mindless chemical attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad.\"  We turn now to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who joins us from Los Angeles.  Good morning, Mr. Secretary.  As a Cabinet official, what can you tell us about a potential Trump administration response to Syria?  STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: Good morning. Thank you. It's great to be here with you.  We will be reviewing the situation later today. I expect to get an update from the national security team. And as you have pointed out with the president's tweet, this appears to be another horrible example of the Assad regime, and just incredibly targeted.  BRENNAN: And a military response is potentially on the table?  MNUCHIN: I can't comment on what our response will be or won't be. But I expect to get an update later today from the national security team, and I assure you they will be reviewing with the president all different alternatives.  BRENNAN: Sure.  On the issue of China, you said on Friday there is the potential of a trade war. How should Americans prepare for that risk?  MNUCHIN: Well, actually, I was very clear when I discussed. I said, our expectation is that we don't think there will be a trade war. Our objective is to continue to have discussions with China.  We want to have free and fairy, reciprocal trade. We're just looking for our companies and our workers to have a level playing field. And right now, we have about $500 billion of goods that we buy from China and they buy about $135 billion from us. So, this is one of the single biggest opportunities for American companies and American workers if we have free and fair trade.  And that's what the president wants. So, I don't expect there will be a trade war. It could be, but I don't expect it at all. But the president is willing to make sure we have free and fair trade, as you have seen his tweet already this morning.  And, again, he has very close relationship with President Xi, and we will continue to discuss these issues with them.  BRENNAN: Well, the markets certainly reacted strongly to the even acknowledgment of the potential risk here.  The president, as you said, is tweeting this morning that China will take down its trade barriers because it is the right thing to do.  Mr. Secretary, has China given any sign of concessions since Friday?  MNUCHIN: It would be inappropriate for me to comment on what our back-channel discussions are.  (CROSSTALK)  BRENNAN: Well, what is the president referring to, or is he just striking an optimistic tone based on his friendship?  MNUCHIN: Again, I don't want to comment on specific discussions and where they stand.  What I will emphasize is that this is really -- our objective is free and fair trade. We have been talking about this for the last year with them. It's actually just about a year anniversary since the president's meeting at Mar-a-Lago.  And I think the good news is, President Xi and President Trump have shared with the economic teams we have a common objective to make sure we reduce the trade deficit. But President Trump is prepared to defend U.S. interests.  BRENNAN: But, sir, because you know this has caused such nervousness in the markets, which will be reopening overnight, has there been any progress so far?  MNUCHIN: Again, we have committed not to comment on specific conversations. And we're not going to update specific conversations and what they are when there is progress and when there isn't progress.  You will know when we reach a deal there's progress. And that's our objective. So the markets have had a lot of volatility in general. The market is still up a tremendous amount since the election. And what we should be really focused on is the strong economic growth. The tax plan is kicking in. Our regulatory relief is kicking in.  Trade has always been the third part of our agenda.  (CROSSTALK)  BRENNAN: Right. And that's why there's concern that this dispute could disrupt that economic growth that you're talking about that Republicans plan to run on in November.  MNUCHIN: That's true.  But, again, let me just put this in perspective. It's only $135 billion of goods in a $20 trillion economy. And if we can open up their $10 trillion economy for us to compete fairly, this is one of the single biggest opportunities long term for U.S. companies.  So whatever happens in trade, I don't expect it to have a meaningful impact on our economy. And president has said, sectors like agriculture, he's prepared to defend.  BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about your colleague EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. The president said he's doing a great job, seemed to give him a pass on some of these questions about potential ethics violations.  Is it the official position of the administration that all of these criticisms are simply political attacks?  MNUCHIN: Well, I think, as the president said, Scott has just done a fantastic job on policy.  And, again, the president believes in clean air, clean water. He believes in proper regulation, just not over-regulation. And we're determined to be energy-independent. That is one of the most crucial long-term issues for the United States.  And as it relates to the specifics of Scott's situation, I can't comment on them, but I'm sure the president's reviewed it.  BRENNAN: You're sure he's reviewed it. Has he come to a conclusion? He did acknowledge that he was looking into these potential violations.  MNUCHIN: Again, I think his tweet speak for itself.  BRENNAN: So, that's maybe?  MNUCHIN: Again, I haven't had any direct conversations with the president on this. I have obviously had a lot of discussions with him on trade and the economy, but I know he's very supportive of Scott Pruitt's positions and what he's done there. Tremendous progress.  BRENNAN: All right, Mr. Secretary, thank you for waking up early on the West Coast to join us.  MNUCHIN: Thank you very much.  BRENNAN: We turn now to a top Democrat on Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Maryland's Ben Cardin.  Welcome to FACE THE NATION.  The president said that there would be a big price for this chemical attack in Syria. And he called up Vladimir Putin by name for backing the Assad regime.  In your view, would a military response be justified?  SEN. BEN CARDIN (D), MARYLAND: Margaret, first, it's good to be with you. Clearly, there needs to be response. There needs to be international response.  This is against international norms.  BRENNAN: A military one?  CARDIN: Well, first and foremost, President Assad needs to be held accountable for his war crimes. Senator Rubio...  BRENNAN: He hasn't been in the seven years of this war.  CARDIN: Well, Senator Rubio and I have introduced legislation -- it's passed our committee -- that would hold the evidence accountable.  We need to make sure that there is a proceeding started by international community to hold him responsible. This is not the first use of chemical weapons. Secondly, Congress passed very strong sanctions against both Russia and Iran.  The Syrian regime under President Assad cannot exist without Russia's support and the activities of Iran. The United States, the international community need to take action against Russia and Iran for what they're doing in Syria.  So, we need to take a pretty strong response for another use of chemical weapons.  BRENNAN: Are there any briefings planned with the administration? And do you think a military response is legally justified?  CARDIN: Well, I hope there will be briefing. Congress returns tomorrow. I hope that we will get a full briefing on the use of these chemical weapons.  Unfortunately, there's not a lot known because the Syrian regime has closed the area. So, we're not going to have the direct information. So, it will be challenging for us to know. Everything points to that this was controlled by President Assad, at the, again, violation of international norms, and there needs to be an international response.  BRENNAN: On Russia, you commended the president for his sanctioning of these Russian oligarchs and other high-ranking officials.  These include Putin's own son-in-law and former bodyguard here. But you did criticize the president for not acting faster. What do you think these punitive actions -- what is the effect of them?  CARDIN: Well, it's been long time since the president -- since the Congress passed sanctions bill against Russia, passed by 99 percent of the votes in Congress. The president was very slow to act.  But I think our main complaint -- going against the oligarchs was very important, a very important sanction. I really applaud the people in the State Department and in Treasury for taking this action.  What we didn't hear when these sanctions was the president of the United States saying, this is the policy of our country. I was pleased at his tweet in regards to the Syrian issue. The president mentioned Mr. Putin.  BRENNAN: By name.  CARDIN: By name. That was a significant change.  But he has not done that in regards to the sanctions imposed against the oligarchs. And he certainly has not done that in regards to Mr. Putin's interference in our own country.  BRENNAN: You helped author a law that provides oversight for the nuclear deal with Iran, along with your colleague Senator Corker, who has said on this program he expects the president to withdraw next month from that international agreement.  Do you agree with Senator Corker?  CARDIN: Well, I think both Senator Corker and I agree it would be a mistake for the president to withdraw from the Iran agreement.  If the United States violates the agreement, we are isolating America, not Iran, from the international community. By all indication, Iran has not violated the agreement. Yes, I disagreed with the agreement from its beginning, but this is an agreement, Iran is complying with it, and the United States would be marginalized by withdrawing from the agreement.  So, I hope that the president will recognize that we need to work with our European allies make sure we're in lockstep against Iran.  BRENNAN: Mike Pompeo, his confirmation hearings will be this week as he goes up for this job of being secretary of state. You voted against him when he stood up for the CIA director position.  Are you going to support him this time?  CARDIN: Well, I have had chance to talk to him briefly by phone. We will have a meeting on Tuesday. And then, as you know, the committee is holding its confirmation hearings this Thursday.  So, this is going to be very busy week for Mr. Pompeo. I'm looking forward to asking him a lot of questions. I want to make sure that he will stand for the values of America, good governance, democracy, anti-corruption, and use diplomacy as the head diplomat if confirmed.  And I want to make sure he will be an independent voice in the Oval Office with the president.  BRENNAN: So, you're open to voting yes this time?  CARDIN: We are going to wait to see how this week goes. Obviously, I have many questions.  BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about another committee you're on as it relates to the environment, a lot of questions about Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator.  CARDIN: Yes.  BRENNAN: There's some speculation that the president, even if he wanted to get rid of him, which he's made clear he doesn't at this point, that he'd have a really hard time finding someone and getting him confirmed for that role. Do you agree?  CARDIN: I think it would be a challenge.  There's so many positions open right now in the administration, and there's so many weeks left before we get to the midterm elections. I think it's going to be a challenge for us to get Cabinet-level positions confirmed, particularly one at EPA.  My main complaint against Mr. Pruitt was his policies, his environmental policies. These ethic issued need to be resolved, and need to be resolved in an open manner. And Congress has a role of oversight.  BRENNAN: So, you don't think he should be fired over these ethics...  (CROSSTALK)  CARDIN: No, I didn't say -- that's a decision that the president is going to have to make. This is a Cabinet-level position. It's up to the president of the United States.  I think what Congress' appropriate role is, of course, during confirmation. And we don't have a confirmation process on this. But the oversight of his ethics issues are certainly within the realm of Congress.  BRENNAN: All right, Senator Cardin, thank you very much for all of your insights.  CARDIN: Thank you.  BRENNAN: And we will be back on FACE THE NATION in one minute.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: We turn now to Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana. He will be one of those questioning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday.  Welcome to FACE THE NATION, Senator.  SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA: Thank you.  BRENNAN: Facebook has acknowledged that some of its search tools were used by malicious actors to obtain information, and also that 87 million users had private information shared with other organizations without their consent.  What do you need to hear from Mark Zuckerberg?  KENNEDY: I don't want to hurt Facebook. I don't want to regulate them half to death. But we have a problem.  Our promised digital utopia has mine fields in it. Mr. Zuckerberg has not exhausted himself being forthcoming. We had one hearing. Mr. Zuckerberg sent his lawyer, very bright, very articulate, could talk a dog off a meat wagon.  (LAUGHTER)  KENNEDY: But he didn't say anything.  And my biggest worry in all of this -- and I have many, many questions for Mr. Zuckerberg -- but my biggest worry with all this is that the privacy issue and what I call the propagandist issue are both too big for Facebook to fix. And that's the frightening part.  BRENNAN: Too big for Facebook to fix. Does that mean that lawmakers like you need to seek regulations to fix it for them?  KENNEDY: It may be the case. I would rather do it with Facebook and the other social media platforms.  Look, we have got to talk about the initial market. Is it fair for me to give up all of my personal data to Facebook and apparently everybody else in the Western Hemisphere, in exchange for me being able to see what some of my high school buddies had for dinner Saturday night?  Who owns my data? Do I own it or does Facebook own it? The service agreement with Facebook, it's written in Swahili. Nobody understands it. Should I have the right to opt in, as opposed to opt out, put the burden on Facebook? Should I have the right to erase my data? Should I have the right to demand that Facebook get my permission before it sells the data?  We all know that poison is being spread on social media, not just Facebook. How are we going stop it? And by the way, while we're talking about that, what is poison? First Amendment concerns.  BRENNAN: But this is...  KENNEDY: These are very deep issues. And they're bigger than Cambridge Analytica.  BRENNAN: They absolutely are. They absolutely are.  But some would say, look, is it really something that Facebook needs to police themselves, or should Americans essentially have known better, in that they're putting that private information out there?  KENNEDY: Facebook knows more about its business, its algorithms, its methodology than any of us in Congress do.  I'm hoping that Mr. Zuckerberg will come to the table and say, OK, here are the problems, here are some suggested solutions, let's talk it through together.  But, you know, some people respond when they see the light. Others have to feel the heat. And these issues are not going away. And let me say it again. I do not want to hurt Facebook. It's done a lot of good.  But how do we preserve the good things about Facebook while mitigating the obvious detrimental effects of it? It is a mine field in many respects.  BRENNAN: Facebook already said ahead of this hearing that they're going to start disclosing to its users whose information may have been -- they don't like the word breached, but shared with others.  And they're also talking about now requiring buyers of political ads to confirm their location and identity and display labels saying that these are paid-for ads.  What do you think of that kind of proactive action?  KENNEDY: I think it's a start.  But the first question that Mr. Zuckerberg needs to ask is, does he really know who is running on his platform? He doesn't.  Facebook's lawyers said they have 500,000 unique advertisers a month. I think that's probably wrong. It's probably much more. I don't think they know who is running ads and issue campaigns.  We need to talk about how we're going to find out. And, again, you're going to get quickly off into First Amendment issues as well.  BRENNAN: Right.  KENNEDY: I don't want Facebook to censor what I can see in all respects. But I do want them to stop the fake news. I do want them to stop people from running advertisements on Facebook that encourages the genocide of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma.  These are deep issues. They're not going to go away. And we're not going to conclude this in one hearing, and I hope that Mr. Zuckerberg will be forthcoming and frank.  BRENNAN: Forthcoming and frank. And if he's not, what happens?  KENNEDY: Well, we can do it the easy way or the hard way.  I do not want to regulate Facebook half to death. But we do have two major problems we discovered. One is the privacy issue. And the other is the propagandist issue. Now, Facebook needs to talk with us, frankly, about how we can fix that. And if it doesn't know how to fix it, which is my biggest worry, it needs to be very frank in that regard, too.  BRENNAN: I want to also ask you about EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. The president seems to have given him a pass in a tweet yesterday, signaling that he's OK with some of these reports about government spending run amuck and these other allegations of ethical violations. What do you think?  KENNEDY: Well, to Mr. Pruitt and other members of the president's Cabinet, I would say, ethics matter. Impropriety matters. The appearance of impropriety matters.  To the extent that you are, stop acting like a chucklehead, stop the unforced errors, stop leading with your chin. If you don't need to fly first class, don't. Don't turn on the siren on your SUV just to watch people move over. You represent the president of the United States.  All of this behavior is juvenile. It's distracting from the business that we're trying to do for the American people.  BRENNAN: Should he keep his job?  KENNEDY: Well, that's going to be up to the president. I know what I would do if I would Mr. Pruitt. I would call a press conference tomorrow and I would say, OK, let's talk about your criticisms of me.  BRENNAN: Well, he did give some interviews this week.  KENNEDY: Yes, but I would do a full-blown press conference and say, OK, here are your criticisms. That's fair. I'm going to stop doing that. Here is what I think is not fair.  But these people are hurting the president. And I'm not saying he's not a good person. But the appearance of impropriety matters. And you can -- you can't put lipstick on a pig. It is what it is.  BRENNAN: So, for you, though, the president -- the president and certainly Scott Pruitt have alleged that all of this is just politically motivated by environmentalists who don't like his deregulation policies.  KENNEDY: Some of it is. But all of it isn't.  I mean, he either travels with 20 security folks or he doesn't. He either flies first class every single time or he doesn't.  I don't know whether the allegations about his apartment are true or not. They don't look good. Why do you want -- in his position, why do you want to rent an apartment from a lobbyist, for God's sake? Stop leading with your chin.  Now, these are unforced errors. They're stupid. There are a lot of problems we can't solve. But you can behave. I'm not -- I don't mean to denigrate Mr. Pruitt, but, doggone it, he represents the president of the United States, and it is hurting his boss. And it needs to stop.  BRENNAN: Senator Kennedy, thank you for coming on FACE THE NATION.  We will be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: Coming up next on FACE THE NATION, we will preview the congressional hearings into Facebook's practices with the editor of \"Wired\" magazine, Nick Thompson. He's standing by in New York.  And on a programming note, be sure to tune in tonight to \"60 Minutes\" and Bill Whitaker's report on how Russian hackers were able to infiltrate state election systems in the 2016 election.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, so stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan.  We want to take a closer look now at the FaceBook data story, how it's affected users how the company is responding.  To help us do that, we're joined now by \"Wired\" magazine editor in chief, Nicholas Thompson, who's also A CBS News contributor. He's in New York this morning.  Good morning to you, Nick.  This is a very confusing story for a lot of people at home. What is the main question that Mark Zuckerberg is being called before Congress to answer?  NICHOLAS THOMPSON, CBS NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the most important thing he's going to answer is, what happened to people's data? What happened with Cambridge Analytica? What are you doing to make sure that doesn't happen again? He'll go up there. He'll apologize. He'll explain it. And then what's going to be interesting is what comes next. Is it just retributions, or do we actually try to figure out good tech governing policy because we haven't really had a debate about how to regulate these companies in 20 years.  BRENNAN: Well, that's what Senator Kennedy was just telling us. He's going to be one of the questioners. He said FaceBook may be too big to fix.  THOMPSON: Yes.  BRENNAN: Meaning the government may have to regulate it. What does that look like?  THOMPSON: Yes, and I do think there is going to be regulation coming, right? And there's certainly some regulation that will be very sensible, right? You should certainly regulate advertising on FaceBook, political advertising on FaceBook, so it meets the standards of political advertising on other media platforms. That's a good idea.  You should also probably have some kind of structure for privacy regulation, right? You could model it after what has been done in Europe to make sure that people have control over their data that that the companies have requirements to make their privacy settings very clear. That would be a good idea, too.  Once you get beyond that, and you get into specific regulations about speech, or you get into specific discussions about anti-trust, then it gets very complicated and there's a lot of risk.  BRENNAN: But we've already seen FaceBook kind of try to get ahead of these hearings. Tomorrow they're going to disclose to users if their data was shared, breached, whatever word you want to use.  THOMPSON: Yes.  BRENNAN: They're also talking about forcing some disclosures on political ads in terms of where that person or entity was located and who paid for the ad. Is that enough to sort of soften the blow?  THOMPSON: I think it is enough to soften the blow. It's probably not enough overall. There does need to be some government regulation that goes beyond what FaceBook is doing.  Facebook has announced about 20 policy changes in the last few weeks. They're very good changes. They do protect you. They do open things up. They will make political campaigns clearer and fairer. But there also is a role for Congress, both in setting specific regulations and also setting some guidelines for FaceBook to follow in the future.  BRENNAN: Is there truth to what -- Senator Kennedy was -- was telling us that FaceBook doesn't even know who's running ads on FaceBook. Is there truth to that? Do they really not know? They know a lot about users.  THOMPSON: They don't know everything about who is running ads on FaceBook, right. They didn't know that the IRA, the Russian propaganda group, was running ads on FaceBook because the IRA had hidden its purchases. But I think he was overstating that a little bit.  FaceBook does have a good sense, right? They -- people enter their financial information. They buy the ads. FaceBook now has lots of people monitoring them, looking for suspicious behavior. They've set up their AI systems to monitor for suspicious behavior.  So it's an overstatement to say that they don't know who's advertising. But there are certainly certain things they don't know.  BRENNAN: Well, they seem to be playing catch up, though, because none of these things stopped those buys from that Russian propaganda unit in the 2016 election.  THOMPSON: Yes. So FaceBook was caught totally unprepared during the 2016 election, and they are still paying for that, right. They stuck their heads in the sand. They were not paying attention to the fake news, to the propaganda operations.  Since then, though, they have adjusted their algorithms. They have hired tons of people. They are working very hard.  So, the bad guys are going to work harder at hiding what they do, but FaceBook is also going to work much harder at uncovering what's going on. So the odds that we have as much manipulation, as much chaos in 2018 or 2020 that they had in 2016, I think it's small. I think FaceBook is getting a handle on this.  But, yes, you're totally right, they were absolutely unprepared in '16.  BRENNAN: Do you think -- you've interviewed Mark Zuckerberg. Do you think that he -- he gets it now that he understands the weight of the outrage?  THOMPSON: I think that there's been a real education process for Mark Zuckerberg that began the day that Trump was elected. Because, remember, Trump's philosophy, which is somewhat tribalistic, is entirely different from Zuckerberg's philosophy, which is, bring everyone in the world together.  And so the day after the election, I think Zuckerberg started to realize, wait, did my systems do this? Am I responsible for this? And he's gone through a lot in the last year and a half. And I think you've seen a real education, a real evolution. I mean he's still making all kinds of unforced errors and mistakes, but I think that Zuckerberg is really grappling and I think he's understanding that this platform, that he genuinely thought could only do good for the world, actually can be manipulated.  And that's the story of the last two years. It's Mark Zuckerberg realizing that the tools he built can be used for ill as well as for good. And that's something he had not realized.  BRENNAN: One of his top executives, Sheryl Sandberg, tried to, in many ways, lay the groundwork for this testimony this week. She was all over news networks apologizing on Mark Zuckerberg's behalf and her own. How effective was that?  THOMPSON: It was fine. I mean, she and Zuckerberg have been apologizing --  BRENNAN: That doesn't sound very convincing, Nick.  THOMPSON: Well, look at the reaction to it. I don't think anybody said, oh, you know, now we're totally sympathetic to them.  BRENNAN: Yes.  THOMPSON: I mean public opinion is still completely against FaceBook. I mean and that is why Congress is going to be out for blood on Tuesday or Wednesday. If you look at the public perception of both Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and also at the company, it's terrible. The stock market is mad. The employees are upset. People are really upset at FaceBook right now.  So I think she said the right things. I think Zuckerberg has been staying the right thing. I thought his conference call with the media the other day went very well.  On the other hand, they didn't respond to this crisis nearly as quickly as they should have and they're still paying for that and they're still paying for years and years of sins.  One of the ironies here is that I think this Cambridge Analytica scandal has been a little blown out of proportion, right. What happened in this specific instance isn't quite as terrible as people make it out to be and FaceBook's not as much at fault as people make them out to be.  On the other hand --  BRENNAN: You're talking about the data scraping and the use by an outside application of this information without their -- the users' knowledge?  THOMPSON: Yes. That -- that particular scandal, it's bad, but it's been a little blown out of proportion.  On the other hand, FaceBook has been violating our privacy and not paying any price for it for 12 years. So in some ways this is the comeuppance for 12 years of sort of small, privacy violations and breaches of trust that FaceBook hasn't really been punished for. So they're being punished too much for this specific crime, but maybe the right amount for the accumulation of things over the last decade.  BRENNAN: It's going to be fascinating to watch, Nick. Thank you very much.  THOMPSON: Thank you so much, Margaret. Good to talk to you.  BRENNAN: We'll be right back with our panel.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: And now for some political analysis.  Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor at \"The National Review,\" a columnist for \"Bloomberg View,\" and a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Julie Pace is the Washington bureau chief for the \"Associated Press.\" Jeffrey Goldberg is editor and chief of \"The Atlantic.\" And we'd like to welcome to the show Toluse Olorunnipa to the broadcast. He's a White House reporter for \"Bloomberg News.\"  A lot to get to, as always. But I want to start on these chemical attacks in Syria. The president's not calling them alleged attacks. He says this is a chemical attack and there will be a big price to pay.  Jeff, what does that lead us to?  JEFFREY GOLDBERG, \"THE ATLANTIC\": It leads us probably, if past can predict the future, a year ago he launched 49 Tomahawk missiles at various Syrian sites, did not have the desired effect. So it could lead us to another attack by the American military. It will not lead us to a conclusion or a satisfactory conclusion of the Syrian civil war. It's very, very late in the process. Assad and his Iranian and Russian allies have basically won this civil war. It's all over but the dying, it seems, in this one town.  So I don't think that the U.S. can do anything to affect the overall outcome at this late stage. Remember, Donald Trump also said just last week, we're finished with Syria. Against the wishes of the Pentagon he said this, by the way. He wants out. So it's an interesting moment to see how far he will go back in. He won't go back in far enough to make a difference.  BRENNAN: Right. And those U.S. troops, the 2,000 that are there, aren't doing anything against the Assad regime. They're fighting ISIS.  GOLDBERG: No, they're there to fight ISIS, which he thinks he's won, by the way, and Donald Trump is probably being premature when he thinks that victory is at hand.  JULIE PACE, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, this is what makes the timing of this attack so interesting is that it comes days after Trump signaled that the U.S. was getting out. While he's not using a specific timeframe publicly, he is privately telling his national security team that he wants to be out by October. That's the exact type of thing that he and Republicans criticized Barack Obama, saying, if you put a timeline on this, if you make clear to the opposition, to our foes when we're going to draw out, they will respond to that. And so we don't know exactly what is behind this (INAUDIBLE) attack, but --  GOLDBERG: Putin, Iran and Assad have read -- have read what he said.  PACE: They know the playbook.  BRENNAN: Well, it's interesting, Toluse, because John Bolton will be the new national security advisor. This is happening on his watch now. This makes for a tough first day at work.  TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, \"BLOOMBERG\": Yes, Bolton has been a hawk on a number of issues in the Middle East, including the Iraq War. He's likely to push the president more towards taking action, striking back against the Assad regime, even though the president has seen the Middle East in the light of it being a hornet's nest that the U.S. should not get involved with because it's this quagmire that does not produce any positive results for the U.S.  To the president sort of has this duality where he wants to seem very tough. We saw him name President Putin in a tweet for the first time sort of being critical against President Putin and his role in Syria. But at the same time, the president has said that he wants to get out of Syria. He wants to bring the troops home. And that's clear that Bolton's going to have a tough time sort of making the president have a coherent foreign policy when it comes to an area that he does not want to be in but he also wants to seem tough.  BRENNAN: Is there a Syria policy yet?  OLORUNNIPA: I means, is there a Trump doctrine at all?  BRENNAN: Right.  OLORUNNIPA: I mean it's -- it's difficult to know when he surrounds himself with so many different types of voices. He likes to have competing voices around him. And then he does make very impulsive foreign policy decisions. It makes it difficult to know whether or not there is an overall strategy behind what he's doing.  BRENNAN: And, Ramesh, I mean, conservatives really cheered the president when he took that action last year saying, look, he's not President Obama, who sets red lines and doesn't act on them, he's set out consequences for crossing his red line. Well, it appears another line has been crossed here. So is it --  RAMESH PONNURU, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": Right.  BRENNAN: He trapped himself?  PONNURU: Well, there was a split among conservatives, I'd say. I do think that there is a cost that you pay when president says there's a big price if he doesn't then exact on the big price.  BRENNAN: Right.  PONNURU: I think it reduces his credibility and it reduces American credibility.  But I think there's a real challenge, there's a real question about what the administration does now and I think people are going to be surprised about John Bolton, because John Bolton has never been an enthusiast for interventions for just humanitarian reasons, he's gone sort of back and forth on the Syria question depending on circumstances. In 2013, he was publicly against President Obama taking military action in Syria, and he said it's a strategic side show. So I'm not sure that he's going to live up to the caricature of being kind of a hawk's hawk on all issues.  BRENNAN: That's interesting. He's going to be in place before we get a secretary of state confirmed. Mike Pompeo's got those hearings coming up on Thursday. Does that in any way solidify Bolton? I mean does a few days on the job give him more influence in any way?  PONNURU: Well, I think what gives him more influence on the job is he apparently has a very good relationship with President Trump. Of course, other people have started out with good relationship and seen that deteriorate over time. But I think that this administration in particular, the relationship with the president personally matters a great deal even more than it does in any other administration.  BRENNAN: Jeffrey, you had a really interesting interview with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, in this past week. Now we're going to see his nemesis, of sort, the Amir of Qatar, at the White House meeting with President Trump. Are we going to see any kind of diplomatic breakthrough on that standoff between the countries?  GOLDBERG: No.  BRENNAN: I thought that was an easy question.  GOLDBERG: Yes, yes, yes. I -- well, I mean, who knows, but it doesn't seem very likely. The hatred between the Qatari royal family and the Saudi royal family is almost as deep as the hatred between the Saudi royal family and the leaders of Iraq. They -- the Saudis have defined for themselves, and for the moderate -- so-called moderate Arab wing, who the enemies are. Iran, Assad, and, to a lesser extent, but still important extent, the outlying Qataris. So it's -- it's very, very difficult to see Donald Trump negotiating peace between Gulf States.  BRENNAN: But it's significant. I mean he stood in the Rose Garden last year and said that Qatar was funding terrorism at the very highest levels.  GOLDBERG: Right.  BRENNAN: And now he's got the head of state coming to see him.  GOLDBERG: Welcome to the Middle East. I mean, you know, Qatar also is home to an important U.S. military installation.  BRENNAN: Exactly.  GOLDBERG: And the Pentagon, obviously, wants us to calibrate that relationships, like it wants us to calibrate all relationships. And Donald Trump is not an expertise -- does not have expertise in calibrating relationships in the Middle East, or possibly in many other places. So we'll see how this meeting goes. But nothing -- nothing grand is going to come out of it, I don't think.  BRENNAN: Toluse, the president will be traveling at the end of this week to South America. Will we see a preliminary trade deal on the NAFTA front, not China, on NAFTA?  OLORUNNIPA: Yes, it's not likely that it's going to happen before this meeting or during this meeting. He's going to the Summit of Americas in Lima, Peru. They're still trying to work out the kinks of a trade deal, but the president keeps throwing grenades into the entire trade relationship by announcing new tariffs, global tariffs, trying to take on China, but at the same time really making a number of our other allies unhappy when we talk about steel tariffs and aluminum tariffs that hit not only China but also a number of our different allies in different parts of the world, including South America.  And by sending troops to the southern border, he's sort of inflaming the relationship with our trade partner in Mexico and making it more difficult to have those continued talks and reach a deal during this summit.  So it's likely that we're not going to see a deal before the summit. Maybe there's some work happening behind the scenes away from the president's Twitter account and away from these very sort of incendiary moves that he's making on the border that can work itself out over the weeks to come, but not necessarily something that we're expecting to see in the next few days.  BRENNAN: Ramesh, can conservatives convince the president to save NAFTA?  PONNURU: You know, this administration is full of people who support it, but it also has lot of people who are against it. It does not speak with one voice on this issue.  Trump has given us every indication for his entire adult life that he is a protectionist by conviction. And people have been trying to talk him out of each of the steps he's already taken. So I would not be confident about NAFTA's survival.  And I think one of the reasons you're seeing the markets react the way they're reacting, it's not each individual tariff that the presidents has announce is going to be so destructive, but people don't like where this is going and they're uncertain about where it's going.  BRENNAN: The markets, a forward-looking indicator, and they're betting that this is going downhill.  PONNURU: That's right.  BRENNAN: We've got to take a commercial break.  We'll be back be more from our panel in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: And we're back with our panel.  Julie, a lot of confirmation hearings to get through for this administration. Secretary of state, first one up this week. Does Mike Pompeo makes it through?  PACE: It looks like Pompeo is going to get through. I think Democrats are going to try to make it difficult. Ultimately I think that he will be confirmed. He was already confirm for CIA chief, which tends to make it a little bit easier to get through a second time around.  The one that I would really pay attention to, though, is Gina Haspel for CIA, his replacement at the agency. This is a confirmation hearing that Republicans are uncomfortable with, simply for the fact that it's going to raise so many issues around torture, her own past history and questions about what the administration's policy is toward the types of covert actions that became a really big deal during the Obama administration, but, frankly, we haven't heard a lot about.  And then hanging over all of this is Scott Pruitt, of course. You -- one of your guests earlier today was talking about there being limited time left in the legislative calendar because the midterm elections are coming up. Lawmakers don't like to be spending a lot of time in Washington when they're running for re-election. And so you're going to hear Republicans privately telling the administration, hey, maybe you don't want to throw another at -- open -- open seat on your cabinet into the middle of this midterm when we already have two pretty difficult confirmations ahead of us.  BRENNAN: Right, and the VA secretary also.  PACE: And the VA secretary is also in the mix.  It's a pretty busy agenda. Again, not something that Republicans wanted to be dealing with in the middle of the midterm cycle.  BRENNAN: Ramesh, the president seems to have given absolution to Scott Pruitt in this tweet last night saying, you know, he's doing a great job, he's not concerned about the ethics -- accusations, at least, of ethics violations. Is it really about that or is it just simply getting somebody else to fill that job would be too tough?  PONNURU: Well, there's that and there's also that Pruitt has very strong support from conservatives who approve of his policy record at the EPA. You combine that with Trump's relative lack of condition for the kind of media ethics firestorm that in another administration would have gotten a cabinet secretary dismissed. And I think that Pruitt looks like he's weathering the storm. But if there are more scandals that break, that could change, of course.  BRENNAN: Does that mean that any prospects for a job are over for him. Of course, the president came out this week and said, no, I'm not going to replace Jeff Sessions with Scott Pruitt.  PONNURU: Well, I do think that this means that even if that were ever being contemplated, it isn't anymore. I think it is very hard, under this circumstance, to see Pruitt getting confirmed for attorney general.  BRENNAN: Toluse, what are you hearing on that front? I mean all -- speaking of jobs that don't require confirmation hearings, the chief of staff gig, it seems to be a regular headline that John Kelly is growing frustrated or the president's growing frustrated with him. It would be news if we got one that said he's happy right now.  GOLDBERG: Scott Pruitt might be available for chief of staff at any moment.  BRENNAN: But, I mean, what is the likelihood here that we see that kind of shake up?  OLORUNNIPA: Well, we have seen John Kelly's stock drop in -- within the west Wing, within the White House. And my colleague reported a few weeks ago that he's not -- he's no longer part -- a part of very important meetings, very important personnel decisions, phone calls with foreign leaders. President Trump has sort of grated at the fact that John Kelly has tried to enforce so much discipline within the West Wing, not only discipline on the staff, but also discipline on the president, who likes sort of having this free-wheeling experience within the Oval Office, phone calls with various friends and allies, people coming in and out.  John Kelly has tried to crack down on some of that, and the president has not necessarily taken to a lot of the new reforms. And the fact that John Kelly is seeing his stock drop and seeing a number of the members of his staff and a number of the officials within the West Wing more willing to talk to reporters and say John Kelly is no longer the star general that he was when he first came into the administration, makes it seem like the president may take a move, and maybe make a change. But we did see a tweet from the president saying that this was not true and not necessarily the direction that he was going.  PACE: But Toluse makes a really important point here that I think is important for people watching to understand. It's one thing for the president and his chief of staff to have a tense relationship. Trump has a tense relationship with a lot of people in his senior team. Kelly has lost the support of his staff. So he's essentially a man on an island.  BRENNAN: Why?  PACE: A large part of it is the way he handled the Rob Porter controversy. People on the staff felt like he was not being truthful in his account of his own role there. They feel like he has -- has undermined what they have been sent out to say, either on his behalf or on the president's behalf. So imagine that, you have a chief of staff in the White House who the president is not happy with, and the staff isn't happy working for. That is really untenable.  GOLDBERG: You know, and we're talking also about absolution for tweeting. And their -- the president doesn't have a great record of sticking with those grants of absolution. Reince Priebus is -- as a good example, I think.  So I mean the amazing thing about this administration is that this conversation could be overcome by events during this conversation because -- because he can do anything. The fact that he's sticking with Scott Pruitt is remarkable. The fact that he's tweeting positively about his chief of staff is remarkable. But those things can change this afternoon. And that's the nature of this entire administration.  PONNURU: Successful chiefs of staff have tended either to have a strong relationship with the president personally or to have experience in politics and good relationships with Capitol Hill. When John Kelly became chief of staff, people greeted him as an adult who was going to impose order on the process, but he didn't have either of those two qualities, and he still doesn't. In some ways some of those things are getting worse, like his relationship with the president. So while he may have imposed some discipline on this process, I'm not sure you can say that he's been a successful chief of staff.  BRENNAN: Well, what does that do to the rest of the cabinet and the administration? It's been pointed out to me that because he was a cabinet member, and rose to this position, that that has, in some ways, instilled confidence in his fellow administration members. Would a dismissal hurt anyone else?  PONNURU: You know, but the bar is always so different in this administration. \"The Washington Post\" story that president -- about Kelly that President Trump condemned earlier today was saying that there was less knife fighting and dysfunction now that Kelly is chief of staff.  OK, fine, less knife fighting and dysfunction than there was in July of last year, but that's still a lot of knife fighting and dysfunction. And every little thing increases people's worry, increases people sense. Maybe we should look for the exit, too.  BRENNAN: All right. Thank you, all of you.  We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Trey Gowdy, who grew up in an affluent white family, and Sen. Tim Scott, who is black and grew up in a poor, single-parent home, view their friendship as an unlikely one. But it's exactly the kind of friendship they believe is needed to bring about more unity in a politically and racially divided time. Both of the South Carolina Republicans joined us to talk about their new book, \"Unified: How Our Unlikely Friendship Gives Us Hope for a Divided Country,\" as well as the latest in the Russia investigation. The following is a transcript of the interview with Scott and Gowdy airing Sunday, April 1, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" I'm Margaret Brennan. We begin today with two congressional Republicans from South Carolina, Senator Tim Scott and Representative Trey Gowdy. Their new book \"Unified\" tells the story of their close friendship and their hope to heal a divided country. Welcome to both of you gentlemen. TREY GOWDY: Thank you. TIM SCOTT: Thank you. BRENNAN: I want to talk to you both about why you wrote this book, why you did it together, but I want to also ask about some of the news of the moment. The special counsel did reveal this week that Trump campaign official Rick Gates, who is a cooperating witness in that investigation, knowingly had communications on more than one occasion during the campaign with a person the FBI believes had active ties to Russian intelligence. Congressman, as a former prosecutor, what does this say to you? GOWDY:\u00a0 It says that I'm glad we have Bob Mueller. I'm glad we have an independent ball and strike caller. Congress has proven itself incapable of conducting serious investigations. And our best hope for finding - BRENNAN: You include our own committee, House Intelligence, on that? GOWDY: Absolutely. Not just House Intelligence. Congressional investigations leak like the \"Gossip Girls.\" They - I mean, they're terrible and I would be telling you that if I were staying in Congress. They are just not serious. Serious investigations don't leak. Serious investigations don't make up their mind first and then go in search of the evidence to validate your previously held conviction. BRENNAN: Did your committee do that with clearing any collusion in the case of Russia? GOWDY: I think Adam Schiff in March of 2017 said he had evidence more than circumstantial but not direct. And oh, by the way there is no body of evidence that's more than circumstantial but not direct, but he said he had it of collusion and we've been waiting for -- for over a month and -- for over a year now for him to actually produce that \u2013 that evidence. That is not serious. And -- and I'm hoping that either the Senate investigation or Mueller will - will be more objective. BRENNAN: Senator, the person tied to Russian intelligence that we're talking about did work with Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. You've been on record in the past saying that President Trump should not pardon Michael Flynn. Do you view Paul Manafort differently? SCOTT: I do not. I think it's important that the White House be clear on this position as it relates to not treating either person differently. The fact of the matter is keeping the pardon off the table is a necessary part of the process. I would be disappointed if President Trump were to pardon either one of these individuals. The good news is that the Mueller investigation continues. The better news is that the public will have as much information as necessary to draw clear conclusions. And today, it only reinforces why it's important for us to make sure that the investigation continues until it gets to the end. I hope that we get there sooner than later. But the reality of it is that the more information we find out, the better, and the more confident the American people will be in who we are as a nation. BRENNAN: Does that mean you would support legislation to protect Bob Mueller from being fired? SCOTT: I don't know that we need legislation to move forward. I don't know that there's a single senator that would come out in favor of stopping the investigation from going forward. BRENNAN: Senator, you are on the Armed Services Committee. I want to ask you a bit about what we've heard from the president. He's been floating this idea of asking to use Pentagon funding to pay for this border wall. SCOTT: Yes. BRENNAN:\u00a0 Is that lawful? SCOTT: Well, certainly, I think it would take an act of Congress to make sure that we prioritize and appropriate the dollars for that objective. The reality of it is, as commander-in-chief he can certainly send signals through Secretary Mattis to have a conversation with Congress about where those dollars should be spent. Good news is we're spending \u2013 we're providing more money to the military than we have in a very long time -- more than a decade. The unfortunate reality is that the priorities of the DOD have already been set. However, our southern border is very porous. The truth is that more folks came through our southern border that did not come from Mexico. So it is certainly a national security issue. I think Homeland, so far, is a place that we should find the resources for building the wall, not necessarily the DOD. But I'll see what comes to -- before my committee to make sure that we have enough information to make a decision. BRENNAN: You're saying Congress would need to weigh in to reprogram those funds that's not- SCOTT: Absolutely. BRENNAN: Something through executive authority you should direct. SCOTT: You should not expect that from the president. BRENNAN: I want to ask you both about this book you wrote together. SCOTT: Yes. BRENNAN: Why did you write this? GOWDY: I think he has a compelling life narrative. I find it inspirational from - from the moment we became friends. I think his - the story of how he got where he is, is a story of hope that our whole country would benefit from. I think contrast is good. I think conflict is debilitating. I think it -- we're in a dangerous time in our in our history in terms of political discourse. I think most Americans want most of the same things out of life. We just have a tendency to focus on the things that we don't agree on as opposed to those that we do. But I think there's a hunger and a yearning for unity. And if you can find it with a handsome bald headed guy from Charleston and a middle aged son of a doctor from the upstate of South Carolina then I think everyone can benefit from unlikely friendships. BRENNAN: Why is it an unlikely friendship? Senator? SCOTT: Well, we were raised very differently. We have different perspectives. While we're both Republicans, the reality of it is we come down very differently on a lot of the issues. I think about an affluent fellow from a doctor's house. A poor kid, single parent household. I think about the challenges of race in our state. We have a very provocative history on race in South Carolina. The truth is that after the 2015 Mother Emanuel Church shooting, I found myself turning to a white guy in the aftermath. It became clear to me that there is a chance to bridge real gaps in this country. And if that was an example of one real bridging of a gap - after a racially motivated shooting in Charleston, South Carolina led me to turn to a white guy that I did not know before I came to Congress. Are there lessons within this friendship that can help our nation that seems to be so polarized, in such conflict, mired in challenges, and sometimes heading towards tribalism? If there's a way to bridge that gap, can we and should we tell that story? I think we can, and I think we should, and we did. BRENNAN: What did you think when you got that phone call that night of the shooting in Charleston? GOWDY: Just what Tim said. We have a provocative history in our state when it comes to race. My first thought was \u2013 was \u2013 was a spiritual thought: \"God how can you let nine people be murdered when all they wanted to do was go learn about you?\" And then what it would mean to a black man to know that they were murdered simply because of the color of their skin. It just kind of a \"Let's don't - oh lord let's don't go here again in South Carolina.\" And the beautiful part was his intention was to start a race war in our state. And it had \u2013 BRENNAN: The shooter's intention? GOWDY: Exactly the opposite effect. BRENNAN: You've talked a lot about the incident in Charleston and that really sort of inspiring you to sit down and issue this call for action. What are you asking the public for in this book? SCOTT: I think if you look at the polarization that exists in this country, we have to find a path back to being one nation. I found that path through a horrific church shooting that provided me a chance to reflect on progress and pain. My family -- I think of my grandfather who as a -- passed away in 2016. He was unable to drink from the same water fountain for the vast majority of his life, unable to go to a restaurant, unable to walk on the same sidewalk, could not finish school beyond third grade. And for me to live out a part of his American dream, to be able to converse and to challenge other folks. And then in the aftermath of a church shooting -- think about all that history in my family -- to turn to Trey was just such a symbol of progress that I believe that all things are possible in this great nation. I think it's perhaps one of the greatest national security issues we have in this country -- that if we allow the polarization to continue in this country, those outside of this country that want to bring harm will - will eat, will feast on the division in this country and create more polarization. The Russians did that during the 2016 election. They focused on the opportunity to sow seeds of discord that only leads to an erosion of our foundation and makes us quite more vulnerable. BRENNAN: Do you think that President Trump and his administration have deepened this divide? Have you seen any signs of hope that they're helping to bridge it? SCOTT: I will say that when I went to the president after the Charlottesville incident, he asked me what could he do? We were not on the same page as it relates to the history of race in this nation. But we found common - a common position on legislative remedies that could help people in distressed communities. The opportunity zones that we're talking about throughout this country, the president said he would commit to supporting that legislation. He did. It's now law and now 50 million Americans may see reasons to breathe hopefully about the future because of that legislation that will bring more resources into distressed communities. BRENNAN: After Charlottesville you said the president is not a racist but he is racially insensitive. SCOTT: Yes. BRENNAN: Is that still what you believe? SCOTT: Absolutely. Yeah, the president is not a racist, but is he racially insensitive? I think the answer is yes. BRENNAN: You haven't seen an improvement in language or in actions by the Justice Department. SCOTT: Well I can't - I can't say whether or not the entire administration reflects his position. I will say that he has been very positive on legislative remedies. I think if you follow the facts what you'll find is that unemployment rates within the African-American community at six point nine percent haven't been this low in almost two decades. The Hispanic community hasn't been this low in almost two decades. The fact is that the policy position of the administration is moving this country in the right direction economically. We still have to work on the tone and the rhetoric. BRENNAN: Once again, we are seeing protests about the shooting of an unarmed black man, and questions being raised about excessive force, in the case of Stephon Clark. And this question at the White House was responded to with the answer, \"This is a local matter.\" Do you think that these conversations need to be had at the federal level? Do you wish that they were, or is that not appropriate? GOWDY: No, it's a national conversation. I actually took the \"local matter\" to be, maybe because I'm a prosecutor, that it's a state crime. It's a local law enforcement matter, from a criminal justice standpoint. But it's a national conversation. Tim knows my bias, I'll put that word in quotes, is towards law enforcement, as you would expect a prosecutor's to be. I am not oblivious to the fact that there are bad police officers, just like there are bad everything else. He has helped me remarkably. Not -- not just him, but also other people of color in my life have helped me understand -- every interaction I've had with the police, it's been because I was speeding. I should have had an interaction with them. I've never been stopped by Capitol Police, and I don't wear a member pin. He's been stopped wearing a member pin. So I am naive to believe that my life experience covers everyone. I have no idea what he sees when he sees blue lights. And \u2013 and \u2013 and I think he's benefited. Well I know he has. He calls the widows of fallen police officers before I call them in South Carolina. So he gets the dangerous side of it, but he is also a black man who's had a very different relationship with law enforcement than I have. So you ask, \"Why write the book?\" So we can talk to one another, find the things we have in common, instead of racing to the conflict, which is commercially successful, and you get a lot of clicks. It's just destroying our country. BRENNAN: We've got to take a quick pause in the conversation. We'll be right back in a moment. BRENNAN: We're back now for more with Senator Tim Scott and Congressman Trey Gowdy to talk about their new book, \"Unified.\" Congressman Gowdy, I've got to be honest. A lot of people in Washington when they hear that you are issuing a call for unity will say, \"He's been associated with two of the most, you know, divisive, politically heated probes in Washington - the probe into what happened in Benghazi, and the most recent House intelligence probe into Russian election meddling.\" How do you reconcile those things? GOWDY: I hear about the divisiveness. I just don't hear about it from my colleagues. I hear about it a lot from people in your line of work, how divisive I am. And yet, I don't have a fractured relationship with a single solitary Democrat that serves in the House. So, conflict sells. It is much more commercially appealable to refer to something as hyper partisan, or deeply divisive. The reality is, with respect to Benghazi, I did everything I could to handle that like a normal investigation. I was not hyper focused on Secretary Clinton. Lots of other people were, including people in your -- with respect -- in your line of work. It's not interesting enough to simply find out how our folks were rescued from the annex. If it didn't involve her, folks weren't interested in it. So, out of a hundred witnesses, one was named Clinton. And out of all the hearings we had, zero were about her e-mail. But yet, that's the narrative that's imprinted. And it's one reason I can't wait to be out of politics frankly -- BRENNAN: (laughs) GOWDY: -- where -- where the jury is a little more open minded. They haven't made up their minds yet. Facts matter. And there's a referee that can say, \"You know what, there is no evidentiary support for that whatsoever.\" In politics, you can say it and get away with it. BRENNAN: Well, you know, you do talk in the book though about the Benghazi investigation being personally difficult. GOWDY: It was terrible. BRENNAN: You, actually Senator, described it as probably the loneliest extended session of his life. SCOTT: Let me just weigh in here very quickly. Whether it's Russia, or the Benghazi investigation, the one thing that Trey tried to do in both situations was go after the truth. Not after -- not after Hillary Clinton. And Republicans were unhappy with that. He went after the truth. Democrats were unhappy because Hillary Clinton was attached to the conversation, and she had no choice but to be attached to it. It happened on her watch. But on the Russia situation, the fact of the matter is, if you listen to Trey Gowdy talk about how poorly the president's lawyer represented his position, there's no question that if you're looking for a way to be partisan on the issue, you don't make those comments. BRENNAN: You're referring there to John Dowd? SCOTT: If you're looking for the truth. Yes. If you're looking for the truth, then you go where it leads. And there's no doubt that if you look at the actual evidence on both of those situations, it is clear that Trey Gowdy was looking for the truth. And one of the reasons why I talk about that in the book, the Benghazi story, is because to watch the weight of the investigation on his face, and on his shoulders, and frankly on that hair that is now whiter than snow -- BRENNAN: (laughs) SCOTT: -- it is because he did not want to be a partisan. His objective was to be a prosecutor looking for the truth and then present the evidence to the American people and let that jury decide. BRENNAN: You know, in reading this book, it sounds -- it's clear the affection you have for each other. And Congressman Gowdy, you seem very supportive of the senator and him staying in Washington, though you say you're going back home. People are going to ask the question of whether you are going to make a run for office. I know you're not going to want to answer it, but congressman, should he run for president in 2020? GOWDY: Oh, I don't know about 2020. I've run in two Republican primaries, talk about lonely. That's the loneliest feeling in the world, running against an incumbent in a primary. I would love for Tim \u2013 BRENNAN: So you don't think that'll happen for President Trump? He won't be primaried? GOWDY: It may, but I don't think it's going to be Tim Scott. I would love Tim Scott to run for president, whether it's 2024 -- whenever it fits his heart. But he has a cheery, optimistic brand of conservatism that I think our country would benefit from, and quite frankly, whether he won or not, our country would be better off hearing someone with his life story. The grandson of a man who couldn't read, picked cotton, and then he grew up to pick out a seat in the United States House of Representatives. That's the story I wish my fellow citizens could hear. Whether he wins, I hope he runs. BRENNAN: Senator? SCOTT: I'm not even running for my homeowner association's presidency. So, at this point, I thank God that I've had the privilege of serving the great people of South Carolina and this great nation. I'm a kid that got a second chance. I almost flunked out of high school as a freshman. My mother worked 16 hours a day to give me a reason to believe in this nation and having a great work ethic. I'm blessed already to fulfill a part of the mission that I think the good Lord has sent me to fulfill. And as long as I continue to work hard for the people, whatever the good Lord has next for me, I'm open to it. BRENNAN: Senator, Congressman, thank you very much for sharing your story. \u00a0",

MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: Today on FACE THE NATION: President Trump turns tradition upside down again, agreeing to meet face-to-face with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un to discuss denuclearization. If it happens, he will be the first sitting U.S. president to meet with a North Korean leader.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think North Korea is going to go very well. They promised they wouldn't be shooting off missiles in the meantime as they're looking to de-nuke. So, that will be great.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRENNAN: Despite the diplomatic coup for President Trump, skeptics are concerned it will end up being a propaganda victory for Kim's rogue regime.  We will speak with CIA Director Mike Pompeo about the risks, conditions for the summit, and the state of North Korea's nuclear program.  The diplomatic gamble and some concessions on the part of the president toward U.S. allies cools a potential international trade war.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: A lot of steel mills are now opening up because of what I did. Steel is back and aluminum is back.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRENNAN: But some Republicans in Congress fear the tariffs will hurt American manufacturers and farmers and vow to fight the president. We will talk with Colorado Republican Senator Cory Gardner about that and get his reaction to the news on North Korea.  CBS News correspondent Holly Williams will report from South Korea about the silence from Kim Jong-un since the since the announcement in Washington. We will discuss the developing diplomatic situation with a special panel of experts and have plenty of analysis on the week's political news.  It is coming up now on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I am Margaret Brennan.  Since he accepted North Korean leader's Kim Jong-un invitation to meet, President Trump has been publicly optimistic and had kind words about a regime he has harshly criticized.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: South Korea came to my office, after having gone to North Korea and seeing Kim Jong-un and...  (BOOING)  TRUMP: No, it is very positive. No.  After the meeting, you may do that, but now we have to be very nice. I think they want to do something. I think they want to make peace. I think it is time.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRENNAN: But there are many questions about the risk of such direct talks and what conditions must be met before the two leaders sit down.  To get some insight, we turn now to CIA Director Mike Pompeo.  Director, welcome to the show.  It has been three days since the president accepted this invitation. Has North Korea responded?  MIKE POMPEO, CIA DIRECTOR: Well, Margaret, first of all, thanks for having me on the show.  I think it is important to step back, to figure out how we got here. For two decades, America whistled past the graveyard and allowed the North Korean regime to build up the capacity that this administration faced when it came into office.  BRENNAN: You said still a few months away from being able to hit the U.S. mainland with nuclear weapons?  POMPEO: That's right. They have made tremendous progress over these years.  President Trump took a different tack entirely, put an enormous global, ally-supported pressure campaign on the North Koreans that has had a real impact on the regime, on the North Korean economy, and has caused Kim Jong-un to reach out and say that he wants to begin to have discussions on terms that the United States has never achieved before.  That is where we find ourselves today. And we are going to work hard to make sure that we get what it is the president has set out very clearly for his entire time in office, which is the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.  BRENNAN: Are we in direct contact with North Korea?  POMPEO: I think Secretary Tillerson has said that there are channels open.  BRENNAN: But we haven't heard back whether Kim will accept what the president said is his willingness to meet as soon as May?  POMPEO: I don't want to get into the conversations that may or may not be taking place. The president has indicated he is prepared to go have an initial discussion on this incredibly important topic, and we are preparing for that time.  BRENNAN: Now, the president accepted this invitation fairly quickly on the promise, as you gestured to, of a pause in missile and nuclear tests. Why not ask for more? Why not ask for an actual freeze of their program, so they don't use diplomacy as a cover to continue development?  POMPEO: Well, that's -- we have gotten more than any previous administration, an agreement to not continue testing nuclear weapons and their missile program, the things that would put them capable of getting across the threshold. That is critical.  He has allowed to continue -- us to continue our exercises on the peninsula, something that has been fought over for decades. And at the same time, he has agreed to have a conversation about denuclearization.  In the end, Margaret, what will turn out is not about words and what someone says. This administration has in its eyes wide open. And the whole time this conversation takes place, the pressure will continue to mount on North Korea. There is no relief in sight until the president gets the objective that he has set forth consistently during his entire time in office.  BRENNAN: So, you are saying more sanctions, but, in the meantime, North Korea can continue its enrichment, its computer modeling, things that would allow it to enrich and develop its nuclear program.  POMPEO: Well, I don't want to comment on that specifically, but be sure...  BRENNAN: Well, they haven't pledged not to.  POMPEO: Be sure that is happening today. Be sure that is happening today, and so...  (CROSSTALK)  BRENNAN: But that could continue happening while we are talking?  POMPEO: Our efforts are to put pressure on them to prevent them having financial resources to continue to build out these programs.  We have been very effective at these things. None of that is going to change while we prepare to have a set of talks between the two people who can make these important decisions.  BRENNAN: Are you open to meeting with your North Korean counterpart?  POMPEO: I will leave how these discussions proceed to the president of the United States. He will set the course and tone for the direction.  But I had a chance this weekend to read the histories, the CIA's histories of our involvement in the previous failed negotiations. You can be sure that say I won't make those mistakes again. We will be at the center of providing the intelligence picture to the president and to the secretary of state, so that each of them can understand how it is we can most likely achieve the president's objective.  BRENNAN: When I spoke to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last month on \"60 Minutes,\" he described what he said was the plan for talks.  Let's listen to that.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  REX TILLERSON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We do have a plan for negotiations. We have an end state for that. It is a very stepwise process. We are not just going to leap from where we are today to denuclearization.  We understand this is something that will have to be done through various steps to eventually achieve that final objective of denuclearization. And that will come through a lot of negotiations, a lot of difficult talks.  What we have to determine now is, are we even ready to start? Are they ready to start?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRENNAN: Tillerson said this will be done through him. Is that still the plan?  POMPEO: This is a level of discussion, this president is going to drive this effort, this negotiation, but it will take a team to build out the picture, so that we put the president in the best position so that he can achieve that outcome.  BRENNAN: Because it is unclear, though, if it's the State Department or your agency that will take the lead. It was your counterpart from South Korea who was at the White House this week.  POMPEO: I don't think there is any doubt about who is going to take the lead on this.  The president of the United States is going to take the lead in developing...  BRENNAN: So, the first meeting will be that presidential summit?  POMPEO: The United States will take the lead in resolving this important conflict with North Korea.  BRENNAN: But in terms of laying the groundwork, you can't send your president into that meeting without making sure that you give him the best tools possible. Will you take those first meetings? Will the secretary take those first meetings? How do you lay the groundwork for success?  POMPEO: Margaret, I am not going to talk about how the negotiations will proceed on this Sunday show.  Rest assured, when the president enters that room with Kim Jong-un, if Kim Jong-un lives up to the four commitments that he has made, those four major concessions, the president will be fully prepared for his conversation with Kim Jong-un.  BRENNAN: In terms of the goal here, when you were in Congress, you were harshly critical of the nuclear deal with Iran that the Obama administration negotiated.  And there are obviously flaws that even they recognized there. But the Iranians did give up the vast majority of their nuclear fuel, and their production facilities aren't functioning.  Have you set a higher benchmark for these talks, since North Korea is farther along with its nuclear program?  POMPEO: Yes, Margaret, I think that's the case.  Most importantly, the conditions are very different. The previous administration was negotiating from a position of weakness. This administration will be negotiating from a position of enormous strength, with sanctions that are unrivaled against the North Korean regime.  That conversation will proceed very differently. My critique of the Obama administration's JCPOA commitment was that they left the Iranians with a breakout capacity. They had a short time frame that these would -- these restrictions would remain in place. And North Korea's human capital and enrichment capacity continues to remain in place.  Those are all things that present risks for the world. And President Obama is -- excuse me -- President Trump is determined to prevent that from happening in North Korea.  BRENNAN: So you look at that deal and say, that is a starting point or that is at least what we can reach, if not go beyond that with North Korea?  POMPEO: Yes, ma'am.  BRENNAN: Well, North Korea, as we have said, is further along in its program. You said a few months away from being able to hit the U.S. mainland in January.  How much farther have they progressed since January?  POMPEO: I don't want to get into any details on that.  Suffice it to say, I think a few months is still a fair characterization of where the regime sits today with respect to their capacity to reach the United States.  BRENNAN: I want to quickly ask you about Syria. But before I do that, can you tell us anything about those three Americans who are still in captivity in North Korea?  POMPEO: No, ma'am. I don't have anything to add to that. The State Department is handling those negotiations. And America does have as a priority getting the return of those three American citizens just as quickly as we can.  BRENNAN: In Syria, there are now reports of napalm being used, in addition to chlorine gas attacks just outside Damascus in East Ghouta.  Why doesn't the president's red line on chemical weapons apply in these cases?  POMPEO: Margaret, the president has made very clear that he won't tolerate chemical weapons usage. And he has demonstrated his willingness to respond.  In this case, the intelligence community is working diligently to verify what happened there. I have seen the pictures. You have seen the pictures as well. We have a higher standard to make sure we understand precisely what took place, precisely who did it, so that our response can meet the threat.  And we are working to develop that. We have seen these reports. And the president asks me nearly every day what it is the intelligence community knows about the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons and who else, the Russians or the Iranians, who might be responsible for them.  BRENNAN: So, for you, it's a question of is it the regime or is it the Russians using the napalm and chlorine gas? Just to clarify.  POMPEO: We are still trying to figure out precisely what happened in each of these cases.  BRENNAN: The Israelis, including their prime minister, was here this week, was warning that Iran is unchecked within Syria.  Should the U.S. mission change to be able to a counter Iran and its proxies like Hezbollah?  POMPEO: Well, I will leave policy to others.  What I can say about what is taking place inside of Syria is that the Iranians had a free pass in the previous administration. In fact, the JCPOA and the negotiations prevented a United States response. That is, they didn't want -- the previous administration, Ben Rhodes and Obama's team, didn't want to upset the apple cart.  This administration has taken a much stronger approach, a much more aggressive posture with respect to countering Iran.  BRENNAN: But that's part of the mission now.  POMPEO: And we are working closely -- and we are working closely with the Israelis to develop a full intelligence picture of what is taking place there, so that the president has options to counter that threat.  BRENNAN: So what I hear you saying is that the mission is not solely to counter ISIS? You are also looking at Iran and its proxies?  POMPEO: The president has made very clear we are working diligently to find the right approach to counter the incredible spread of Iranian hegemony throughout the Middle East.  BRENNAN: Director, I have so much more to talk to you about, but I am out of time here.  POMPEO: Thank you, Margaret.  BRENNAN: Thank you for coming on the show. It is great to hear directly from you.  POMPEO: Thank you, ma'am.  BRENNAN: We are joined now by Colorado Senator Cory Gardner, a leading Republican voice in Congress on North Korea policy. And he joins us from his family's farm equipment business in Yuma, Colorado, which is -- you got tractor parts behind you there, sir.  SEN. CORY GARDNER (R), COLORADO: We have got a lot of stuff that I used to stock in here a long, long time ago.  (LAUGHTER)  BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you, on the news of the moment, you and five other Republican senators sent a letter to the administration asking them to outline their North Korea strategy. You just heard the CIA director outline his thoughts here. Did you hear the strategy you were asking for?  GARDNER: Well, I think what I heard him say is right, that we have found ourselves in this position because of the maximum pressure doctrine, turning away from the failed doctrine of strategic patience, and are now really crippling what was left of the North Korean economy.  But what we have to hear more of is how we are going to get to those concrete, verifiable steps toward denuclearization before this meeting occurs. I have talked a lot about the diplomatic runway, the length we have left on the diplomatic runway, ways we can work with North Korea, work with China, who has enabled North Korea in many cases, and to make sure that we are putting maximum pressure on them.  But we have to have those steps, those real concrete steps, before this meeting occurs, because after this meeting, there is going to be very little left of that diplomatic runway.  BRENNAN: Well, so those four steps that the director says this administration has guaranteed that have gone farther than past administrations in his claim, those are not enough for you?  GARDNER: Well, if you go back to 1994 to the agreed framework, you go back to 2005, North Korea has made a lot of promises, and they have reneged on every single one of those promises.  And so what we have to do is to assure that we are in a different position than we were back in '94, back in 2005, back in 2007, is to see concrete steps. Look...  BRENNAN: So you want an actual freeze of the nuclear program before talks start?  GARDNER: Well, look, I would like to see some concrete steps, more than just a cessation of testing, because you can still do computer modeling.  Look, the United States is making advances every day on our nuclear program, and we are not testing nuclear missiles and nuclear weapons each day. But we are still making advancements. And so what we need to see is North Korea actually start living up to some of the agreements, the agreements that they have already made that they said they would to the United States decades ago.  BRENNAN: You are also one of about 100 Republicans who have urged the president to reconsider these tariffs on steel and aluminum he signed off on this week.  He is not changing his mind, so what kind of legislative work-around are you proposing?  GARDNER: Well, we have legislative tools at our disposal.  The question is, of course, how do we get that to the president for his signature? Our founders set up a system where the president has to agree with legislation that comes out of Congress. And there are ways that we can narrow the framework that the president is using to increase or levy those tariffs. There are things that we can do.  But I think most importantly is this, a recognition that we agree on fair trade deals, that agree that we want the United States treated in a way that we are treating other nations. And if we can do better, then we should better.  But I am concerned that a tariff can result in a tax on the very same people that we are trying to help in this economy, that they could actually be hurt, instead of being helped by this action. So let's work and spend the next few weeks trying to figure out exactly how narrowly tailored these tariffs can be, go after the bad actors.  If that is China, then let's make sure that we hold them accountable and responsible. But I spoke with the CEO of a EVRAZ steel mill in Colorado, Conrad Winkler. We talked a little bit about just the impact that the NAFTA would have on the them if we were to withdraw, doubled with the steel tariff.  He is very grateful that Canada has been removed from the steel tariffs. Who else is going to be removed through this process, we will wait and see. But I think there's a lot of conversations that we need to have with this White House to make sure that the economic benefit outweighs economic harm of such tariff actions.  BRENNAN: Would you ask for a carve-out for countries that have a security relationship with the United States, like South Korea and Japan?  GARDNER: Well, I think it is incredibly important that we have our allies standing with us, not just on the economy, but in security matters.  And if you look at the North Korea situation, what South Korea is dealing with, what Japan is dealing with -- and that's why a lot of the times when I talk about North Korea, I talk about the trilateral relationship between Japan, South Korea and the United States. This is not just the United States alone. It's not just South Korea alone.  This is an important relationship that we have to get right. So if Japan cheating us, then let's get that fixed. But right now, what we ought to be focusing on is how we can get this right for the economy, open up new opportunities to trade, not fewer, and let's hold the responsible actors like China responsible for their actions...  BRENNAN: Right.  GARDNER: ... and not bring our friends into a way that can cause harm.  BRENNAN: Last night, at a Pennsylvania rally, President Trump said Ronald Reagan was not great on trade.  Is the Republican agenda still pro-free trade?  GARDNER: You know, absolutely.  There's some -- I think everyone in Congress agrees that opening up new markets is better for the United States.  BRENNAN: Do you disagree with the president?  GARDNER: The president is not wrong when he says -- look, the president is not wrong when he says that we need fair deals.  If somebody is taking advantage of us, if our markets are open, and nobody is -- and they are not paying tariffs to get into this country, but yet we turn around and have to pay tariffs to get into their country, then something is wrong with that. I think the American people understand that.  But where we are going to get this wrong is if we start into a trade war that results in our allies penalizing us, increasing cost of consumer goods, making it more difficult for the American people to afford goods that they commonly buy at the grocery store.  I am particularly concerned about the impact this could have on agriculture, because agriculture is really going to be in the front lines of any kind of trade retaliation that we see.  BRENNAN: Right.  GARDNER: And I'm in a big ag state right here, where most of our top 10 exports are agriculture. So we have to get this right.  We have narrowly tailor this to the bad actors. I do believe that, in general, tariffs are a tax on the American people. And the people who are going to be harmed by this are the very people who we're trying to help so much, the people who have struggled far too long for the past decades that haven't seen a wage increase in years.  BRENNAN: I want to quickly ask you about guns.  Texas Senator John Cornyn has a bill proposing strengthening the background check system. Is it correct that you have put a hold on this?  GARDNER: I think there are some of us who are talking about due process issues in the bill and legislation.  I have talked to Senator Cornyn. And I hope that Senator Cornyn will realize that we need to work this due process matter out. This is not an issue of whether you like this or not. It is a question of constitutional rights and protecting the people of this country, protecting them from harm.  BRENNAN: So you are blocking the bill for now?  GARDNER: And -- and making sure we are protecting people from harm and making sure that we get this right.  And if there is a constitutional issue at stake, then that should be worked out.  BRENNAN: But to clarify from your answer there, are you blocking this bill from the floor?  GARDNER: This bill can come to the floor, and we will continue to work through an amendment process. And I hope that we can fix those amendments.  BRENNAN: After you fix this bill, you will allow it to go to the floor, but not before this?  GARDNER: Well, I think, if we can have an amendment process that works to fix due process concerns, real constitutional issues, then I hope that is something that we can do.  I hope that people who support this bill are interested, like all of us, in making sure we are protecting the American people from harm.  BRENNAN: All right.  Senator Gardner, thank you very much for joining FACE THE NATION.  GARDNER: Thanks for having me. Thank you.  BRENNAN: We will be back in one minute with CBS News correspondent Holly Williams reporting from South Korea.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: Since Thursday's announcement about a meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, there's been plenty of reaction here and from our allies.  We turn now to CBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams in Seoul, South Korea, some 35 miles from the North Korean border.  Holly, what are you hearing over there?  HOLLY WILLIAMS, CBS NEWS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Margaret.  What is bizarre is that the whole world is talking about this meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, but we have had no direct confirmation of it from North Korea. It has been completely silent, at least in public.  This has all come through South Korea.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  WILLIAMS (voice-over): It began with a rare meeting between senior South Korean officials and Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang this past week. He gave them a message for President Trump, inviting him to meet.  The South Koreans delivered it to the president personally.  CHUNG EUI-YONG, SOUTH KOREA NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Kim said that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests.  WILLIAMS: It is an extraordinary turn of events, after a spate of North Korean missile tests last year, another nuclear test in September, and months of insults.  Du Yong Kim (ph) is an expert on North Korea and its nuclear program, and says the North is eager to talk because economic sanctions are hurting the regime.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is not going to be easy, because the North Koreans are very good negotiators, and they know how to play the game.  WILLIAMS (on camera): What is the game that they play?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Get everything they want, and give nothing in return.  WILLIAMS (voice-over): North Korea has also reneged on previous deals. Other sitting U.S. presidents have decided against meeting with North Korean leaders and rewarding them with some legitimacy without getting concessions from them first.  (on camera): Is it possible that they are better negotiators than President Trump, who prides himself on being able to make a deal?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The North Koreans have had 25 years of experience dealing with Americans. But, in the States, the administrations change. That is what the North sees as America's strategic weakness, changes in personnel, changes in characters.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  WILLIAMS: The key player in this region is China, perhaps the only country with the leverage to force North Korea to denuclearize.  It has been tougher on enforcing sanctions recently, but, for years, China has been North Korea's biggest trading partner and a lifeline to the regime -- Margaret.  BRENNAN: Holly, thanks.  And we will be back with our national security panel to talk more about this potentially historic development.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: We're joined now by a panel of national security experts,  Michael Morell is a former deputy CIA director and CBS News senior security contributor. Jung Pak is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute. She has worked at the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. And David Sanger is national security correspondent for \"The New York Times\" and a CNN contributor.  Mike, what did you make of Director Pompeo's justification of these talks?  MICHAEL MORELL, CBS NEWS SENIOR SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR: So, I thought it was very interesting that both the director and Senator Gardner made it absolutely clear that the United States feels that we are coming to this from a position of strength, because the sanctions have been tough, right, they have hurt.  But what is interesting is that I think that Kim Jong-un also feels that he is coming to this from a position of strength. He has nuclear weapons. He has demonstrated an ICBM capability. He hasn't demonstrated that can put them together yet, but he also feels he is coming at this from a position of strength, sitting down with an -- as an equal  So I think that says something about expectations on both sides and whether they can be met or not.  BRENNAN: You think this is a reward before anything has been given up?  MORELL: So, I think that North Korea in general and Kim Jong-un in particular put a very high value on being seen as meeting with the president of the United States.  It gives him legitimacy both at home and abroad. It's very important to him. He has gotten -- he will get that if this happens. He has only given a short-term freeze in missile and nuclear tests, right? I think we could have gotten more for what he really wanted here.  BRENNAN: OK.  Well, we need to take a very short break. We have a lot more to talk about with all of you. So, stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: We will be back with a lot more FACE THE NATION and our national security panel, plus our political analysis.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan.  And we are back with our panel of national security experts.  Michael Morell is CBS News senior national security contributor. Jung Pak is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute. And David Sanger, of course, is a national security correspondent for The New York Times.  Jung, I want to start with you.  Do you think these talks will actually happen? North Korea has been silent since President Trump accepted the invitation?  JUNG PAK, BROOKINGS INSTITUTE: Right.  I think it is an excellent point, is that we haven't heard anything from North Korea that these talks have actually been offered or that any concessions, or so-called concessions, have been offered.  All of this is coming secondhand from the South Koreans, who have an interest in making sure that the North Korea and U.S. talks happen. So, that said, North Korea is keeping mum. And I am not surprised about that, given -- that gives them maximum flexibility on their next moves.  And I am sure that Kim is monitoring all the discussions and debate going on in Washington about whether or -- whether President Trump should have been -- have accepted this offer.  BRENNAN: You think this was a bluff, possibly?  PAK: I don't know that if it was a bluff, but I can see Kim Jong-un dangling the possibility of -- or of its willingness to meet with the president, but then being surprised.  So I wouldn't be surprised if we see some policy dysfunction from North Korea or a delayed reaction or response from North Korea as a result.  BRENNAN: And, David, you have covered this before. It is not the first time that an American president has been issued an invitation to Pyongyang or to meet with North Korean leaders. It is the first time that we know of that they said yes, though.  DAVID SANGER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": That's right.  Well, that's why I think it was so interesting when Director Pompeo said that President Trump had already accomplished more than any past president. And I think, on this, the director, with all due respect, was probably just wrong.  President Clinton reached an agreement in 1994 that lasted for about six years, but suspended all of their production of nuclear material. The president was offered -- President Clinton was offered a chance to go to North Korea to talk about missiles. And in the end, he sent Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. That deal fell apart.  President Bush had two different sets of agreements with the North Koreans. Both of those worked for a while, but then also fell apart. So, it is a little early for a victory lap here.  But I do think that the director set a very interesting barrier for President Trump today, when he said that this really has to be, in response to your question, stronger than the Iran deal.  And, in the Iran deal, let's remember what happened. The Iranians...  BRENNAN: He was a big critic of that deal.  SANGER: He was a very big critic of that deal. The president has been a big critic of that deal.  The Iranians gave up 97 percent of their nuclear material. They stopped running and dismantled some of their nuclear facilities. There are a lot of reasons to be critical of the fact that the agreement doesn't last forever. It begins -- it expires starting in 10 years, and then pieces of it expire in 15 years.  But the fact of the matter is, if you could get that out of North Korea, the president would be taking a very big victory lap.  BRENNAN: It is a pretty high benchmark to set, Mike.  MORELL: Yes.  I think, in terms of, Margaret, thinking about what the best outcomes would be here and the worst outcomes, I think the best outcome would be if they meet and they set -- agreed on a set of principles by which negotiations would continue at a lower level.  BRENNAN: That was Secretary of State Tillerson's proposal.  MORELL: Exactly. I think that is the best outcome.  The worst outcome -- there's two of them, right? One of the worst outcomes is a breakdown, is that the meeting doesn't go well, and they are sniping at each other afterwards, because where do you two from then, right? That's the danger here.  The other worst outcome is if we take the pressure off in some way and if we give some sort of sanctions relief for something not very significant, right? Those are the two worst outcomes.  BRENNAN: Jung, one of the, you know, criticisms is that you do one of these presidential summits at the end, not the beginning of a negotiation.  But then I have spoken to officials who said, look, Kim Jong-un is the only person worth negotiating with in North Korea, because he is an absolute dictator  So it is a unique policy, but is it the wrong approach?  PAK: Yes, so I will leave it up to the experts on -- the policy-makers on the policy.  But I think that because President Trump has already said yes to this meeting, if it happens, this meeting is too big to fail. And I see multiple dimensions of risk, is if -- one, if Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump don't get along.  You heard Director Pompeo say that Donald Trump wants to resolve this issue. Michael Morell, I think, has correctly identified Kim Jong-un's confidence. So, if you have two confident leaders coming to the table demanding things of each other, they are not going to get along.  But the other side is that, if they do get along and somehow Donald Trump, Mr. Trump is -- thinks that he is getting a win from Kim Jong-un, and that we have this convergence of a U.S. president who is suspicious of alliances in general, that he might be willing to trade away the alliance for some sort of win for the United States, such as no each ICBMs, for example.  So there are ways of -- there are different ways of risks. But I think it is all in our interest for this meeting to succeed.  BRENNAN: The ranks of the State Department are thin right now. That's well-known. So who should be leading the negotiations here?  PAK: I think it has to be somebody, if it's not -- if this person doesn't already -- isn't already in position, it has to be a special envoy with the explicit confidence of the White House and the president himself to either run the advance team to make sure that Kim Jong-un actually said what he is reported to have said, and to...  BRENNAN: Because this is all secondhand through the South Koreans.  PAK: Right.  And to manage the process after the fact, after the summit, if it happens.  BRENNAN: David, this is all through the South Korean telling of what happened during this dinner, four-hour dinner in Pyongyang last week.  I mean, is that -- it certainly struck me as unusual to have an official make announcement of the president's schedule. How do you sort of digest what seems to be a decision without a policy process?  SANGER: Well, first of all, that wouldn't be the first time in the Trump administration that we saw that happen.  What you might have expected is that President Trump would have heard this, said, let's go back and confirm this, do some of the back-channel work that Secretary Tillerson has said he has developed with the North Koreans, to confirm the North Koreans are offering exactly what the South Koreans said they were offering, and then try to figure out the modality in which you do this.  I think if you looked at the photographs that were taken in the Oval Office when the president was meeting with the South Korean delegation, it seemed to me that when he said he would go ahead and do this, he was surprising his secretary of defense and his national security adviser.  BRENNAN: He was?  SANGER: Yes, pretty clearly.  BRENNAN: He accepted on the spot.  SANGER: And he certainly surprised his secretary of state, who was traveling in Africa at the time.  That gets you to the next big question on this, which is, has the president thought very much about what the United States is willing to give up in these negotiations? Because if we have learned anything from them -- and, Margaret, you and I covered the Iran negotiations for a long time -- there is a lot the U.S. is going to have to go give here.  If Kim Jong-un is actually willing to denuclearize, that may be worth a lot. But we also know that the North Koreans have made it very clear they never plan to denuclearize. And what they do plan to do, they say, is to be regarded as a nuclear power.  So we would have to think hard. Would we be willing to pull all of our troops out of South Korea? Would we be willing to stop all of the exercises that have gone on over the years? That could get at this erosion of the alliance that everybody is so worried about.  BRENNAN: So, the South Koreans, you would say, might need to be in the room. The Japanese do, they need to be in the room? Can this be just direct, U.S. and North Korea?  MORELL: Well, I think the negotiations, right, should include the South Koreans, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Russians, right? They all need to be part of this.  It is very, very important to keep our alliance structure together, the South Koreans and the Japanese, not only because of North Korea, but because of China as well.  Here, we have Japan, right, who got slapped twice this week, on aluminum and steel once, and then on being surprised on this meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un.  It is an extraordinarily important relationship. It has to be managed. It wasn't managed this week.  BRENNAN: And the U.S. not only is hitting Japan with those tariffs, but possibly South Korea. And there is a free trade deal discussion that is not really going very far right now either, Jung.  I mean, are there already cracks in this alliance?  PAK: I think alliance management is pretty difficult to do.  And I think, given the national priorities of both the United States and with South Korea, that there are bound to be cracks and fissures in the relationship. That said, it doesn't look good when we are dealing with the North Korea situation and the president is talking about trade.  BRENNAN: All right, we have to leave it there. But I am sure we are going to be talking much more about this over the coming months, particularly if we see that meeting in May.  (LAUGHTER)  BRENNAN: We will be right back with our political panel.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: And now for some political analysis.  Michael Gerson is a \"Washington Post\" columnist and a contributor to \"The Atlantic.\" Molly Ball is a national political correspondent for \"TIME\" magazine. And Susan Glasser is the chief international affairs columnist at Politico. We would like to welcome Shannon Pettypiece to the broadcast as well. She's a White House correspondent for Bloomberg News.  Shannon, let's start off with you.  The president softened a little bit on the trade wars this week, took Canada and Mexico off the hit list, at least for now, when it comes steel and aluminum tariffs. Is there actual wiggle room on this, or is the policy decided?  SHANNON PETTYPIECE, BLOOMBERG NEWS: I think there is wiggle room.  And Republicans on Congress are doing everything they can to wiggle as much within that room as possible, very strong language coming out from even some of Trump's most consistent defenders, Orrin Hatch saying he doesn't think these tariffs are a good idea. Senator Jeff Flake is getting ready to introduce some legislation that would nullify these.  And it's possible they would have enough votes, with Democrats, enough Democrats on board, this could be one of the rare moments where Democrats and Republicans could come together, because they see the economic consequences of this being so catastrophic for parts of the economy.  BRENNAN: To override a presidential veto?  PETTYPIECE: Possibly, yes.  We were asking people about that. I mean, there are some Democrats in the Rust Belt, the Tim Ryans of the world, who do support the steel industry and see that as a big area. I don't know specifically his position on this, but -- in those sort of Rust Belt areas -- but a lot of other Democrats who do see the economic consequences of this being very, very damaging.  BRENNAN: Molly, does trade become an election issue in the midterms?  MOLLY BALL, \"TIME\": It is possible.  I mean, you saw the president campaigning yesterday in one of the states where it is a very big election issue. And I have spent a lot of time in Central Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania, where this is a big deal.  And I think that, you know, Trump's political advisers believe this was a key part of his political appeal in 2016, and the reason that he was able to flip those so-called blue wall states of the Rust Belt, the Industrial Midwest.  There is a powerful political appeal to this tariffs issue. Republican policy-makers are pretty much uniformly set against it. Republican voters are not.  And Republican-leaning independent voters in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, the trade deal was in the Republican primary one of Trump's biggest differences with the other candidates in that field, because he sensed, I think correctly, as, you know, Ross Perot did before him and Pat Buchanan, that there is a constituency even among Republican voters for tariffs.  BRENNAN: And, Michael, the president said last week, Ronald Reagan wasn't good on trade.  MICHAEL GERSON, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Yes.  BRENNAN: Ronald Reagan is an icon, typically, for Republicans.  GERSON: Yes. He doesn't respect icons in that way.  I think that this is revealing in an entirely different way. I mean, Republicans really have come together, 107 of them, to resist the president's policy on this. But when you look at all the previous provocations where they might be critical of the president, it is tariffs? It is not misogyny? It is not, you know, nativism and racism?  It reveals something about the Republican Party that this is their red line.  PETTYPIECE: Don't mess with aluminum. Don't mess with their aluminum.  GERSON: Right. Exactly.  BALL: Gary Cohn stayed in place after Charlottesville, but he quit over this.  GERSON: Yes. So, I think it's revealing.  BRENNAN: What do you think it reveals? That it is purely about economic policy when it comes to the Republican agenda?  GERSON: Well, I quote Saint Augustine. He talked about the order of the loves. This is the order of their loves.  (LAUGHTER)  GERSON: This is what they dearly value in life.  And I think that that is a serious problem for Republicans. They need to show some passion, I think, for recovery in the future on some other issues that -- in resisting the Trump agenda.  BRENNAN: So, Susan, you have written a bit about that as well in terms of flipping the script on the Republican agenda, the change towards Russia and how this has somehow become a partisan issue.  SUSAN GLASSER, POLITICO: Well, that's right.  It used to be, just as Republicans were the bedrock party of free trade, right -- if there's one thing we knew that that was the consensus of the Republican Party on, it was free trade -- the same thing was true on the hawkishness toward Russia, which generally had prevailed and persisted through the end of the Cold War.  Now you look at those public opinion surveys, and, basically, because the party's standard-bearer, Donald Trump, has changed his view last year in 2016, the Republican electorate changed their view in an astonishingly short period of time.  So, this coming weekend, Vladimir Putin be up for his sort of token reelection. He's already the longest serving Russian leader since Joseph Stalin. Now he has the prospect of six more years.  You have -- by the way, today, as we are having this conversation, it hasn't come up, but Xi Jinping will be basically now rubber-stamped as the leader for life in China. They are eliminating term limits on their leadership today.  These two incredibly significant geopolitical things are happening in the context of an American presidency this week, we see more clearly than any other, it is a presidency, as someone in my household wrote, a presidency of one.  And, you know, you see him shedding advisers. Unclear whether he is listening to the counsel of others. And I think that goes to the politics. The Republican Party doesn't really know what it stands for anymore under President Trump.  BRENNAN: And you recently interviewed Senator Jim Risch, who would take control of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we believe, if Bob Corker does what he says he is going to do, and step down.  GLASSER: Right.  BRENNAN: And that leaves some oversight, at least for foreign policy, somewhat unchecked, in your description of your conversation with him.  GLASSER: Well, I think this underscores what we are talking about.  You have basically a Republican Party that is deeply uncomfortable, at least on Capitol Hill, with many of the president's policy positions, whether it is his favorable comments towards Vladimir Putin, whether it's his jettisoning of the party's traditional free trade stamp.  And yet the political imperatives, they are afraid to directly challenge him. It is interesting that some of them are speaking out on trade. And I think that is what I came away with thinking. The future chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee doesn't really agree with the president on many of these foreign policy issues, and yet his articulated goal for the committee would be not to criticize and stand up to him, the way that Bob Corker has.  BRENNAN: Michael, I want to ask you.  You just wrote an in-depth piece about sort of the struggle within -- as you see it, the search for the soul of the evangelical movement in many ways.  You say they have lost their interest in decency.  What do you think the evangelicals who support President Trump make of the Stormy Daniels scandal?  GERSON: Well, I think that it is the height of hypocrisy. And we saw it with Roy Moore as well.  If any other Democratic president had been guilty of what is alleged in these cases, evangelicals would be, you know, off the reservation.  This is a case where their morality seems to be determined by their politics. And they have ceased to be moral leaders in that sense. It's -- it was a tough choice for many evangelicals between Hillary Clinton and the president. And I understand that.  But they have been the most sycophantic element of the Republican coalition, which was -- is unnecessary. They have not provided that moral judgment that I think leavens our politics or should leaven our politics.  And so I have done this piece in \"The Atlantic\" essentially arguing that they have -- they are betraying a great tradition. Evangelicalism really has had a good tradition. And now they are really undermining that reputation of their faith.  BRENNAN: But, in that judgment, you are saying the transactional part of this relationship isn't worth the trade-off?  GERSON: Well, they are acting like, you know, slimy political operatives, not moral leaders.  They are essentially saying, in order to get benefits for themselves, in a certain way -- they talk about religious liberty and other issues -- but to get benefits for themselves, they are willing to wink at Stormy Daniels and wink at misogyny and wink at nativism.  And that, I think, is deeply discrediting, not just in a political sense, but actually in a moral and religious sense.  BRENNAN: Molly, I think a lot of people don't really know what to make of this scandal. It seems sordid, but now we are talking about it sort of bleeding into questions about campaign finance and further legal issues for the president, whose position has simply been, none of this ever happened, it is all made up.  BALL: Well, and he can say that, but that doesn't make it go away.  And I do think that we have seen this scandal have surprising staying power because of the legal issues involved. If it were simply yet another woman accusing Donald Trump of improper behavior, which she certainly is not the first, although, in this case, what is being alleged is a consensual extramarital affair, not, as in some other cases, a form of harassment -- in this case, though, there is this legal arbitration, this legal contract between the president's lawyer and Stormy Daniels, which the White House acknowledged this week exists, and is still going through an arbitration process.  And then there is this campaign finance technicality, although I think there is -- it is quite questionable whether that would actually be assessed by a court.  But you do have these issues where, because the president, through his lawyer, allegedly went to great lengths to try to silence this story and cover up this alleged affair, that this is not going to go away.  BRENNAN: Shannon, switching topics, the White House is expected today to announce some form of proposal when it comes to gun safety and school safety.  Do you know what it is they are putting forward?  PETTYPIECE: There's two things that, well, appear that they have been consistent on, school safety, certainly the additional resources for school safety, arming teachers, as controversial as it is. They have heard all the talking points for and against it. That is still an issue they are sticking with.  And what we can expect not to be in there is any sort of assault weapons ban, any sort of ban on AR-15s, anything that the really -- the pro-gun regulation camp would like to see. So, probably a little bit more than what the NRA would like, but certainly not as far as Democrats would like.  And as we started at the beginning of this conversation, it did seem like, at one point, the president was moving more towards the left on these issues. Of course, there was that famous lunch with the NRA. And since then, we have seen a back-walking of a lot of this.  BALL: Well, and I think this actually goes back to the tariffs issue, because what Republicans in Congress and elsewhere are used to seeing Trump do is say something that goes against their longtime policy predilection, say like, oh, we are going to take on the NRA, and then not do it.  And so, in policy terms, they have been comfortable that they could talk him down off the ledge of whatever non-conservative thing his instincts were heading him in the direction of. On tariffs, they thought they could do the same thing. The president would promise all kinds of things, and then they would be able to walk him back.  And I think we are still seeing that process play out, where they still think that they can carve out enough exemptions to this announced tariff, that the president doesn't actually do something that bothers conservatives.  PETTYPIECE: Well, and, of course, Republicans will have the say at the end of the day, because it is up to Mitch McConnell to actually bring something to the floor.  And as -- even something as simple as bump stocks, once you put that on the floor, it opens Pandora's box, and a whole lot of amendments and other things can come out.  BRENNAN: And we should acknowledge the Justice Department came forward showing that they actually are trying to move forward with that sort of executive action to ban bump stocks.  Susan, this announcement on North Korea seemed to overshadow everything else that happened during what was already kind of a rocky week, with tariffs, and Stormy Daniels, with all the rest.  Is the president putting himself out a limb by doing this, or is it a strategic way of changing the topic?  GLASSER: Well, strategic might not be the right word.  But, listen, this is -- if you want to know what the Trump presidency is like and could be even more like in the future, this week is an incredible example of that.  I was going over in my head before this conversation all the things that happened. It was only at the beginning of this week, remember, that President Trump told us that there is no chaos in his White House, only great energy.  And we thought that the prospect of a trade war was going to be the dominant story. It hasn't gone away just because we are not talking about it as much.  We saw that the Stormy Daniels story would be a dominant narrative. There's the Mueller investigation. There is the real question of what this internal disruption in the White House and the lack of senior staff is really going to mean going forward.  In my view, this is -- you know, Trump seems very happy with where he is at, right? He seems like this is the White House that he wants. He doesn't want to be managed. He doesn't want to be constrained. He wants it to be all about him at all times.  And if he changes the subject, he wants us to run along right behind him.  BRENNAN: And we are right now.  GLASSER: And we are.  (LAUGHTER)  BRENNAN: And we will be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching.  Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 They spent their first year in Washington as an untouchable White House power couple, commanding expansive portfolios, outlasting rivals and enjoying unmatched access to the president. But Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have undergone a swift and stunning reckoning of late, their powers restricted, their enemies emboldened and their future in the West Wing uncertain. Kushner, long the second-most powerful man in the West Wing, is under siege. President Donald Trump's son-in-law has lost influential White House allies. He remains under the shadow of the Russia probe and has seen his business dealings come under renewed scrutiny. He has been stripped of his top security clearance, raising questions how he can successfully advance his ambitious agenda \u2014 including achieving Mideast peace, a goal that has eluded presidents for generations. Kushner's most powerful patron, the president himself, has wavered recently on whether his daughter and son-in-law belong in the White House anymore. A frustrated Trump has griped about the wave of bad headlines generated by probes into Kushner's business dealings and the status of his security clearance, according to two people familiar with the president's thinking but not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations. The president also has wondered aloud if the couple would be better off returning home to New York. At the same time, though, Trump has said he believes many of the attacks against Kushner are unfair and has lamented that the couple is going through such a turbulent time, according to the two people close to the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about Trump's private comments. \"I think he's been treated very unfairly,\" Trump said late last month. \"He's a high-quality person.\" Kushner's woes mushroomed in the past month, when accusations of spousal abuse emerged against White House staff secretary Rob Porter. Initially, the resulting firestorm \u2014 including questions about how Porter had interim clearance for top-secret information despite red flags in his background \u2014 threatened to engulf Chief of Staff John Kelly, the retired Marine hired to bring order to Trump's chaotic West Wing. Kelly seemed to stabilize his own standing, in part by ordering a reform of the White House security clearance process. And among senior aides, that change fell the hardest on Kushner, who had been working with interim access to top-secret information. And he was doing that as investigators worked through his family's complicated real estate dealings and as special counsel Robert Mueller probes Russian connections to the Trump team. A week ago, Kushner's security clearance level was downgraded, leaving White House aides to wonder just how many indignities Kushner and Ivanka Trump are willing to suffer. Even if recent events and revelations don't trigger a departure, they have demonstrated that the West Wing clout of \"Javanka,\" as the couple is often referred to, is a far cry from what it once was. Since taking office last year, Kelly has prioritized creating formal lines of authority and decision-making. Kushner resisted efforts to formalize his role \u2014 which early in the administration made him something of a shadow secretary of state \u2014 and he has grown frustrated with the chief of staff's attempts to restrict the couple's access to the president. The couple perceives Kelly's crackdown on security clearances as a direct shot at them, according to White House aides and outside advisers. But one White House official disputed that account, suggesting that Kushner welcomed Kelly's efforts to organize the West Wing, allowing him to more singularly focus on his portfolio. Kelly, in turn, has been angered by what he views as the couple's freelancing. He blames them for changing Trump's mind at the last minute and questions what exactly they do all day, according to one White House official and an outside ally. Kushner prevailed in previous power struggles within the White House, including one against former chief strategist Steve Bannon, but allies of the president on the outside openly cheered the power couple's weakened position. \"Only a son-in-law could withstand this sort of exposure and not be fired,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, former communications director for President Barack Obama. \"Kushner's vulnerable and in an accelerated fall from grace. Even though his departure would leave Trump even more isolated, a decision could be made that it's just not worth it for him to stay.\" Those close to the couple insist the duo has no plans to leave Washington. But a soft landing spot has emerged if they choose to take it. At a senior staff meeting Wednesday, Kushner spoke about the 2020 campaign at Kelly's behest, talking up the selection of Brad Parscale to run the campaign, according to an administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly about internal discussions. Kushner has a close relationship with Parscale, whom he recruited to work on the 2016 campaign. News of Parscale's appointment was first reported in the Drudge Report, a favored outlet of Kushner's, in a move that was seen by some in the West Wing as an attempted reminder of Kushner's clout just hours before his humbling security clearance downgrade became public. One veteran of the 2016 campaign suggested that there had always been a tentative plan for Kushner to resume a role on the re-election campaign but not this early in the president's first term. In a White House populated with attention-seekers, Kushner has been an ascetic, discreet figure. Almost always standing at the periphery in dark business suits, Kushner is rarely heard in public, his impact felt but not seen. His diplomatic trips abroad have either been shrouded in secrecy or conducted with minimal media coverage. \"I am not a person who has sought the spotlight. First in my business and now in public service, I have worked on achieving goals, and have left it to others to work on media and public perception,\" Kushner told congressional investigators in a prepared statement last July. But it is not immediately obvious what he's achieved. There has been little progress on Mideast peace and relations with Mexico, another top Kushner priority, remain contentious over Trump's proposed border wall. Kushner's much ballyhooed project to reinvent the federal government has gained little traction. And questions persist about his family business's global hunt for cash just a year before a $1.2 billion mortgage on a Manhattan skyscraper must be paid off by the company. The Kushner Co. says it is in solid financial shape, but skeptics note that the company has been scrambling to raise funds from investors in nations with which Kushner has had government dealings and questions about potential Kushner conflicts of interest have scuttled some efforts. Ivanka Trump, meanwhile, promotes the administration's tax overhaul, including a family-friendly tax credit she championed. She continues to talk with lawmakers about paid family leave and recently led the U.S. delegation to the closing ceremonies at the Winter Olympics in South Korea. But her role has come with unique challenges and calculations. Trump has portrayed herself as an advocate for women and families within the administration, which at times puts her in an awkward position given the allegations against her father and some of his public comments about women. Trump recently said in an NBC interview that she believes her father's denials of sexual misconduct, but argued that questions to her on the topic were \"pretty inappropriate\" \u2014 an answer that prompted eyerolls in some quarters of the West Wing yet again. Some West Wing observers suggested that the mercurial president, who prizes loyalty and family, could at some point move to re-establish Kushner and Ivanka Trump's clout. But at Washington's annual Gridiron Dinner on Saturday, he opted for a laugh line about their situation. \"But before I get started, I wanted to apologize for arriving a little bit late,\" Trump said. \"You know, we were late tonight because Jared could not get through security.\"",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump unveiled a $4.4 trillion budget plan Monday that envisions steep cuts to America's social safety net but mounting spending on the military, formally retreating from last year's promises to balance the federal budget. The president's spending outline for the first time acknowledges that the Republican tax overhaul passed last year would add billions to the deficit and not \"pay for itself\" as Trump and his Republican allies asserted. If enacted as proposed, though no presidential budget ever is, the plan would establish an era of $1 trillion-plus yearly deficits. The open embrace of red ink is a remarkable public reversal for Trump and his party, which spent years objecting to President Barack Obama's increased spending during the depths of the Great Recession. Rhetoric aside, however, Trump's pattern is in line with past Republican presidents who have overseen spikes in deficits as they simultaneously increased military spending and cut taxes. \"We're going to have the strongest military we've ever had, by far,\" Trump said in an Oval Office appearance Monday. \"In this budget we took care of the military like it's never been taken care of before.\" President Trump is proposing a $4 trillion-plus budget that projects a $1 trillion or so federal deficit. AP's Economic Reporter Josh Boak says the plan is like a 'Christmas list, a wish list' that amounts amounts to a 'massive bet'. (Feb. 12) Trump's budget revived his calls for big cuts to domestic programs that benefit the poor and middle class, such as food stamps, housing subsidies and student loans. Retirement benefits would remain mostly untouched by Trump's plan, as he has pledged, though Medicare providers would absorb about $500 billion in cuts \u2014 a nearly 6 percent reduction. Some beneficiaries in Social Security's disability program would have to re-enter the workforce under proposed changes to eligibility rules. While all presidents' budgets are essentially dead on arrival \u2014 Congress writes and enacts its own spending legislation \u2014 Trump's plan was dead before it landed. It came just three days after the president signed a bipartisan agreement that set broad parameters for spending over the next two years. That deal, which includes large increases for domestic programs, rendered Monday's Trump plan for 10-year, $1.7 trillion cuts to domestic agencies such as the departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development even more unrealistic. The White House used Monday's event to promote its long-awaited plan to increase funding for infrastructure. The plan would put up $200 billion in federal money over the next 10 years in hopes of leveraging a total of $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending, relying on state and local governments and the private sector to contribute the bulk of the funding. But after his aides talked up that plan over the weekend, Trump suggested that his infrastructure proposal wasn't a big deal for him. \"If for any reason, they don't want to support to it, hey, that's going to be up to them,\" he said of the Republican-controlled Congress. \"What was very important to me was the military; what was very important to me was the tax cuts.\" Trump also is proposing work requirements for several federal programs, including housing subsidies, food stamps and Medicaid. Such ideas have backing from powerful figures in Congress including Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who promises action on a \"workforce development\" agenda this year. There was immediate opposition from Democrats. \"The Trump budget proposal makes clear his desire to enact massive cuts to health care, anti-poverty programs and investments in economic growth to blunt the deficit-exploding impact of his tax cuts for millionaires and corporations,\" said Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Some Republicans, on the other hand, said spending was much too high. \"This budget continues too much of Washington's wasteful spending \u2014 it does not balance in ten years, and it creates a deficit of over a trillion dollars next year,\" said Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida. \"We cannot steal from America's future to pay for spending today Trump's plan aims at other familiar targets. It would eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The administration wants NASA out of the International Space Station by 2025 and private businesses running the place instead. But the domestic cuts would be far from enough to make up for the plummeting tax revenue projected in the budget. Trump's plan sees a 2019 deficit of $984 billion, though White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney admits $1.2 trillion is more plausible after last week's congressional budget pact and $90 billion worth of disaster aid is tacked on. That would be more than double the 2019 deficit the administration promised last year. All told, the new budget sees accumulating deficits of $7.2 trillion over the coming decade; Trump's plan last year projected a 10-year shortfall of $3.2 trillion. And that's assuming Trump's rosy economic predictions come true and Congress follows through \u2014 in an election year \u2014 with politically toxic cuts to social programs, farm subsidies and Medicare providers. Last year Trump's budget promised such ideas could generate a small budget surplus by 2027; now, his best-case scenario is for a $450 billion deficit that year, more than $300 billion of which can be traced to his December tax cut. In stark numbers, the budget rewrites the administration's talking points for last year's tax plan, which administration figures such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin promised would more than pay for itself. \"Not only will this tax plan pay for itself, but it will pay down debt,\" Mnuchin declared in September. Instead, Trump's budget projects that tax revenues will plummet by $3.7 trillion over the 2018-27 decade relative to last year's \"baseline\" estimates. The budget also includes $1.6 billion for the second stage of Trump's proposed border wall, a 65-mile segment in Texas' Rio Grande Valley. Trump's request last year for 74 miles of wall in San Diego and the Rio Grande Valley is pending before lawmakers right now. Once again, there's no mention of how Mexico would have to pay for it, as Trump repeatedly promised during the presidential campaign and after his victory. The plan reprises proposals to curb crop insurance costs, cut student loan subsidies and reduce pension benefits for federal workers. They went nowhere last year. Trump's plan promises 3 percent growth for the nation's economy, continuing low inflation and low interest yields on U.S. Treasury bills despite a flood of new borrowing. That likely underestimates the mounting cost of financing the government's $20 trillion-plus debt, many economists say. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said a surge in stimulus from higher government spending and tax cuts would boost growth but for only for a short time. \"This will meaningfully raise the odds that after juiced-up growth in 2018 and 2019, we will get a much weaker economy, possibly a recession in the next decade,\" Zandi said. \"In good times, budget policy should be working to get the deficits down because bad times are sure to come.\"",

            "article_content": "For the fourth time this year, the government is on the brink of a shutdown. The House will vote on a \"minibus\" appropriations package on Friday, which includes funding for the Department of Defense, the Labor Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Education Department, accompanied by a resolution to keep the government open until Dec. 7. It also includes nearly $9 billion in relief for areas affected by Hurricane Florence.\u00a0 If the package of bills passes the House, there's one more hurdle before the government can truly be funded: President Trump's signature. But Mr. Trump is displeased with the bill because it does not include funding for the border wall between the United States and Mexico. Members of Congress are concerned that a presidential veto and a government shutdown could impact the midterm elections, giving Democrats even more leverage in their quest to retake the House. However, Mr. Trump believes that a shutdown could benefit Republicans before the midterms, since it may encourage Republican voters to turn out because they want a border wall. \"I happen to think it's a great political thing, because people want border security,\" Mr. Trump said on Rush Limbaugh's radio show in July. Mr. Trump's views on a shutdown have wavered, in some cases from one day to the next. Earlier in September, in an interview with the Daily Caller, Mr. Trump said \"I don't like the idea of shutdowns.\" He added that he didn't \"see even myself or anybody else closing down the country right now.\" The next day, Mr. Trump reversed course in a meeting with Republican lawmakers. \"If it happens, it happens. If it's about border security, I'm willing to do anything,\" Mr. Trump said. The president criticized the bill more vehemently on Twitter last week. \"I want to know, where is the money for Border Security and the WALL in this ridiculous Spending Bill, and where will it come from after the Midterms? Dems are obstructing Law Enforcement and Border Security. REPUBLICANS MUST FINALLY GET TOUGH!\" Mr. Trump wrote.\u00a0 I want to know, where is the money for Border Security and the WALL in this ridiculous Spending Bill, and where will it come from after the Midterms? Dems are obstructing Law Enforcement and Border Security. REPUBLICANS MUST FINALLY GET TOUGH! Mr. Trump has requested $5 billion for his wall, but Republicans in the Senate do not have the votes to pass that amount of funding. The minibus sidesteps the issue by not addressing the wall at all. The Senate passed the minibus last week, with only seven senators voting against it. Some conservatives have expressed frustration that there is funding for Planned Parenthood in the bill, but not for the border wall. \"This bill funds things we said we wouldn't, like Planned Parenthood, but doesn't fund things we said we would, like the border security wall. That's unacceptable,\" Jordan told the Associated Press. The government was shut down for two days in January, and for a few hours in February. Mr. Trump threatened not to sign a funding bill in March, but did so hours before the deadline. If the minibus bill is passed on Friday, the House is expected to cancel the two weeks of session in October, and reconvene after the midterm elections, on Nov. 13.

            "article_content": "TIJUANA, Mexico\u00a0-- About 2,000 migrants from the Central American caravan are at America's doorstep and another 1,200 from a second caravan set out from Mexico City toward the border Friday.\u00a0With\u00a0U.S. border inspectors\u00a0processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at the main border crossing with San Diego, prospects grew that migrants would be stuck waiting in Tijuana for months. \u00a0 The first group split from a larger group of about 5,000 planning to request asylum in the U.S. The caravan has fragmented somewhat in recent days in a final push to the border, with some migrants moving rapidly in buses and others falling behind. With shelters already full, authorities in Tijuana opened a gymnasium and gated sport complex for up to 1,000 migrants, with a potential to expand to 3,000. But at least that many migrants were still on the road or trickling into the city aboard buses, and a third caravan was still waiting in Mexico City.\u00a0 Tijuana faces a potential influx of as many as 10,000 in all. The city's privately run shelters are meant to have a capacity of 700. Francisco Rueda, the top deputy to Baja California state Gov. Francisco Vega de la Madrid, said, \"This is not a crisis,\" but agreed that \"this is an extraordinary situation.\" To claim asylum in San Diego, migrants enter their names in a tattered notebook held together by duct tape and managed by the migrants in a plaza outside the entry to the main border crossing. On Thursday, migrants who registered six weeks ago were getting their names called. The waiting list has grown to more than 3,000 names and stands to become much longer with the new arrivals. Rueda said that if all migrants from the caravan currently in Tijuana were to register to seek asylum in the U.S., they would likely have to wait four months at current processing rates. For that reason, the state has asked Mexican federal authorities to encourage people in other caravans to go to other border cities. Concerns continued about what the Central Americans will do, or how they will support themselves in the meantime. Rueda said the state has 7,000 jobs available for its \"Central American migrant brothers\" who obtain legal residence status in Mexico. \"Today in Baja California there is an employment opportunity for those who request it, but in order for this to happen, it has to regulate migrant status,\" he said. The thriving factories in the city of 1.6 million are always looking for workers, and several thousand Haitian migrants who were turned away at the U.S. border have found jobs and settled in Tijuana the last two years. Migrant caravans heading to the U.S. became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections. President Trump\u00a0ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border and has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\u00a0 Many say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. \u00a0\u00a0",

Good to see you in person. SENATOR JONI ERNST: Thank you, Margaret. Thank you. It's great to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president gave an interview this morning to Fox's Chris Wallace and he said that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen needs to be much tougher on the border. What is she doing wrong? SEN. ERNST: Well, I think that she has done a good job. I think the president is just very frustrated, of course, with what we see at the border. We do have a large number of- of immigrants that are trying to get over the border illegally and we do need to make sure that we've got plenty of surveillance, that we have plenty of officers ready to respond. I think her response has been well so far, we as Congress need to step forward and do the next steps. MARGARET BRENNAN: She should continue in the role? \u00a0 SEN. ERNST: I think that she's done a good job, but of course, any of our secretaries or cabinet members serve at the pleasure of the president. It's entirely up to him who serves in those positions. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're a vet. Is deploying 6,000 troops to the border a good use of resources? SEN. ERNST: Well I- again, up to the president and of course those governors that are involved if they're National Guard soldiers. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on Armed Services, you have a voice. SEN. ERNST: If they are active duty soldiers it does actually provide them an opportunity for real life training in their roles. Many of them, if they serve in logistics type positions they will actually be doing those missions on the border. So it is a very good skill. As someone who has commanded troops both in peacetime and in wartime to make sure that they keep their skills sharp. And so when they do deploy, they are in harm's way overseas. They know exactly how to support the- the men and women on the frontlines. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's how you see- I know General Mattis said- Secretary Mattis has \u00a0said they won't even have any contact with people coming across. SEN. ERNST: Exactly, but they will be utilized in the roles. Like I said many of them may be logistics professionals serving in our armed services. And then it gives them greater opportunity to respond quickly in those types of situations, whether they are supporting with food or body armor, whatever it might be for Border Patrol agents. It allows those Border Patrol agents to actually focus on the law enforcement duties. MARGARET BRENNAN: As we introduce you, you are the first female senator to be in a leadership position of the GOP in a decade. But the number of women- Republican women in the house is at a 24 year low. We have never seen a Republican woman in the House or Senate in the whip leader or speaker positions. Now from these midterm results we're seeing female voters breaking from the party. Does the Republican Party have a problem with women? SEN. ERNST: Well, I think we need to encourage more women to run for office. I think we really can do much better in that area and then encourage them to seek responsibilities as leaders. So I was really really honored to be elected into our Republican leadership in the Senate. We have to have quality candidate- candidates out there and again encourage them to run, we need to be-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that the problem in the primaries that you saw, where some women were running but not winning? SEN. ERNST: Well, part of that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it the- is the issue with Republican men not voting for Republican female candidates? SEN. ERNST: I would say that part of that really is that we need to connect with our constituencies. We need to make sure that our voices are being heard. So whether it is focusing on health care priorities. Whether it is focusing on a national paid family leave opportunity for men and for women. Whatever those messages are, we need to communicate those and make sure that we are being heard when our constituents go to the polls. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you be doing anything to recruit more women? SEN. ERNST: Certainly I- I do visit with a number of women and I talk to Republican women. I see Democratic women when I'm in Iowa as well. And if they have a passion, if they believe in public service, I always encourage them to run, if that's their desire to serve the people of their- their potential district. We want them to step up and make their voices heard. MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think the president's rhetoric or what happened during the 2016 election is turning away women from the party overall-- SEN. ERNST: I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --voters or candidates? SEN. ERNST: I think that we could do a better job of communicating clearly that we support women and that's something that I try and do. I try and set a very strong example for women that want to run for office, women that wish to serve in the military. Whatever it might be, we need to set a good example. Women primarily, men secondarily, we need to step up and make sure that we are supporting the needs of our constituents. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something that really impacts your home state. The vice president said today- and he's in Asia, that the U.S. is not in a rush to end this trade dispute with China, suggesting that things might not get resolved when President Xi and Trump sit down in just a few weeks. There was a 12 billion dollar bailout for farmers, to help alleviate some of this pain. Will you need another one? SEN. ERNST: I am hopeful that we will not need another subsidy program for our farmers. Our farmers would much rather grow their goods and make sure that they are getting out to the rest of the world. Absolutely. But I've done a number of farmer roundtables all across the state of Iowa and at the last one I held, the very last speaker, a- a middle aged farmer, he-he stood up and said I understand why President Trump is doing this; however, what I don't understand is why someone didn't do it sooner. So they understand-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The pain is tolerable for now? SEN. ERNST: The pain is tolerable for now. \u00a0I want to see these trade deals done. I'd rather see them done sooner, rather than later, but we have to get a good deal with China or it's all for naught. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for joining us. SEN. ERNST: Thank you. Pleasure. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with a panel of some of the new House members.",

            "article_content": "The Senate late Wednesday approved a stopgap spending measure that will keep the government open until February without President Trump's requested $5 billion for a border wall. Mr. Trump has recently said he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government to get funding for the border wall.\u00a0 The spending measure now goes to the House of Representatives, and it has to be signed by Mr. Trump. While the White House indicated Mr. Trump was open to reviewing whatever Congress could pass, the president did not immediately weigh in on the short-term plan.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate will remain in session Thursday. \"We have to see what the House does,\" he said.  Many of Mr. Trump's supporters were frustrated that he appeared to retreat on his shutdown threats after promising a fight over the wall, which had been central to his presidential campaign. Just last week Mr. Trump said he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government over his demand for $5 billion for the wall. Some allies described the move as caving on his pledge, expressing concern that it could hurt Trump's 2020 prospects.  Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Trump's political base \"will just go crazy\" if he signs a bill without wall funding. He warned it will be tougher to win the money next year when Democrats control the House. He said supporters of the president \"believe it's a promise that he's been telling them that he will keep.\"  On Twitter, Mr. Trump appeared to respond to criticism by insisting that \"one way or the other, we will win on the Wall!\"  Mr. Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway also faced tough questioning on \"Fox & Friends,\" the morning show known to be one of Trump's favorites. Host Brian Kilmeade said Wednesday that Trump has \"no leverage,\" while Ainsley Earhardt asked why Mr. Trump was \"softening\" his position.  \"The president is not softening his stance,\" Conway said. \"He has a responsibility to keep the government moving forward, and he has a responsibility to get border security.\"  McConnell, though, portrayed the short-term spending measure as a \"simple\" bill that would show that Republicans, who control Congress now, will finish the year by not prolonging a potential crisis.  \"Republicans will continue to fill our duty to govern,\" he said.  Voting was delayed until late Wednesday as a bipartisan group of lawmakers, mostly from the West, sought to include language reauthorizing a popular program that supports conservation and outdoor recreation projects. The Land and Water Conservation Fund expired Sept. 30, and they've been trying to extend it, but no agreement was reached and talks will continue.  At one point late in the late evening, senators broke out in a round of Christmas carols from a corner of the chamber. A few moments later, retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., gaveled a procedural vote closed by suggesting \"Rudolph\" had voted present.  It was unclear how many House members would return to Washington for votes after Republicans lost the majority in the midterm election. Some 70 members missed Wednesday's session, almost as many Democrats as Republicans.  With Republicans sour on the spending package, passage could depend on Democrats.  Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi, who is on track to become speaker when Democrats take control Jan. 3, signaled support for ensuring funding.  Should the legislation become law, the border money fight would drag into the next Congress, which could prove even more difficult for Mr. Trump.  Pelosi will probably be able to quickly win approval of a longer-term measure to keep government running in 2019.  \"Democrats will be ready to fully, responsibly fund our government in January,\" Pelosi said in a statement.  As some Republicans grumbled that Mr. Trump caved, McConnell lashed out at Democrats for failing to give Trump any of the $5 billion that he wanted for the wall. The bill keeps funding at current levels, $1.3 billion, for border security and fencing, but not for the wall.  \"This seems to be the reality of our political moment,\" McConnell said. \"It seems like political spite for the president may be winning out over sensible policy.\"  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Democrats oppose Trump's border demands because the wall is \"inefficient\" and because Trump, as a candidate, promised that Mexico would pay for it, which Mexico has refused to do.  \"We want smart, effective border security,\" Schumer said. \"That's not a wall.\"  But the White House showed its willingness to budge as it became apparent the president did not have support in Congress for paying for the wall.  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders indicated earlier this week that Mr. Trump did not want to shut down the government. She said the administration was looking at ways to find the money elsewhere, though that was uncertain because it would also likely need congressional approval.  Congress did pass legislation to fund much of the government through the current budget year, until next Oct. 1.  At issue is money for nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies, including the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture, State and Justice, as well as national parks and forests.  The stopgap measure would approve government funding at existing levels for those departments, without a boost for the border. It would include a temporary extension of a national flood insurance program, the Violence Against Women Act and other measures.  Several lawmakers have complained that the appropriations process continues to be tangled in partisan politics. Top appropriators had tried to improve the process this year by passing bipartisan bills that would have funded those agencies, as they hoped to stem the cycle of shutdown crises. They lamented having to abandon those efforts for the temporary measure.  Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said they \"worked a long time\" on the bills, but hope \"evaporated\" as the shutdown risk deepened.  Many agencies, including the Pentagon and the departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, are covered for the year and would continue to operate as usual. The U.S. Postal Service, busy delivering packages for the holiday season, would not be affected by any government shutdown because it's an independent agency. This is a breaking story. It will be updated.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "While many Americans form their New Year's resolutions, President Trump on New Year's Eve aired his grievances and defended his legacy. The president fired off a flurry of tweets Monday as 2018 concludes with a government shutdown, controversy over troop withdrawal plans in the Middle East, and staffing upheavals.\u00a0 Mr. Trump is entering 2019 and the halfway mark of his term in office with a partial government shutdown over his border wall, a shutdown that Republican\u00a0Sen. Richard Shelby\u00a0says could last a \"long time.\" The president has been forced to defend himself in the wake of Defense Secretary James Mattis' resignation, which came shortly after Mr. Trump's announced withdrawal of troops from Syria. Mr. Trump's outgoing chief of staff John Kelly is speaking out and claiming the administration long abandoned a plan for a concrete border wall. And Democrats officially take control of the House, including all the investigatory powers that entails, later this week.\u00a0 Without mentioning Kelly directly, Mr. Trump \u2014 who has lately suggested the wall could be fencing or \"steel slats,\" claimed a concrete wall was \"NEVER ABANDONED.\"\u00a0 \"An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media,\" the president tweeted Monday morning. \"Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!\" Mr. Trump also took to Twitter to defend his plan to pull thousands of troops from the Middle East, suggesting he has wanted to do so all along.\u00a0 \"If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President, they would be a national hero. ISIS is mostly gone, we're slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants...I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places,\" the president tweeted. \"Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived, like to complain about me & my tactics, which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do!\" Mr. Trump, who submitted paperwork to run in 2020 on his first day in office in 2017, is nearing his term's halfway mark and looking towards his next election, aiming to prove to his base that he's kept his promises. The latest Gallup poll from Dec. 22, the first day of the shutdown, has Mr. Trump at 39 percent approval, 55 percent disapproval.\u00a0 The president is appearing on Fox News Channel New Year's Eve night to talk about the government shutdown, in what will be his first TV appearance since the partial shutdown began 10 days ago. Mr. Trump has remained in the White House during the holiday shutdown, tweeting at one point that he was \"all alone\" in the White House \"(poor me),\" waiting on Democrats to make a deal. But even Republicans are unclear exactly what the president would sign to end the shutdown. \u00a0 Later Monday morning, the president tweeted, \"I'm in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes, but with me in office, I'll get it built, and Fast!\" But reporters at the White House noted that no Marine was guarding the West Wing, as is protocol when the president is indeed in the West Wing.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, that aired Sunday, Dec. 23, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons. He joins us from Wilmington this morning. Welcome to \"Face The Nation.\" I know there was a lot that you want to respond to there, very quickly on the shutdown White House says they will accept less than five billion Democrats offering one point three for this border wall. How does this end?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, it ends when President Trump recognizes that the bipartisan agreement we came to just last Wednesday that the Senate voted unanimously on is the agreement that ultimately he's going to have to accept. It's President Trump who two weeks ago said, \"I will cheer on a government shutdown. I will champion a government shutdown. I will take responsibility for a shutdown\" -- and here we are with a government shutdown. There is frankly no path towards his getting five billion dollars in American taxpayer money to meet his campaign promise of a big, beautiful wall with Mexico. There is a path towards our responsibly appropriating about one point three billion for border security. Margaret, I'll remind you the administration hasn't spent yet the one point three billion we appropriated for border security this year. I think the president simply needs to hear, \"yes.\" And we all need to move forward.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see what happens in the New Year and possibly the new Congress there. Back to foreign policy. I know you heard a lot from Senator Paul there.\u00a0SEN. COONS: Yes, I did.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to what he laid out, which is just the president is doing what he was elected to do - these are forever wars?\u00a0SEN. COONS: I could not disagree more. I think by abruptly withdrawing from Syria, President Trump is handing a great big Christmas gift to Vladimir Putin of Russia and to the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran. And it's a pretty clear guidepost for me when there is a foreign policy decision that's cheered by Vladimir Putin and Rand Paul, that's a pretty good sign it's a terrible idea. On a bipartisan basis members of the Senate are pleading with President Trump to reconsider. To think that possibly his most senior generals and most experienced military leaders might be right. We shouldn't fumble the ball on the five-yard line. The mission against ISIS where the United States built a coalition of dozens of countries is on the verge of winning, of completely shutting down ISIS in Syria. And for us to withdraw right now and abandon our Kurdish allies paves a highway for control of Syria for either Iran and Russia or Turkey - none of which is a good outcome - and profoundly disorients our allies who came into this fight alongside us and weren't consulted and weren't given enough of a heads up. I'm concerned about the security of Israel and what it does to Israel to have Iran strengthened on its immediate border. I'm concerned about the message this sends about how reliable an ally the United States is. And I'm concerned what it says about our ability to stick to a fight until it's won. The fight against ISIS is not won, and Brett McGurk's resignation and Secretary Jim Mattis' resignation and his dramatic letter of resignation make that very clear.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well you talk about that letter of resignation - the defense secretary saying it's not just pulling out--\u00a0SEN. COONS: That's right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --it's this broader principle of abandoning alliances, the broader principle he says of being clear eyed and recognizing threats from Russia and China for any new nominee who steps into that role potentially. What are you going to do if the defense secretary nominated agrees with the president?\u00a0SEN. COONS: Well, one of the things that was most striking about Secretary Jim Mattis was how broadly he was supported on a bipartisan basis. Someone who spent 40 years both in combat commands and in policy commands. And was at the most senior and seasoned level of the American armed forces. If the president instead chooses an :America first\" defense secretary we will have confirmation hearings, we'll hopefully get the chance to ask him or her probing questions. But if it's someone who doesn't believe in the importance of our alliances as Secretary Mattis did - if this is someone who doesn't have a clear-eyed view of the very real threat to our security posed by both Russia and China then they won't get my support and they won't enjoy this sort of broad bipartisan support that Secretary Mattis has for so long.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Coons, I also want to ask you about something I know you've raised a red flag about. We have seen a real rough year lately for stocks, certainly a rough week and markets were rattled by some of these reports that the president is considering trying to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. I know the Treasury secretary and chief of staff both say he does have the power to do it. You have warned about the dangers of any kind of interference. Is there anything that Congress can do to stop this?\u00a0SEN. COONS: Well, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, my friend and a Republican and conservative, joined with me in sending a letter to the president directly a few weeks ago saying please don't criticize Jay Powell and The Fed, their decision making. That's an abrupt change in practice by the president to publicly criticize their decision making. Now he's reportedly considering an even bolder and less wise move in considering firing Jay Powell or demoting him. That got a very sharp response from the markets. This was the worst week for the American stock markets in a decade and that is as strong a signal as I think you can get from our economic policy leaders. I think it would be just a terrible idea. Senator Flake and I have visited and worked with countries in the developing world in Africa where the president can pick up the phone and demand the central bank print more money or change their monetary policy in order to help the president's re-election prospects. Those countries have economies that are very unstable and not as secure and as prosperous as ours. The independence of The Fed is a key linchpin of American economic security. And I just- I plead with the president to reconsider what is a very dangerous course in economic policy.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Coons thank you for joining us. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "With each passing day, more migrants make it to Mexico's side of the U.S.-Mexico border. But for those who make it across, another difficult journey through the American asylum process, which requires them to prove they've fled persecution at home, awaits. More than 75 percent of asylum cases from Central America were denied from 2012 to 2017, CBS News' Adriana Diaz reports. Those odds aren't deterring a Nicaraguan family that Diaz met in Mexico. They hope to receive political asylum in the U.S. When asked why, Idenia Molina Rocha held up a newspaper. She said it shows her family on the front page, along with a photo of their home. They support those who are against their president, and they're being persecuted for those beliefs. Rocha claims that pro-government forces opened fire on her 14-year-old son in July and detonated a homemade bomb that lodged shrapnel in his leg, forcing him to hobble on crutches along the caravan route. Rocha's son said he was with a friend when they were shot at. He said his friend pushed him down and was killed. When they retreated to the mountains, he said people helped take the shrapnel out with nail clippers, but he thinks there are still pieces in his leg. Rocha said \"wanted\" signs for her family were posted in town, so they left Nicaragua, traversed Guatemala and eventually made it to southern Mexico. They stayed there a month and then word spread about a caravan approaching. Rocha, appealing directly to President Trump, said, \"I would get on my knees and beg.\" \"Don't send us back,\" she said. \"We're walking and scared. You say you will militarize the border but I pray to God that with our evidence of persecution you won't send us back. I fear for my family's life. Please Mr. Trump, open the doors for us, I beg you.\" After using the issue of migrant caravans as an election campaign issue, Mr. Trump has once again focused on it. In a series of tweets Friday, he questioned the motive of migrants who are planning to seek asylum in the U.S., calling it a \"BIG CON.\" ....their country\u2019s flag. Can this be possible? Yes, because it is all a BIG CON, and the American taxpayer is paying for it! One woman told CBS News' Diaz she won't cross illegally but will instead seek asylum at an official port of entry. She's part of a group of LGBT migrants that is among the early arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border. Many said they were persecuted in their home countries because of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Earlier in the journey in southern Mexico, Diaz met a transgender woman who claims she was targeted in Honduras by gang members and was attacked by more than a dozen armed men who broke into her home. She said she's been beaten up and has a scar from the attack but doesn't like to show it because it traumatizes her more. She fears for her life in Honduras since the gang members know where she lives and have a photo of her. Still, if she makes it to the U.S. border and presents her asylum case, the odds are against her.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The Senate approved a $147 billion package containing Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bills, the so-called \"minibus\" funding bill, \u00a092 yeas to 5 nays on Wednesday. The package now goes to the House for consideration before going to the White House for President Trump's signature. The bill provides Fiscal Year 2019 funding for several federal agencies: The bill also provides additional Overseas Contingency Operations/ Global War on Terrorism funding which is exempt from discretionary spending limits. This \"first minibus\" appropriations bill includes 3 of the 12 FY 2019 appropriations bills that need to be passed by October 1, the beginning of Fiscal Year 2019.\u00a0 If all three compromise spending packages are approved by both chambers and signed by President Donald Trump, they would account for nearly 90 percent of annual spending, including the military and most civilian agencies. Lawmakers would still need a short-term patch for a portion of the government, including the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Mr. Trump's long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Approval of the initial spending bill was so important to Republican leaders that they moved up a vote planned for Thursday, citing the threat of Hurricane Florence bearing down on the Southeast U.S. coast. The storm is expected to make landfall Friday or Saturday in the Carolinas and create havoc along the East Coast. The bill represents a marked departure from recent years, when Congress has routinely ignored agency-specific spending measures in favor of giant \"omnibus\" packages that fund the entire government all at once. Trump has said he won't sign another bloated bill, and lawmakers have been working to approve a series of smaller spending measures. \"The American people expect us to get our work done. If we continue to work together in a bipartisan manner, we can successfully fund nearly 90 percent of the federal government on time through regular order \u2014 something Congress has not been able to do in many years,\" said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Alabama.\u00a0 \"This package is not perfect, but that is the nature of compromise,\" added Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Appropriations panel. Leahy said he was concerned that the bill does not do enough to cover costs associated with a program that allows veterans to receive government-paid health care at private facilities. \"We do our veterans no favors when we make promises to them that we cannot keep,\" he said. While generally upbeat about the progress on spending legislation, lawmakers from both parties remain wary of a government shutdown, which Trump has threatened unless he gets billions of dollars for the wall \u2014 a key Trump campaign promise. None of the three packages under consideration address spending for the wall, and GOP leaders have said they prefer to address the issue after the midterm elections. \"We still are in favor of the wall, we still want to get funding for the wall, but we think the best time to have that discussion is after the election,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Fox News last week. McConnell said there's \"zero\" chance of a government shutdown. Even so, Mr. Trump held out the possibility of a shutdown, citing the need to protect the nation's border by following through on his signature campaign promise. \"If it happens, it happens,\" Mr. Trump said last week. \"If it's about border security, I'm willing to do anything.\" With Republicans running the White House and both chambers of Congress, GOP leaders worry that voters would blame them for a shutdown, worsening the party's prospects for retaining congressional control amid an anticipated \"blue wave\" for Democrats. The White House in a statement said Mr. Trump looks forward to signing the spending package, adding that it \"aligns with many of the administration's priorities.\" The three-bill bundle approved by the Senate on Wednesday features a $5.1 billion increase for the Department of Veterans Affairs, including $1.1 billion to pay for a law Mr. Trump signed in June to give veterans more freedom to see doctors outside the troubled VA system. The bill includes $44.6 billion for energy and water programs, including programs to ensure nuclear stockpile readiness and spur innovation in energy research. The bill also funds flood-control projects and addresses regional ports and waterways. The bill would require Senate candidates to file electronic campaign finance reports \u2014 nearly two decades after the requirement was implemented in the House. Senate candidates currently file paperwork with the secretary of the Senate, who then sends it along to the Federal Election Commission, causing weekslong delays in electronic filing. House and Senate negotiators nixed several partisan policy riders in the House version, including one that would have repealed the Obama-era Clean Water Rule and another to limit spillovers at dams in the Pacific Northwest to protect salmon.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Russia said on Wednesday it still expects a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump to go ahead as planned. Mr. Trump, in an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday, said he may cancel the sit-down with Putin in Argentina following Russia's seizure of three Ukrainian naval ships last weekend. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that the meeting is on and that Russia has not received \"any other information from our U.S. counterparts.\" The long-simmering conflict between Russia and Ukraine burst into the open on Sunday, when Russian border guards fired on three Ukrainian vessels and seized the ships and the crew. Mr. Trump said he would be receiving a \"full report\" from his national security team on Russia's recent actions in eastern Ukraine and the Black Sea. He said he would decide on a course afterward. \"Maybe I won't have the meeting,\" he said. \"Maybe I won't even have the meeting.\" Mr. Trump added: \"I don't like that aggression. I don't want that aggression at all.\" The comments were his strongest to date in condemnation of Russia's recent actions in Ukraine, where tensions are flaring. But White House aides were still planning for the Putin meeting after Mr. Trump's comments. Russia says the Ukrainian vessels sparked the confrontation earlier this week by refusing to yield upon orders from Russian border forces to change their course inside Russian territorial waters (within 12 miles of Russia's coast). Putin personally reaffirmed on Wednesday his government's insistence that the Ukrainian convoy crossed into Russian territory and ignored orders to change course. Putin said it was a deliberate \"provocation\" by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, orchestrated to bolster his standing ahead of presidential elections next year. Putin said it was a deliberate move by Poroshenko to use as a \"pretext\" to implement martial law in parts of eastern Ukraine -- which was put in place on Wednesday. Ukraine's government has insisted it was Russian border guards who first rammed into and opened fire on the three Ukrainian navy vessels as they tried to make their way from the Black Sea toward a Ukrainian port.  On Monday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations called on Russia to \"immediately cease its unlawful conduct\" in the Black Sea near Crimea during a United Nations Security Council meeting called over the incident. \u00a0 \"We call on Russia to respect its international obligations and not obstruct or harass Ukraine's transit in the Kerch Strait, to release the seized Ukrainian ships and crew and to de-escalate the tensions it has created,\" Haley told the Council, CBS News' Pamela Falk reported.  The meeting between President Trump and Putin is set to be just one of several high-profile foreign-policy engagements for the U.S. leader on the whirlwind two-day visit to Argentina to attend this year's summit of the world's 20 biggest economies.  Mr. Trump also is set meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping over dinner this weekend, in what may be a pivotal session to determining if and how the ongoing trade dispute between their countries can be resolved. The White House on Tuesday warned Xi against trying to wait out Mr. Trump in the ongoing talks, suggesting the Chinese economy was not as resilient to a trade war as would be the U.S. economy. The warning from Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, came ahead of the two leaders' high-stakes sit-down on Saturday evening. Over the last year, the two countries have levied a series of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of imports from one another, with the latest round of U.S. duties set to go into force in the new year. National Security adviser John Bolton said Mr. Trump will also be meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Argentine President Mauricio Macri, South Korea's Moon Jae-in, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the trip an opportunity for the president to cement relations with other world leaders and advance a global economic system based on \"free, fair and reciprocal trade.\" The Trump-Xi meeting would be the first since the two countries began hitting each other with import taxes earlier this year. The United States targeted $250 billion in Chinese products, and Beijing lashed back by slapping tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods. The two sides have been in negotiations for months, but Kudlow described them as being stalemated until just a few weeks ago. Kudlow said the administration has been \"extremely disappointed\" by China's engagement in trade talks but the meeting between Mr. Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit could be a game-changer. \"Perhaps we can break through in Buenos Aires or not,\" he said. Kudlow added that if the U.S. doesn't get \"satisfactory\" responses to its trade positions more tariffs will be imposed. He said Mr. Trump is \"not going away.\" \"I hope they understand that,\" he said. China's foreign ministry has said a recent phone conversation between Xi and Mr. Trump about trade and other issues was \"extremely positive.\"",

            "article_content": "Chief Justice John Roberts is pushing back against President Trump's description of a judge who ruled against Mr. Trump's new migrant asylum policy as an \"Obama judge.\" It's the first time that the leader of the federal judiciary has offered even a hint of criticism of Mr. Trump, who has previously blasted federal judges who ruled against him. Mr. Trump had criticized U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar, who issued a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration Monday from\u00a0refusing asylum to immigrants who cross the southern border illegally. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that \"we're going to have to look at\" the Ninth Circuit Court, which had ruled against the administration on asylum. He added that \"every case\" that goes through that circuit results in \"an automatic loss\" for his administration. \"The 9th Circuit is very unfair.\" Roberts said Wednesday the U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.\" He commented in a statement released by the Supreme Court after a query by The Associated Press. Roberts said on the day before Thanksgiving that an \"independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\" Mr. Trump responded to Roberts on Twitter. \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \"Obama judges,\" and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an \"independent judiciary,\"\" Mr. Trump said in what appeared to be the first in a series of tweets. Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u201cObama judges,\u201d and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an \u201cindependent judiciary,\u201d but if it is why...... He continued in a second tweet, asking why \"are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. Please study the numbers, they are shocking. We need protection and security \u2014  these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!\" The 9th Circuit Court includes California and Arizona, which share a large border with Mexico, which would help to explain why border-related suits are filed in that court. Last year, the president used the term a \"so-called judge\" after the first federal ruling against his travel ban. He also criticized a Bush-appointed judge during the presidential election for his Mexican heritage.",

            "article_content": "Keep the government running and confirm Brett Kavanaugh as the next Supreme Court justice. Those are the big-ticket items that Republican leaders in Congress hope to accomplish as lawmakers look to wrap up their work and head home to campaign for the November elections. Democrats want to keep the government open, but they also are fighting to derail the nomination of Kavanaugh, the second Supreme Court nominee from President Donald Trump. Other items on the agenda when Congress returns Tuesday: passing a farm bill, renewing federal aviation programs, and grilling social media executives about foreign interference in their operations and whether they are biased against conservatives, as Trump has alleged. Republican leaders are expected at the White House on Tuesday for a meeting with Mr. Trump on their goals. A look at what's coming up on Capitol Hill: The Senate Judiciary Committee begins confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, on Tuesday with his introduction and opening statements from lawmakers. Questioning of the nominee will begin the next day and testimony from the American Bar Association, outside legal experts and those who know him best will follow. Mr. Trump nominated Kavanaugh to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy, considered the swing vote on some of the most important issues decided in recent years. Democrats are worried that Kavanaugh's confirmation will cement a right-leaning court for many years to come. They contend his elevation could lead the court to restrict a woman's right to choose an abortion, equal rights for gays and lesbians and environmental protections. With liberal advocacy groups adamantly opposed to Kavanaugh and Democrats wanting to fire up their base for the coming election, Senate questioning will be aggressive and opening statements forceful. But Republicans with their 50-49 majority have the edge. Lawmakers face a Sept. 30 deadline to pass spending bills to keep the government open. The House and Senate have both approved a series of measures, but have not agreed on a unified bill that could go the president's desk. Lawmakers hope to approve at least three compromise bills that fund a large portion of the government, including the military and most civilian agencies, before the new budget year begin Oct. 1. In a shift from previous years, the Senate has approved nine of 12 mandatory spending bills, enough to fund nearly 90 percent of the government. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called that \"an important step forward\" and evidence that \"Congress is in good hands\" under GOP majorities in the House and Senate. Still, lawmakers from both parties remain wary of a government shutdown, which Trump has threatened unless he gets a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats have resisted Mr. Trump's plan to spend $25 billion to fulfill that key Trump campaign promise. A shutdown just weeks before the November elections would be the third under unified Republican control of Washington, following stoppages in January and February. That prospect has provoked widespread anxiety among Republicans facing tough re-election fights. Trump has called a possible shutdown \"a great political thing, because people want border security.\" Congress has until Sept. 30 to reauthorize farm programs that, among other things, provide payments to farmers when prices for major crops decline. Pleas from farm groups for action come as they deal with the Trump administration's decision to use tariffs as leverage in trade disputes; major trading partners have responded with tariffs of their own on farm products from the U.S. The farm bill also would extend food aid for low-income Americans. House-passed legislation significantly tightens existing work requirements for aid recipients, an approach Mr. Trump has said he hopes makes it into the final bill. But the Senate version takes a more bipartisan approach and makes only modest changes to the food stamps, formally known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Led by Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., House Republicans have dug in on retaining work requirements in the bill. The two sides will begin hammering out a solution on Wednesday, when lawmakers start negotiating a compromise that can pass both chambers. Executives at some of the biggest social media companies will be on the hot seat in separate hearings this month. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg are scheduled to testify Wednesday before the Senate intelligence committee. Lawmakers want to know how their companies are dealing with efforts by Russia and other countries to influence social media platforms and interfere in U.S. elections. Dorsey is set to testify later Wednesday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which wants to know how Twitter monitors and polices content. Conservatives complain that Twitter is limiting their reach on the web, a cry that Trump has taken up. The first hearing is part of the Senate committee's Russia investigation. The committee is expected to issue additional reports in the coming weeks, including one on Russia's interference on social media. The committee has so far delayed a report on whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia; that report could come by the end of the year. Congress also has until Sept. 30 to extend FAA programs that fund airport and air traffic system improvements. If the FAA's authority were to expire, it would still continue to operate the nation's air traffic system and controllers would work without pay. But some of the agency's other work would come to a halt. The House passed a bill extending FAA activities for five years back in April, but action stalled in the Senate amid a dispute over rules for meals and rest breaks for truckers. The chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said lawmakers were pursuing \"all potential avenues to get the bill on the president's desk\" and signed into law before the deadline. The Senate bill includes new consumer protections, authority for developing new drone policies, safety enhancements and funding for aviation infrastructure.",

            "article_content": "JERUSALEM -- Children in Israel's south were heading to school early Wednesday as an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire took effect, putting an end to a brief yet intense flare-up with Gaza. The truce, announced Tuesday by Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip, came after nearly two days of heavy shelling from both sides that had threatened to descend into full-blown war. Gaza's Islamist Hamas rulers said they would abide by the ceasefire as long as Israel did the same. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was under intense pressure on Wednesday for accepting the truce -- including from his long-time defense chief who resigned his position and indicated a possible political challenge. Israel's Home Front Command removed late Tuesday all limitations on southern residents, sending children back to school after two days in shelters. At the United Nations Security Council held urgent consultations on Gaza Tuesday, and the U.N. Secretary-General's Deputy Spokesman Farhan Haq told CBS News' Pam Falk that the global body had worked \"very hard\" with Egypt \"to ensure that there is a return to the ceasefire arrangements of 2014.\" The U.N.'s Special Coordinator for Middle East Peace Process, \"believes that it is possible to deescalate this current round of violence in the interest of both Palestinians and Israelis,\" Haq told CBS News.  A diplomatic source close to the negotiations told Falk, however, that the \"situation remains very precarious and can blow up again.\"\u00a0 The latest violence, which saw seven Gazans killed in 24 hours as the Israeli aerial bombardment flattened buildings and sent fireballs and plumes of smoke into the sky, was the worst between Israel and Palestinian militants since a 2014 war. Sirens began sounding in southern Israel late Sunday, sending tens of thousands running for cover in shelters as around 460 rockets and mortar rounds were fired from Gaza, wounding 27 people, including three severely. A Palestinian labourer from the occupied West Bank was killed when a rocket hit a building in the Israeli city of Ashkelon.\u00a0 Netanyahu was forced to defend his decision to abide by the truce on Wednesday, facing sharp criticism from some Israeli citizens and the resignation of his defense chief, all of whom saw the move as a contrition to Hamas. Israel's hardline Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who made it clear on Tuesday that he did not support stopping the strikes, told lawmakers on Wednesday afternoon that he was resigning from his post and calling for early national elections. Lieberman officially announced his move later Wednesday in a televised address.\u00a0 \u00a0 He called the acceptance of the truce \"a capitulation to terror.\"\u00a0 Residents in the Israeli border town of Sderot, which is regularly hit by rockets from Gaza during flareups, were irate that Israel's military was holding its fire.\u00a0 \"Our government is doing whatever it wants, that's it. It only let us suffer, nothing more. We are third class (citizens) here in Sderot and (so are) the communities at the border with Gaza, not only Sderot,\" resident David Maimon told The Associated Press. \"It's a shame instead of helping us, let us live quietly, they let us suffer. We only suffer, for 18 years we have been suffering.\" Herzl Zigzag, another Sderot resident, told the AP that he would \"never vote for Netanyahu.\" \"People here are traumatized. Gaza is victorious, what is this nonsense? It can't continue like this,\" he said. But speaking later Wednesday at a ceremony to honor the founding father of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, Netanyahu said that, \"in times of emergency, when making decisions crucial to security, the public can't always be privy to the considerations that must be hidden from the enemy.\" \"Our enemies begged for a ceasefire and they knew very well why.\" In a statement issued late Tuesday, Egypt called on Israel to cease its \"military action\" in Gaza. \"Egypt's efforts have been able to achieve a ceasefire between the resistance and the Zionist enemy,\" the Gaza groups said. The flare-up began on Sunday with a botched Israeli special forces operation inside the Gaza Strip that turned deadly and prompted Hamas to vow revenge. The clash that resulted from the blown covert operation killed seven Palestinian militants, including a local Hamas military commander, as well as an Israeli army officer. Palestinian militants responded with rocket and mortar fire, as well as an anti-tank missile that hit a bus Hamas says was being used by Israeli soldiers. A soldier was severely wounded in the attack. Schools were closed in Gaza and in southern Israel on Tuesday as the two sides warned each other they would respond forcefully to any further violence.  After an Israeli security cabinet meeting that reportedly lasted some six hours on Tuesday, a statement was issued saying the ministers \"instructed the (military) to continue its operations as necessary.\" Missile defences intercepted more than 100 rockets from Gaza and most others fell in open areas, though some hit houses and other civilian structures. Ashkelon is just eight miles from the Gaza border, and as CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported on Tuesday, that makes it an easy target for Palestinian rockets.\u00a0 D'Agata and his crew saw the aftermath on Tuesday of one of the Hamas rockets, which hit an Israeli house. It blew a hole in the living room wall, where a woman was watching TV when the warning siren rang out. She begged her son to come with her to a reinforced safe room in the house, a move which may have saved both of their lives. Just minutes before the explosion, her son was in the shower. \"That's a close call,\" Baney told D'Agata. \"Within two seconds (after air sirens) we heard a huge boom, we saw our curtains flying in the air, windows (broken), and only after a few minutes when we went out, we realised that the missile had hit the building next to us,\" a man who lives near a block of flats hit by another rocket in Ashkelon said. Israel hit back with major air strikes, with targets including Hamas's Al-Aqsa TV station and internal security headquarters in Gaza City. The military said it struck some 160 targets in the enclave. \"What happened was like an earthquake,\" said Abu Ayman Lemzeni, who lives near the targeted TV building. At least five of the dead in Gaza were claimed as members of various militant groups. Some 26 other people were wounded in the Palestinian territory, according to Gaza's health ministry. The escalation came despite Netanyahu's decision to allow Qatar to transfer millions of dollars in aid to Gaza for salaries as well as fuel to ease an electricity shortage. The agreements had led to calmer protests along the Gaza border after months of deadly unrest. Sunday's special forces operation and resulting clash upset those efforts, leading to questions over the timing of the covert Israeli move. Israel said it was an intelligence-gathering operation and that those efforts must continue to defend the country. Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza have fought three wars since 2008, and protests and clashes along the Gaza border since March 30 have repeatedly raised fears of a fourth. At least 234 Palestinians in Gaza have since been killed by Israeli fire, the majority during protests and clashes. Two Israeli soldiers have been killed over the same period.",

Monday was the first day of early voting in Texas, and although O'Rourke has been trailing Cruz in recent polls, he hopes he can get a boost from enthusiastic first-time voters.\u00a0 \"We need to see record turnout and as you're seeing here today, so many people are telling us it's the first time they voted,\" O'Rourke told CBS News' Nancy Cordes in Houston on Monday. \"They've just become a citizen, they're forty years old, they've never voted in an election in their lifetime, but they're voting now. They only vote in presidential years, they're voting in a midterm for the first time. A lot of those folks are not reflected in the polls, but they're reflected at the polling site. And that's what's most important. That's how we win.\" The Houston Chronicle reported on Monday that a \"shocking\" number of people turned out to vote on Monday, creating \"a scene that looked more like a Black Friday shopping morning\" in the Lone Star State's most populous city. And given Houston's Democratic lean, the long lines could bode well for O'Rourke. Meanwhile, President Trump will be holding a campaign rally Monday night with Cruz in Houston. Mr. Trump is calling O'Rourke \"overrated\" and now has a couple of new nicknames for Cruz, formerly called \"Lyin' Ted\" by the president. Mr. Trump, as he was preparing to depart for the rally, said he and Cruz are now friends, and he refers to him as \"Texas Ted.\"\u00a0 Asked by Cordes about the migrant caravan making its way through Mexico, O'Rourke said that the U.S. should make sure it honors applicable asylum laws and address the underlying causes of migration. He suggested that should the caravan reach the U.S. border, some people in it should be reviewed for asylum.\u00a0 \"I think we need to do everything we can to address the underlying conditions in the countries from which those caravans come,\" O'Rourke said. \"Honduras in this case, but Guatemala and El Salvador, work with the country of Mexico to see if we can provide for those one the caravan there in that country. But if we try to decide this at our border, it's almost too late at that point. So, let's work with our, with our partners in these other countries, let's make sure that we honor our own asylum laws.\" If someone has nowhere else they can go to protect their families, themselves, and their kids, we have laws in the books, bars that they have to pass over -- including credible fear -- to ensure that they're following our laws, there's order in terms of how people come.\" The full interview with O'Rourke will appear on Monday's \"CBS Evening News with Jeff Glor.\"",

            "article_content": "In a rare group appearance at the White House briefing on Thursday, America's intelligence, law enforcement and national security chiefs sounded the alarm over Russian meddling in the upcoming midterm elections. Vowing a \"vast, government-wide\" response, the officials insisted that the president supported their effort to safeguard the nation's elections. The show of force was the White House's fiercest response to months of criticism that the president fails to take the Kremlin threat seriously. But hours later in Pennsylvania, President Trump decried the \"Russian hoax,\" appearing once again to cast doubt on his own intelligence community's warnings.  Also at the Pennsylvania rally, the president assured his supporters that \"we're going to start getting very nasty\" over the fight for border wall funding. Congress reacted skeptically this week to his threat to shut down the government over border security, in the wake of outcry over hundreds of immigrant children yet to be reunited with their parents and\u00a0several reports of abuse. Ivanka Trump made headlines this week when she not only said family separations were a \"low point\" for her, but also declined to label the media as the \"enemy of the people,\" as her father has often done. Asked to say the same\u00a0in a heated exchange with reporters on Thursday, the White House press secretary refused to rebut the president. And at his rally on Thursday, President Trump again laid into the \"horrendous people\" of the \"fake, disgusting news\" media. \u00a0 They asked my daughter Ivanka whether or not the media is the enemy of the people. She correctly said no. It is the FAKE NEWS, which is a large percentage of the media, that is the enemy of the people! In Virginia, Paul Manafort wrapped up his first week of trial on Friday. Charged with bank fraud, Manafort's attorney told CBS News Correspondent Paula Reid that there is \"no chance\" his client will cooperate with prosecutors. Sources close to the former Trump campaign chairman have speculated Manafort is betting on a presidential pardon, though top White House aide Kellyanne Conway denies there being any discussion of one. And in the latest escalation of the trade war with China, President Trump directed the U.S. Trade Representative to consider raising tariffs on an additional $200 billion of imports. As with previous tariffs, China condemned the move, warning of further economic countermeasures that threaten to erode economic success the president has trumpeted.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has returned from an end-of year holiday to face fresh legislative challenges, midterm elections and threats abroad. The president began the second year of his presidency with confrontational tweets targeting Iran and Pakistan. He slammed Islamabad on Monday for \"lies & deceit,\" saying the country had played U.S. leaders for \"fools,\" by not doing enough to control militants. Pakistani officials, including Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif, responded on Twitter that the country would make clear \"the difference between facts and fiction.\" Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Monday the United States should be aware that his country's nuclear forces are now a reality, not a future threat. To that, Trump only said: \"We'll see.\" The president is hoping for more legislative achievements after his pre-Christmas success on taxes. He plans to host Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin at Camp David next weekend to map out the 2018 legislative agenda. Ahead of the Camp David retreat, White House and Capitol Hill sources familiar confirmed to CBS News that the Republican and Democratic congressional leaders will also meet on Wednesday with senior administration officials to hold talks on government spending and other priorities for both sides.\u00a0 White House spokesman Hogan Gidley says budget director Mick Mulvaney and legislative affairs director Marc Short will attend the afternoon session, which is expected to focus on budget caps and what Gidley calls \"other legislative items.\"\u00a0 Republicans are eager to make progress before attention shifts to the midterm elections. The GOP wants to hold House and Senate majorities in 2018, but must contend with Trump's historic unpopularity and some recent Democratic wins. The president concluded 2017 with his first major legislative achievement \u2014 a law to cut taxes, beginning this year, for corporations and individuals at an estimated cost of $1.5 trillion added to the national debt over 10 years. The tax overhaul also will end the requirement, in 2019, that all Americans buy health insurance or pay a fine. That's a key component of the Obama-era health law that that Republicans have been unable to repeal; other features of the law remain intact. The White House has said Trump will come forward with his long-awaited infrastructure plan in January. Trump has also said he wants to overhaul welfare and recently predicted Democrats and Republicans will \"eventually come together\" to develop a new health care plan. Ryan has talked about overhauling Medicaid and Medicare and other safety-net programs, but McConnell has signaled an unwillingness to go that route unless there's Democratic support for any changes. Republicans will have just a 51-49 Senate majority \u2014 well shy of the 60 votes needed to pass most bills \u2014 giving leverage to Democrats. Congress also has to deal with a backlog from 2017. It must agree on a spending bill by Jan. 19 to avert a partial government shutdown. Lawmakers also have unfinished business on additional aid to for hurricane victims, lifting the debt ceiling, extending a children's health insurance program and extending protections for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Trump has said he wants money for a border wall in exchange for protecting those immigrants. Trump spent his last day in Florida as he spent most other days \u2014 visiting his golf course and tweeting. On Pakistan, he said: \"The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!\" It was not immediately clear why the president decided to comment on Pakistan. The U.S. has long accused Islamabad of allowing militants to operate relatively freely in Pakistan's border regions to carry out operations in neighboring Afghanistan. In August, the United States said it would hold up $255 million in military assistance for Pakistan until it cracks down on extremists threatening Afghanistan. On Iran, Trump kept up his drumbeat in support of widespread anti-government protests there. He tweeted Monday that Iran is \"failing at every level\" and it is \"TIME FOR CHANGE.\" While some Iranians have shared Trump's tweets, many distrust him as he's refused to re-certify the nuclear deal that eased sanctions on the country and because his travel bans have blocked Iranians from getting U.S. visas.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday lashed out at the Koch brothers, tweeting that the billionaire industrialists are a \"total joke in real Republican circles\" and that he is \"a puppet for no one.\" It's the latest salvo between the president and Charles and David Koch, who did not endorse Trump in his 2016 presidential bid and have lashed out at Mr. Trump's spending plans and trade policies. On Monday, the political advocacy network created by the billionaire industrialists announced it would not back the GOP candidate in the North Dakota Senate race. The decision was a warning shot to fellow Republicans that they should do more to elect candidates who challenge government spending. \"The globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"I never sought their support because I don't need their money or bad ideas.\" The globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade.

He later added: \"I'm for America First & the American Worker \u2014 a puppet for no one. Two nice guys with bad ideas.\" The globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade. I never sought their support because I don\u2019t need their money or bad ideas. They love my Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judicial picks & more. I made..... Mr. Trump was expected to travel to Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday to express support for his preferred candidate for governor in a competitive primary. The president was planning a rally in support of Rep. Ron DeSantis, who faces off against state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam in the state's Aug. 28 GOP primary. Mr. Trump tweeted early in the day that DeSantis has \"my Full & Total Endorsement!\" He cited the congressman's record on crime, border security, gun rights and taxes. Another Trump ally, Gov. Rick Scott, is joining the president at an event earlier in the day. Scott is seeking to defeat Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in a high-profile Senate race. Mr. Trump has played a role in several Republican primaries, helping candidates in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina in recent weeks with endorsements that underscore his influence within the GOP. But the president's policies have been at odds with the Kochs' political arm, Americans for Prosperity. The group says it still plans to focus its resources on helping Republican Senate candidates in Tennessee, Florida and Wisconsin. The duo announced back in January that they were prepared to spend upwards of $400 million to keep the House, Senate, state legislative chambers and governorships firmly in Republican hands come November. But Charles Koch told reporters in recent days that he cared little for party affiliation and regretted supporting some Republicans in the past who only paid lip service to conservative principles. Network leaders over the weekend repeatedly lashed out at the Republican-backed $1.3 trillion spending bill adopted in March, which represented the largest government spending plan in history. The Trump White House budget office now predicts that next year's federal deficit will exceed $1 trillion, while reaching a combined $8 trillion over the next 10 years. The Kochs were equally concerned about the Trump administration's \"protectionist\" trade policies, which have sparked an international trade war and could trigger a U.S. recession, Koch said. \"We're going to be much stricter if they say they're for the principles we espouse and then they aren't,\" Koch vowed. \"We're going to more directly deal with that and hold people responsible for their commitments.\"",

            "article_content": "TORONTO -- Marijuana will be legal nationwide in Canada starting Oct. 17 in a move that should take market share away from organized crime and protect the country's youth, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday. The Senate gave final passage to the bill to legalize cannabis Tuesday, legislation that will make Canada only the second country in the world to make pot legal across the country. Trudeau said provincial and territorial governments need the time to prepare for retail sales. \"It is our hope as of October 17 there will be a smooth operation of retail cannabis outlets operated by the provinces with an online mail delivery system operated by the provinces that will ensure that this happens in an orderly fashion,\" Trudeau said. The prime minister said at a news conference that the goal is to take a significant part of the market share away from organized crime. \"Over the following months and indeed years we will completely replace or almost completely replace the organized crime market on that,\" he said. Canada is following the lead of Uruguay in allowing a nationwide, legal marijuana market, although each Canadian province is working up its own rules for pot sales. The federal government and the provinces also still need to publish regulations that will govern the cannabis trade. \"The legislation is transformative,\" said Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, adding it \"marks a wholesale shift in how our country approaches cannabis, leaving behind a failed model of prohibition.. She urged Canadians to follow the existing law until the Cannabis Act comes into force. \"The law still remains the law,\" Wilson-Raybould said. Many questions remain unanswered, including how police will test motorists suspected of driving under the influence, what to do about those with prior marijuana convictions and just how the rules governing home cultivation will work. The Canadian provinces of Quebec and Manitoba have already decided to ban home-grown pot, even though the federal bill specifies that individuals can grow up to four plants per dwelling. \"Provinces can set their own laws. If individuals are challenging that law, they can challenge it,\" Wilson-Raybould said. Trudeau said the government won't discuss pardons of past convictions until legalization is in effect. \"There's no point looking at pardons while the old law is in the books,\" Trudeau said. Trudeau said they are going to treat it like wine and tobacco, noting that few people will cultivate it at home, but it's necessary to fight organized crime. Trudeau promised to legalize it during the 2015 election and had set a goal of July 1 for it. The provinces pleaded for more time. Canadian marijuana stocks have rallied in anticipation of legalization and jumped again on Wednesday. In the neighboring U.S., nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana. California, home to one in eight Americans, launched the United States' biggest legal marijuana marketplace on Jan. 1. The news was greeted with enthusiasm by marijuana advocates in the U.S. Don Hartleben, who manages Dank of America, a retail cannabis store just south of the border in Blaine, Washington, said Canada's legalization was not only politically exciting, but a potential business boon for him. Many of his customers are Canadian tourists who are terrified of trying to bring pot across the border, he said. If more use marijuana when they're in Canada, more will use when they're on vacation in the states. \"People ask me all the time, 'Isn't legalization in Canada going to hurt your business?'\" he said. \"I tell them, 'No! The more it's legal, the more people are going to feel safe to buy my product.'\"",

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon has a dire warning for Republicans. During a Sunday interview with The Associated Press, the former chief strategist to President Donald Trump said he believes the GOP would lose 35 to 40 seats in the House if the election were held today, thereby ceding their majority to Democrats he's convinced will pursue impeachment. He argued there's still time to turn that around and is launching a group, Citizens of the American Republic, to pitch the election as a vote to protect Trump from that outcome. \"You can't look at this as a midterm and you can't run it out of the traditional Republican playbook. If you do that, you're going to get smoked,\" said Bannon, arguing that Republicans must redouble efforts against motivated Democrats. The effort is a test of Bannon's sway in the GOP a year after he was fired from his White House post. His relationship with Trump soured after a tell-all book published in January included searing quotes of Bannon portraying Trump as undisciplined and criticizing son Donald Trump Jr. His stock fell further after he stuck by Alabama Republican Roy Moore's Senate campaign even after decades-old sexual misconduct allegations emerged. A reliably Republican Senate seat turned Democratic. As he attempts a comeback, Bannon acknowledged the challenges he faces, including an invigorated Democratic base. Less than three months from Election Day, Democrats need a net gain of 24 seats to retake the House, and the party is increasingly bullish about its chances after strong turnout in a series of special elections. Bannon said Republicans can gain ground if they focus on turning out Trump supporters. \"This is not about persuasion. It's too late to persuade anybody. We're 90 days away from this election. This is all about turnout and what I call base-plus,\" he said. While Bannon makes his move, many Republicans view holding the House as an uphill battle. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bannon said his new venture will focus on rapid response and polling with the goal of framing the election as an \"up or down vote\" on Trump and impeachment. He is also releasing a movie about the president, \"Trump@War,\" geared at Trump supporters. Bannon said he was being backed by private donors, but he did not detail who was funding the effort or how much he had raised. He said his efforts were independent of the Republican National Committee, the White House or a Trump-supporting super PAC. In keeping with his midterm mission, Bannon defended the president on both policy and style, arguing that the president had an economic record to run on and has been making the right pitch on the campaign trail. On trade, Bannon backed the president's aggressive tariffs, which have drawn criticism in agricultural states crucial to Trump's victory. He argued they were a key part of Trump's nationalistic economic strategy. \"People in Iowa, once it's explained to them, will fully support the president in this,\" he said. \"We don't have a choice. We either win the economic war with China or we're going to be a secondary, a tertiary power.\" He said Trump's culture wars, which have included public attacks on women and minorities, don't present a problem, calling it his \"house style\" and saying people should \"separate out the signal from the noise.\" He argued that Trump would benefit from shutting down the government over funding for his border wall, saying it would \"galvanize the populist right,\" though he acknowledged it was a minority view. Bannon also pushed back against the idea that a loss of the House could be a positive development for Trump as it would give him a new foil heading into the 2020 presidential election. He called such notions \"dangerously naive.\" Looking ahead to 2020, Bannon said attorney Michael Avenatti, who is weighing a bid as a Democratic candidate, could be a contender. The combative attorney has been taking on Trump on behalf of a porn actress who claims a sexual encounter with the president, which Trump denies. \"He's a fighter and people are looking for fighters,\" Bannon said of Avenatti, though he believes Trump would defeat any opponent. \"He's going to be a force in the primary for the simple reason that he comes across as what many of the Democrats don't, which is a fighter.\"",

            "article_content": "SEOUL -- It's been more than a decade since the leaders of the two Koreas have held a summit. Could it happen now? South Korean President Moon Jae-in told reporters Wednesday that he remains open to a meeting with North Korea's leader, if it would improve the strained relations between their two countries and help resolve the global standoff over the North's nuclear weapons development. It's not a new position for Moon, who took office in May, but it took on new meaning coming one day after high-level officials from the two Koreas held a rare and apparently successful meeting, agreeing on the North's participation in the upcoming Winter Olympics in the South. A meeting between the two leaders isn't likely in the immediate future. The North's Kim Jong Un hasn't met any foreign leader since he succeeded his father in 2011, and attitudes have hardened since the only two previous Korean summits in 2000 and 2007, when South Korean presidents were pursuing a \"Sunshine Policy\" of trying to win over the North through engagement and aid. White House officials confirmed to CBS News that Moon had spoken on the phone Wednesday with President Trump. The officials did not dispute the South Korean presidency's statement that Mr. Trump has said the U.S. remains open to talks with North Korea, under the right circumstances. CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan notes that Mr. Trump made similar remarks himself on Saturday, even suggesting he would be willing to speak by phone with Kim. Moon is a liberal who favors a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue and whose election ended nine years of hard-line conservative rule. He was chief-of-staff to former President Roh Moo-hyun, who held the last summit with Kim's father in 2007. Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul, said a meeting during Moon's five-year term is possible. \"Kim has never met any foreign leader, so it would be meaningful for him to make his first summit a meeting between Koreans,\" Koh said. During the televised news conference in Seoul, Moon said \"I keep myself open to any meeting including a summit,\" and that he would push for further talks and cooperation after Tuesday's meeting. \"To have a summit, some conditions must be established,\" he said. \"I think a certain level of success must be guaranteed.\" He didn't set any specific conditions. Moon called North Korea's participation in next month's Olympics \"very desirable,\" but said inter-Korean relations cannot be improved without progress on the nuclear issue. He warned that the North would face harsher international sanctions and pressure if it resorts to new provocations, adding that \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the path to peace and our goal.\" Under the deal struck Tuesday at the border village of Panmunjom, North Korea will send officials, athletes, cheerleaders, journalists and others to the Olympics in Pyeongchang, a mountainous county near the border. South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said Wednesday he expects the delegation will include 400 to 500 people. The accord stipulates the two Koreas will actively cooperate in the Olympics to \"enhance the prestige of the Korean people.\" The two sides also agreed to hold military talks, and North Korea said it had recently restored a military hotline with the South, the second reopening of an inter-Korean communication channel in about a week, according to South Korean officials. All major communications had been shut down because of the tensions over the North's nuclear program. The accords, reached at the first meeting between the rival Koreas in about two years, were widely viewed as a positive step following a year of escalating tension over Kim's rapidly advancing nuclear and missile programs. Last year, Kim and President Donald Trump exchanged bellicose rhetoric and crude insults as North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test and three tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles that put the U.S. within its range. Trump contended that his tough stance had helped persuade the North to sit down with the South, and Moon said during Wednesday's news conference that he feels thankful to the U.S. president for helping make the talks happen. Some warn that tensions could quickly flare again as the North still wants to expand its weapons arsenal. They also say Kim may be pushing for better ties with South Korea because North Korea is feeling the pain of U.S.-led international sanctions. The countries have a long history of failing to follow through with rapprochement accords. In 2015, negotiators met for nearly 40 hours before announcing a deal to pull back from a military standoff caused by land mine blasts that maimed two South Korean soldiers. But animosities flared again several months later after the North Korea's fourth nuclear test. John Delury, a China and North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, cautioned that the process is fragile, but said Tuesday's talks are opening up new diplomatic possibilities, in striking contrast to last year. \"It's still very early in this process, and we have to see how much momentum it acquires, but so far this year is definitely getting off to a very different start,\" he said. \"You have to knock on the door to see if it will open.\" Two earlier liberal presidents, Roh and his predecessor Kim Dae-jung, met with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. But the conservative governments that followed them took a tougher line. The presidency of conservative Lee Myung-bak, from 2008 to 2013, was marked by animosity, including North Korean attacks on a warship and a border island that together killed 50 South Koreans in 2010. His successor, Park Geun-hye, indefinitely suspended South Korean participation in a joint industrial park in North Korea's Kaesong city in February 2016, the last remaining major symbol of cooperation between the two.",

Mr. Trump held two rallies for her Monday \u2014 one in Tupelo, Mississippi, and then one 300 miles to the south in Biloxi, Mississippi.\u00a0 Both rallies clocked in shorter than Mr. Trump's rallies in the lead-up to the midterm elections. At each, Mr. Trump mentioned the migrant caravan moving north through Mexico toward the U.S., and pushed for funding for a border wall. In Tupelo, Mr. Trump gave a version of his common refrain before the election that \"Democrats have become the party of caravans and crime.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump did not mention the GE closings at either rally, and despite the massive job losses, he said in Biloxi that his administration had found the \"magic wand\" to bring back manufacturing. \"Under my administration we've created 600,000 brand new manufacturing jobs that people said could never come back to our country. Right? Remember the previous administration \u2013 remember the previous administration said 'oh manufacturing jobs that will never happen.' I kept saying what's he talking about? Manufacturing. We got to make things, right? They said 'manufacturing jobs would never come back. You'd need a magic wand.' Well we found the magic wand. Mississippi voted overwhelmingly for the president in 2016. Hyde-Smith was appointed U.S. senator for the state after former Sen. Thad Cochran was forced to leave his seat due to deteriorating health. Mr. Trump mentioned the importance of the keeping the Senate majority at the Biloxi rally, saying that \"Mississippi must defend our Senate Republican majority.\" In Tupelo, Mr. Trump cast Espy as \"far left.\"\u00a0 \"Cindy's far left opponent. He's far left. Ohh he's out there. How does he fit in with Mississippi, I mean how does he fit in?\" Mr. Trump had a couple pop culture moments at the Tupleo rally. At one point, he said people compared himself to Elvis when he was younger, which he considers a compliment. In discussing his approach to trade \u2013 which he wants to call the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the president said the U.S.M.C.A. sounds like the YMCA. \"Y-M-C-A,\" he said, singing the tune.\u00a0 Mississippi is Trump country \u2014 the state voted for Mr. Trump by 18 points. But Hyde-Smith failed to capture enough votes to fend off Espy, with a third-party candidate garnering 15 points in the Nov. 6 election.\u00a0 Hyde-Smith has found herself in hot political waters, after joking about a \"public hanging.\" She only partly apologized after intense public pressure. But Mr. Trump has defended her, when given the chance.\u00a0 \"Cindy Hyde-Smith is a spectacular woman,\" the president told reporters last week. \"She's a great senator. She came in, she's done a fantastic job in a short period of time. She made a statement which I know that she feels very badly about it, and it was just sort of said in jest, as she said. And she's a tremendous woman. And it's a shame that she has to go through this.\"",

            "article_content": "While the results from last week's midterm election are still trickling in, being counted or recounted, the Democratic primary for the 2020 presidential race is already in full swing, if unofficially. While few candidates have announced, many likely contenders spent the 2018 campaign stumping and fundraising for candidates in the hopes of making their respective marks within the party. With so many Democrats expressing interest in taking on Trump, CBS has compiled a list of potential candidates and where they are staking their claim in what figures to be the most crowded field yet. The record year was 2016, when 17 major candidates vied for the GOP nomination. The first-term senator has seized her perch on the Judiciary Committee as a national platform, most notably during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when she asked, \"Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?\" Additionally, Harris spent much of the 2018 midterm election cycle campaigning for colleagues and building a network of candidates. A former mayor of Newark, Booker is known for his social media savvy and attention-getting performances \u2014 most notably, his \"I am Spartacus\" moment at the Kavanaugh hearings. Booker has already been testing the waters in Iowa, and told reporters there recently that he wants to \"be a voice in this country for love.\" The primary process will test whether this approach matches or clashes with party voters' sentiments about the president. Known as a progressive darling, Warren has built the most extensive political network yet, reaching all 50 states. The senator has also shown, for better or for worse, a knack for going toe-to-toe with President Trump, releasing the results of a DNA test on any Native American ancestry and using Twitter to fire back at the president. Easily re-elected in 2018, Gillibrand has developed a network to engage more women in politics through her Off the Sidelines PAC. She has also show she's not afraid to take on her own party \u2014 leading the charge to oust fellow Democrat Al Franken from the Senate over misconduct allegations and arguing last year that former President Bill Clinton should have resigned over the scandal involving Monica Lewinsky. Klobuchar was overwhelmingly re-elected to a third term in November in a state Donald Trump came close to winning in 2016, and is a frequent guest at various state party gathers, including in early states. She was a prominent figure during the Kavanaugh hearing as one of the few women of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and earned acclaim within the party for her back and forth with the judge. Kavanaugh apologized to Klobuchar after responding harshly to her question about drinking, after she had detailed her father's alcoholism. Klobuchar is known for her \"Minnesota nice\" personality, but cut her chops as a Hennepin County prosecutor and has degrees from Yale and the University of Chicago.\u00a0 Perhaps among the lesser known of this group, Merkley garnered national attention for being among the first politicians to visit a detention center at the southern border. When he was turned away by officials there, he streamed the experience in a Facebook video that went viral, and drew attention to the humanitarian crisis there spurred by the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy. Fresh off winning his Senate re-election bid last week, the Ohio Democrat says that it's possible he'll run for president in 2020. A liberal who can win in Trump country. Brown picked up his third term in a state the president won by eight points \u2014 on the same day voters there chose a Republican for governor. Known for his scratchy voice and disheveled look, Brown has carved out a niche for himself as a working class champion \u2014 and one whose views on trade policy and China are more in line with Trump than most traditional Republicans. The runner-up for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, Sanders has a vast grassroots network that has continued to work through the midterms. While many of Sanders' candidates foundered in the midterms, many of the policies he has championed \u2014 like \"Medicare for All\" and a federal minimum wage \u2014 have become policy mainstays in the party. While candidates usually play coy, Delaney blew past convention and announced his candidacy in July of 2017, just half a year into Trump's first year in office. Delaney, a wealthy former businessman, is still the the least known candidate, though he has made frequent trips to the early states and has endorsed local office candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire. The 37-year-old congressman is a familiar face on cable news, using his perch as a member of the House Intelligence Committee to challenge the president, and he has also become a prominent figures in the congressional investigation into Russian meddling and allegations of collusion. Could losing be winning when it comes to the Democratic presidential primary? The 46-year old El Paso lawmaker came within three points of winning a Senate seat in ruby red Texas, and raised over $38 million in the process. His candidacy inspired a nationwide Democratic obsession and garnered endorsements from the likes of Beyonce. \u00a0 A former Marine Corps officer, the 40-year-old, two-term Moulton set out to create a green wave of military vets running for office in the 2018 cycle. He has also been critical of his party's leadership, calling for fresher faces to lead the party. The West Virginia state senator and veteran of Army tours in Iraq and Afghanistan announced his 2020 on Monday, nearly a week after losing his bid to represent the 3rd Congressional District by a dozen points. Ojeda, who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, garnered national attention over the course of the 2018 cycle running as a Democrat in a state where the president is most popular. \"The President of the United States, Republicans and Democrats, have focused more on infighting, political wars, than they have focused on being there for the working class citizens,\" Ojeda said in a Facebook live post announcing his presidential bid.\u00a0 The attorney for adult film actress Stormy Daniels and a prolific cable news presence has made visits to early states and developed his own super PAC. Avenatti's style has irked fellow Democrats, particularly during the Kavanaugh hearings, but the attorney argues he's best positioned to play and beat Mr. Trump at his own game. The newly retired Starbucks CEO has inserted himself into political discourse, criticizing Mr. Trump's rhetoric. CNBC reports that Schultz is building a public relations team to help with the release of a new book and a possible presidential run. One member of that PR team is Steve Schmidt, who managed John McCain's 2008 presidential bid. Schmidt left the GOP in June and is a frequent critic of the president. The former hedge fund manager has long been involved in Democratic politics, and spent over $120 million on the midterms. He has found his niche in the field by leading the calls for Mr. Trump's impeachment. In an interview with CBSN, Steyer called for \"transformational leadership\" and someone \"who will not try to meet in the middle\" when it comes to a candidate for president. Steyer hasn't made up his mind about running, but said \"I promise I'm thinking of it really hard.\" The businessman and former New York City mayor spent over $110 million on the midterms, and has been an outspoken advocate for gun control. Bloomberg is a businessman who was elected mayor as a Republican and as an independent, and recently joined the Democratic Party. Bloomberg spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2016, and drew attention for saying of Mr. Trump, \"I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.\" The Colorado governor and former businessman is leaving office in January, but is openly talking about his 2020 prospects, telling reporters in New Hampshire recently that he was \"leaning strongly\" towards running. Hickenlooper has been twice elected in a purple state critical to winning the presidency. He signed gun control measures in Colorado that were met with backlash there, but could be appealing among Democratic primary voters. The Montana governor has a proven ability to win in a red state, having been re-elected by four points in 2016 when Trump carried the state by over 20 points. Bullock was elected to lead the National Governors Association, which helps him build a network of office holders and donors. The governor would be seen as a moderate force in a Democratic primary, but has also voiced support for tougher gun laws, including an assault weapons ban. Having served as governor of Virginia and chairman of the DNC, the longtime friend of the Clintons has built a critical fundraising network around the country. McAuliffe campaigned for candidates in the 2018 midterms, including in the first caucus state of Iowa. He touts economic developments and low unemployment in Virginia as a calling card. He pushed for Medicaid expansion in his state, though it met resistance in the GOP legislature, and moved to restore voting rights to felons. The former Massachusetts governor is being forced to defend his current position with the private equity firm Bain Capital, and could raise problems with Democratic primary voters who have shown a resistance to Wall Street. \"I've never taken a job where I've left my conscious at the door and I haven't started now,\" he said on CNN over the summer. Patrick, who was appointed by President Clinton to oversee the civil rights division at the Justice Department, is popular among former Obama officials. But he has also told former Obama adviser David Axelrod that \"I'm not sure there is a place for me\" in the crowded Democratic primary field. The New York governor, and son of Mario Cuomo, soundly won his primary against Cynthia Nixon in September and was easily reelected to a third term in November. Cuomo ruled out a presidential run during a debate with Nixon, pledging to serve a full term if elected. But the governor has proposed legislation like free college tuition for middle and low income families, and that would be appealing to Democratic primary voters. A southern Democrat from a prominent political family, the former mayor of New Orleans could appeal to voters seeing a moderate force in the party to be successful in a general election. Landrieu wrote a book this year titled \"In the Shadow of Statues: A White Southerner Confronts History\" in which he describes his decision to remove four confederate statues in his city, a decision that gained national attention as the then-mayor confronted the difficult issues of race and division. The mayor of Los Angeles has been a frequent traveler to early caucus and primary states, making no secret of his interest in running for president in 2020. Jewish and also of Mexican descent (and the son of former district attorney Gil Garcetti, who prosecuted OJ Simpson), Garcetti sees opportunity in the Democratic Party's diversity, and he considers his management of the country's second largest city to be his calling card. The former mayor of San Antonio and Housing and Urban Development secretary in the Obama administration has been considered a rising star in the party ever since he was tapped to speak at the Democratic National Convention in 2012. He has traveled to early states and recently published a biography and has said he is \"likely\" to run in 2020. The former vice president tops early polling of the 2020 field and has been traveling around the country over the past few months campaigning for Democratic candidates in the midterm. After sitting 2016 out, Biden told CBS This Morning that \u00a0\"I think about whether or not I should run based on very private decisions relating to my family and the loss of my son and what I want to do with the rest of my life...I think people are going to judge it, if I were to run. I think they're gonna judge me on my vitality.\" The former attorney general garnered national controversy for his \"When they go low, we kick 'em\" remark and has been a top opponent for Republican lawmakers. But the Obama alum has also been visiting early states and has made gerrymandering reform a top priority since leaving the Justice Department. Oprah Winfrey went door-to-door campaigning for gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams earlier this month, but has continued to pour cold water over her own political aspirations. Oprah\u00a0piqued interest with a stirring speech at the Golden Globes in January. She's registered as independent but has been one of the most prominent supporters of Democrats for decades.\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political reporter for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Control of the U.S. Senate remains in flux with less than three weeks until Election Day, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Wednesday. Citing nine competitive races across the country \u2013 in Arizona, Nevada, Montana, North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, Tennessee, West Virginia and Florida \u2013 McConnell said, \"I don't think any of them are over one way or the other.\" In recent weeks he has described the ongoing battle for Senate control as \"a knife fight in an alley\" and he said again Wednesday that somewhere amid those nine races \"is a majority for somebody.\" \"We probably have a slight edge just based on the numbers,\" McConnell added, likely in reference to the number of seats Democrats are defending -- 26 -- compared to Republicans, who are defending only nine.\u00a0   The Senate leader spoke during an interview with national cable and network television correspondents and producers, part of an ongoing media tour in the days leading up to the midterm elections. McConnell demurred when asked whether he agreed with President Trump, who told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he should not shoulder the blame if Republicans lose congressional control. \"We haven't had the election yet,\" said McConnell, who rarely publicly parts ways with the president. \"After every election, whoever loses, there is a lot of finger pointing, and whoever wins, a lot of effort to take credit. I'd rather wait to see what happens. I'm hopeful that we can hold on to the majority. I'd rather be at 51 than 49, but we've got a lot of very close races and it's not over yet.\" Republicans currently hold 51 seats, while the Democratic caucus holds 49. National political polling shows Republicans are strongly positioned to hold and perhaps expand their Senate majority. \u00a0 As for what might happen once the elections are over, McConnell said he hopes Congress can avoid another government shutdown over spending levels. Mr. Trump is pushing for full funding of his long-promised border barrier along the U.S.-Mexico span, but McConnell would not commit to full funding. \"The speaker and I are going to try to help the president get funding for the wall for a year,\" he said. \"Shutting down the government I think is something that's widely disliked by virtually every American and I don't think we'll end up doing that.\" More long term, McConnell said he does not think the White House and Congress will tackle long-term reform of programs like Social Security and Medicare until after Mr. Trump leaves office, given that the current White House occupant promised during his 2016 campaign not to revamp those programs. Asked if he thinks he can change the president's mind on the subject, McConnell said, \"I don't think so.\" \"Someday we're going to have to tackle this big problem and when we do, it'll have to be tackled on a bipartisan basis,\" he said. \"Divided government would be the perfect time to do that. President Obama and I had a number of discussions about that during his tenure, because six of the eight years he had we had divided government. For a variety of different reasons, we didn't get the job done,\" he said. Over the course of the 35-minute exchange, McConnell was asked several hypothetical questions about the potential for divided control of Congress \u2013 with Republicans presumably holding the Senate and Democrats retaking control of the House. Repeatedly, he declined to entertain the notion. \"I'm hoping we don't have to deal with a Democratic House,\" he said. \"That would not be a welcome development. And my hope is that we'll have a Republican Senate.\" Bo Erickson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "An investigation by the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) found that White House aide and spokesperson Kellyanne Conway violated the Hatch Act on two separate occasions by \"advocating for and against candidates\" during the Alabama Senate special election campaign in December 2017.  The Hatch Act\u00a0bars federal employees from using their government positions to sway an election in favor of or against a particular candidate in any election. The OSC, lead by Henry Kerner, is a separate institution from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. OSC is an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency that investigates complaints about Hatch Act violations and other prohibited personnel practices (PPPs).   In Conway's case, the OSC found that \"she impermissibly mixed official government business with political views about candidates in the Alabama special election,\" according to a statement addressed to President Trump that Kerner released Tuesday. With the report, the OSC called on Mr. Trump to deliver \"appropriate disciplinary action\" for Conway.  \"Ms. Conway was aware of the Hatch Act's prohibitions when she chose during both interviews to repeatedly identify reasons why voters should support one candidate over another in the Alabama special election,\" the document reads.  The OSC references two interviews Conway gave: one on CNN's \"New Day,\" and the other on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends.\" \"Doug Jones in Alabama, folks, don't be fooled,\" Conway said of the Democratic candidate in the Fox News interview on Nov. 20, speaking from the White House grounds. \"He will be a vote against tax cuts. He is weak on crime. Weak on borders. He is strong on raising your taxes. He is terrible for property owners.\" She again denounced Jones in favor of the Republican candidate Roy Moore during her Dec. 6 CNN interview. \"[T]he only endorsement that's mattered in the Alabama race \u2026 is the president's, because after he came out against Doug Jones -- and none of you seem to want to say those nine letters -- Doug Jones -- that God forbid people find out who he is and who he would be in the Senate, so the president had to go out and do it for you,\" Conway said. White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley responded to the OSC's letter Tuesday. \"Kellyanne Conway did not advocate for or against the election of any particular candidate,\" he said in a statement. \"She simply expressed the President's obvious position that he have people in the House and Senate who support his agenda. In fact, Kellyanne's statements actually show her intention and desire to comply with the Hatch Act -- as she twice declined to respond to the host's specific invitation to encourage Alabamans to vote for the Republican.\" Blair Guild is a politics reporter and video producer for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Facebook (FB) plans to rely on centuries-old technology to try to prevent foreign meddling in U.S. elections: the post office. Baffled in 2016 by Russian agents who bought ads to sway the U.S. presidential campaign, Facebook's global politics and government outreach director, Katie Harbath, told a meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State in Washington on Saturday that the company would send postcards to potential buyers of political ads to confirm they reside in the U.S. The recipient would then have to enter a code in Facebook to continue buying the ad. The method will first apply to ads that name candidates ahead of the midterm elections in November, said Facebook spokesman Andy Stone. The plan was unveiled a day after special counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russians with interfering in the presidential election. Mueller's indictment described how Russian agents stole social security numbers and other information from real Americans and used them to create bank and PayPal accounts in order to buy online ads. Agents also recruited Americans to do things such as hold up signs at rallies organized to create content for Russian-created social media posts. Facebook uncovered some 3,000 Russian-linked ads on Facebook and Instagram bought before and after the November 2016 election that it says may have been seen by as many as 150 million users. But ads were only part of the problem, as the Mueller indictments say that Russian agents also set up fake pages with names such as \"Secured Borders,\" ''Blacktivist\" and \"United Muslims of America\" that had hundreds of thousands of followers. The indictments, announced Friday by the U.S. Department of Justice, pointed to how the Russian nationals waged a campaign of information warfare against the U.S., including relying on social media accounts to pose as people living in the country. The agency also alleges that those indicted began buying ads on Facebook that promoted a post accusing Hillary Clinton of voter fraud.\u00a0 After the indictments, Facebook vowed to do more. \"We know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\" said Joel Kaplan, vice president of global policy at Facebook, in a statement. \"We're making significant investments, including increasing the number of people working on security from 10,000 to 20,000 this year.\" Facebook did not say how the new postcard method of verification would prevent foreign agents from setting up local mailing addresses and hiring people in the U.S. to check them. But Stone said the method was \"one piece of a much larger effort to address foreign electoral influence on our platform.\" Facebook's efforts largely center around verifying people on the platform are who they say they are. To catch duplicitous ad-buyers, for instance, it is now testing out in Canada a system that allows people to see which ads are being bought by a Facebook page \u2014 say, a candidate's \u2014 even if the person checking the ad is not in the group to whom the ad was intended to be shown. Stone said Facebook was also able to detect and remove \"tens of thousands\" of fake Facebook pages in advance of French, German and British elections last year using improved machine learning techniques.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Rep. Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and chairman of the House Oversight Committee, that aired Sunday, July 15, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Greenville, South Carolina and Trey Gowdy, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee that's one of the committees investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Congressman, you just heard President Trump once again refer to the Russia probe as a witch hunt and he specifically referred to the hearing that you chaired this past week with FBI agent Peter Strzok as proof of his claim. Do you agree with the president's assertions and they do seem aimed here at discrediting the Mueller probe? REPRESENTATIVE TREY GOWDY: I don't think it's a witch hunt. I've never thought it was a witch hunt. We now have two series of indictments against Russians; one for the social media the other for the unlawful intrusions. Russia attacked this country in 2016. That's the number one thing we've asked Mueller to look at what did Russia do. The second part which unfortunately is where are the hyperfocus is, is with whom if anyone did they do it. Margaret, no Americans have been indicted with respect to conspiring to impact the 2016 elections. My focus is on the first thing: what did Russia do. And that's not a witch hunt. That's an attack on our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're right no Americans were charged, but 12 Russian military intelligence officers were for attacking the DNC and other Democratic organizations going after Hillary Clinton's e-mails and also attempting to break into state election board. So how should Americans understand this? REP. GOWDY: That this is an attack on all of us. Our elections are just that, Margaret, they are our elections and Republicans and Democrats are free to fight among and with themselves. But, that fight ends at the border. And- and I would ask the president to give some serious consideration. Your first requests of Vladimir Putin needs to be: tell us which airport we can pick up the 25 Russians that tried to interfere with the fundamentals of our democracy. If you really claim you had nothing to do with it that you should be as shocked as we were that your military was being used to impact our election. Tell us where you're going to extradite those folks because an American grand jury indicted them for undermining our democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have now heard over 20 hours of testimony from Peter Strzok who is named by the president there, you also met with Lisa Page, a lawyer at the FBI involved with this Friday, I think you're meeting with her again tomorrow. In your investigations have you seen any evidence of an anti-Trump bias at the FBI? REP. GOWDY: Sure. An anti-Trump bias? Absolutely. You just mentioned two of them, Strzok and- and Page. I mean Strzok- Strzok was- was a bias against Trump before he began investigating him of course on August the 6th he promised to stop his candidacy on the 15th he talked about an insurance policy. I think the most damning piece of evidence, Margaret, with respect to bias is the day Bob Mueller was announced Special Agent Peter Strzok wasn't talking about indictments like you and I just were, he wasn't talking about defending the country like you and I are, he's talking about impeaching the president. That is an unprecedented level of bias. Now, how pervasive it was beyond those two- I think there are four or five other unidentified Bureau and Department agents and employees who also had bias. But there are 13,000 FBI agents and 99.9 percent of them are doing exactly what you would want them to do and exactly the way you would want them to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that's -a point here though that seems to be getting lost or at least when the president is speaking he's conflating these specific individuals the number you put, four or five, with the entire intelligence organization that is the FBI and there is some concern that that is corrosive to our democracy. Do you fear that your hearing is being used in that way? REP. GOWDY: Well, our private hearing was much more constructive than the public hearing. I mean, public hearings are a circus, Margaret, I mean that's why I don't like to do them. I don't do many of them. I mean it's a freak show. I mean the private interviews are much more constructive. But I would also say this -I mean put yourself in President Trump's shoes for just a second. Jim Comey thought that impeachment was too good for you. John Brennan says you should be in the dustbin of history. Those are not insignificant people, one headed the FBI the other headed the CIA when you were under investigation. The lead FBI agent said that you would be destabilizing for the country and promise to stop your candidacy. I mean, Margaret if you were being investigated by people who had that level of bias and animus against you I think you would be concerned as well. What I would tell the president is no American has been indicted for conspiring to hack the DNC but Russia did attack us so focus on the first prong on that motor jurisdiction. Let the second prong play out. But so far the with whom if anyone did they do it we we've got a big zero with respect to Americans. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to play devil's advocate here, there are other Republicans who were questioning the president as a candidate. And- and comments he made and whether that made him fit for office. So, I mean you're not trying to argue that only Trump supporters should be involved with this investigation? REP. GOWDY: No and thank God. Republican candidates for president aren't in charge of counterintelligence investigations. I mean put politicians in one heap. I mean thank God we don't put them in charge of major investigations. Peter Strzok was supposed to be a counterintelligence expert. He was put in charge of the probe, and he's going from talking about stopping him, to he hopes he resigns, to impeachment. Margaret, keep in mind, his main concern when he was trying to deliberate on whether or not to be part of Mueller's probe is that it might not lead to impeachment. I mean if you are a counterintelligence expert this is a chance of a lifetime to fight for your country against Russia and you're concerned that it might not lead to impeachment. I mean no American would want Peter Strzok investigating them if- if he if he had that amount of animus against them. -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you-- REP. GOWDY: --None of us would. MARGARET BRENNAN: --Are you going to sign on to this effort to impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that House Republicans are talking about putting forward this week? REP. GOWDY: No. Impeach him for what? No. MARGARET BRENNAN: Inappropriate? REP. GOWDY: I- I've had my differences with Rod Rosenstein. I-I talk to him quite often privately. Which, again, is a lot more constructive than the public hearings we have. He's a Trump appointee. So is Jeff Sessions. So is Chris Wray. If President Trump is dissatisfied with Rod Rosenstein he can fire him with a tweet. But- but- but to impeach someone. I- no. I would not be- I'm not convinced there is a movement. I read about it in Politico and sometimes their sources are better than mine. But- but I'm not part of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, are you going to investigate who the congressional candidate was who was in contact with the conspirators? This is named in the indictment. REP. GOWDY: I would love to know who that was, so I hope you'll investigate it. I'm going to try to find out who it is. Now this is an unindicted- I mean that's important. Whatever this person did didn't rise to the level of criminality. But I am incredibly disappointed that any member of Congress would reach out to Wikileaks or Julian Assange or Luci- or Gucifer or Lucifer and try to get dirt on on a Democrat. That is very disappointing. I don't know who it is, but I'd love it if you or I one found out who it was. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well when you find out get back to us Congressman. Thank you very much-- TREY GOWDY: You do the same. MARGARET: -- for your time. We'll be back in one minute with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including conversation with the number two in the Senate: John Cornyn. Don't go away.",

            "article_content": "Tuesday is Election Day. Here's how you can follow the results, understand the stakes, and know which races CBS News is looking at. \u00a0 Tuesday is Democrats' last, best chance to stifle President Trump's agenda before he completes his first term. At stake is control of the House and Senate, not to mention numerous statewide races, including a number of crucial governorships. Democrats are likely to win the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2010. Under President Obama, the GOP used the chamber to investigate the White House and block Democratic priorities. Now Democrats are hoping to return the favor by flipping seats in the suburbs and some GOP-dominated rural areas. Should Democrats win one or both chambers of Congress, it will be exceedingly difficult for Mr. Trump and the Republicans to pass major legislative priorities. On the other hand, if Republicans maintain control of the House and Senate, they will have bucked history and delivered a major blow to the Democratic Party. The party in the White House very rarely keeps control of Congress in the first midterm after a presidential election; the last time it happened was 2002, when President George W. Bush was still massively popular in the wake on the 9/11 attacks. It may not be easy for Democrats to take the House majority, since they will have to win a string of districts in Republican territory and get strong turnout, but they head into Tuesday in position to do so \u2014 even if narrowly. CBS News' current estimate is for Democrats to win 225 seats -- just beyond the 218 needed for a majority -- while Republicans win 210.\u00a0 However, there is a margin of error of plus-or-minus 13 seats on each, keeping the possibility open that Republicans retain control. Democrats need to win a net total of 23 seats to retake the House of Representatives. A Democratic House would likely launch numerous investigations into Mr. Trump and his associates, and might even explore impeachment proceedings down the line. A Democratic House would also present a major roadblock to the administration's domestic agenda, likely blocking big-ticket items like Mr. Trump's proposed border wall and any attempts to privatize federal programs. The GOP currently has 51 Senate seats compared to the Democrats' 49. But despite that slim Republican majority, 10 Democratic senators are fighting for reelection in states Mr. Trump won in 2016, meaning the odds are stacked in favor of the GOP. Still, Democrats have a narrow chance of taking the U.S. Senate, which would potentially give them complete control of Congress if they take the House as well. Such a result could bring the government to a standstill \u2013 or it might drag Mr. Trump, an avowed fan of big deals, to the middle if he looks for common ground. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a conservative stalwart, faces off against telegenic Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke in a marquee Texas race. In Florida, Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum is looking to become the Sunshine State's first black governor while current Gov. Rick Scott looks to beat Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. In Georgia, Democrat Stacy Abrams would become the first black woman to be elected governor in U.S. history if she defeats Republican Brian Kemp. Democratic Rep. Kirsten Sinema and Republican Rep. Martha McSally are battling to replace retiring Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. In Missouri, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill is defending her seat against state attorney general Josh Hawley in a race that could decide which party controls the Senate.

            "article_content": "President Trump is in the final stretch of a 44-city blitz for the midterm elections, but the America he's glimpsed from the airport arrivals and his armored limousine is hardly a reflection of the nation as a whole. The president has mostly traveled to counties that are whiter, less educated and have lower incomes than the rest of the United States, according to Census Bureau data.\u00a0 It's a sign that Mr. Trump is seeking to galvanize the same group of voters that helped carry him to victory in 2016.\u00a0 In his rallies, the president often highlights racial divisions, namely raising concerns over people entering the country illegally from across the southern border. Mr. Trump has largely eschewed the big metropolises for smaller cities. He has been to Tampa, Nashville, Cleveland and Houston \u2014 where the arenas could accommodate his crowds. But he's primarily been jet-setting to smaller places such as Elko, Nevada (population 20,078). Or, Mosinee, Wisconsin (population 4,023). Or, Belgrade, Montana (population 7,874). When Mr. Trump stops at Belgrade on Saturday, historical records suggest he will be the second president to visit the Montana town named after Serbia's capital city. In 2009, Barack Obama held a town hall in Belgrade to promote the Affordable Care Act. Since March, Mr. Trump has crisscrossed the country like a salesman with a set territory. The majority of his trips have been to just nine states. They are Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Indiana, West Virginia and Nevada. In the final days before the midterm election, Mr. Trump is rallying in Montana, Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, and two stops each in Indiana, Missouri and Florida. Mr. Trump won almost all of those states in 2016, but not Nevada. And this year, seven of them feature a major Senate race with a Democratic incumbent. The former casino magnate has visited one city twice for the midterms: Las Vegas. Here is a portrait of the America that the president is seeing: Mr. Trump has journeyed to counties where it's slightly more of a struggle to reach -- and stay -- in the middle class. Out of his scheduled rallies, 74 percent are in counties with median incomes that fall below the national level.\u00a0 But he's brought tidings of a 49-year low unemployment rate and accelerated economic growth to places that mostly lag the median U.S. household income of $55,032. In September, Mr. Trump went to Wheeling, West Virginia. The typical household income in the county surrounding Wheeling is $41,986, or about $13,000 below the national level. The metro area has lost 818 jobs in the 12 months that ended in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And for West Virginia, coal mine jobs have declined this year after a hiring bump in 2017. \"Your state is booming like never before,\" Mr. Trump told the crowd in Wheeling. \"And our great coal miners are back to work.\" Mr. Trump has visited a few affluent counties. He stopped by Rochester, Minnesota, where incomes are high because of the presence of the world-renowned Mayo Clinic. And during a special congressional election in August, the president campaigned in Delaware County, Ohio, where the median household income of $94,234 is just shy of being double the national average. Just 18.1 percent of the adults in Elko County, Nevada hold a college degree. That's compared to 30.3 percent nationwide. Of the 43 places Trump is visiting, 28 have a below-average share of college graduates. Elko's economy is unique because it relies on mining gold, instead of the office and health care jobs that often require a college diploma. The county has five active gold mines, according to the Nevada Commission on Mineral Resources. This makes it something of an outlier in country where mining metal ore accounts for 0.03 percent of all jobs. Mr. Trump went to Elko in part to help push for the re-election of Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who is in a tight race against Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen. Heller flattered the president \u2014 and provided the lone reference to the local economy \u2014 by telling him, \"I think everything you touch turns to gold.\" When Mr. Trump has gone to more educated counties, it's often because they have a major college campus and venues where people can gather. Missoula is home to the University of Montana and 41.8 percent of its adults are college graduates. The University of Missouri is in Columbia, where 46.8 percent of adults hold college degrees. Other than his rallies at big cities, Mr. Trump has generally been in communities that are overwhelmingly white. The U.S. population is 73.3 percent white, but almost three-fourths of the places where the president has stumped for midterms are above that average. In the county surrounding Council Bluffs, Iowa, 88.7 percent of the population is non-Hispanic whites. Mr. Trump told the crowd at his rally that Democrats would allow Central American gangs such as MS-13 to immigrate freely into the United States, a claim disputed by Democratic lawmakers. \"They want to turn America, these Democrats \u2014 and that's what they want \u2014 into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and the MS-13 killers,\" Mr. Trump said. In the area around Council Bluffs, 6.1 percent of the population is of Mexican descent. About 1 percent are from other Hispanic nations. By comparison, 17.3 percent of the U.S. population is Hispanic. The biggest outlier in Mr. Trump's schedule may be his rally Sunday in Macon, Georgia. Its county is 53.9 percent black, making it the lone place being visited by the president where minorities make up the majority of the population. Mr. Trump is going there to promote the gubernatorial candidacy of Republican Brian Kemp. He is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is trying to become the first black female governor in U.S. history.",

            "article_content": "Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill's campaign manager on Wednesday called for her Republican rival Josh Hawley to launch an investigation of footage of her campaign taken by a conservative group known for \"sting\" videos of liberal organizations. \"We have reason to believe that fraud has been committed against our campaign,\" McCaskill campaign manager David Kirby said, later adding that \"there's no question that the videos were captured under false pretenses and misrepresentations, which under Missouri law is fraud.\" But McCaskill's campaign backed off her suggestion Tuesday that Hawley, the attorney general challenging McCaskill in a tight Senate race, may have been behind the sting. \"It is startling that Josh Hawley would be part of fraudulently embedding somebody in my campaign,\" McCaskill told KOLR-10 in Springfield, Missouri on Tuesday. Hawley fired back Wednesday, calling that assertion \"absurd.\" When pressed by reporters Wednesday, Kirby said Hawley is \"perpetrating this fraud by promoting it and encouraging it.\" In a fundraising pitch emailed to supporters, Hawley said \"we cannot allow Senator McCaskill to stay in office after this.\" \"Senator, accusing people of crimes is a serious thing,\" Hawley tweeted. \"If you have evidence of a crime, please come forward with it immediately. Otherwise, please stop politicizing the legal process for your re-election.\" Project Veritas, a conservative group that produces \"sting\" videos intended to embarrass liberal organizations and media outfits, took the videos. An Associated Press request for comment from the organization was not immediately returned Wednesday. Videos show an unnamed man pressing McCaskill and staffers about the candidate's position on bump stock bans, Planned Parenthood campaign donations, impeaching President Donald Trump, a wall on the southern border and other issues. The issues are particularly relevant in a state that's trended Republican in recent elections. Trump won Missouri by nearly 19 percentage points in 2016. \"The truth about her partisanship and party-line liberalism is revealed more every day,\" Hawley said in a statement. McCaskill told KOLR-10 that she's been \"very upfront about all my positions.\" She said she remembers the videographer tried to get her \"to say something different than what my positions are.\" \"And I said: 'No, you've just got to tell the people on the doors it is what it is,'\" McCaskill said. Kirby did not directly answer a reporter's question on whether the staffers quoted in the videos will face discipline, saying he's \"not going to comment on what a 25-year-old kid says behind closed doors when they're not authorized to talk for the campaign.\" Polls show the race between McCaskill and Hawley is neck-and-neck with less than three weeks to go to the election. The two will debate on Thursday night.",

Her posts included pictures from Riggleman's Instagram account showing nude drawings of Bigfoot with his - assuming that the made-up creature is male - genitalia covered with a black rectangle. \"These images are very disturbing, I think everyone should just look at them to see who this candidate is,\" Cockburn said in an interview. But Riggleman said allegations that he's into Sasquatch's sex life are big hairy lies from a failing candidate. \"When people are desperate they do desperate things,\" he said. From my opponent Denver Riggleman\u2019s Bigfoot erotica collection. pic.twitter.com/ELe0TWJh21 Riggleman, an Air Force veteran, said he and his military friends have been interested in people who believe Bigfoot is real for years. He's listed as a co-author of a short online book detailing a Bigfoot hunt in 2006. The drawings on his Instagram account are jokes, he said. One is from a birthday card from a friend, the other is a mock cover art for a satirical book he's writing called \"The Mating Habits of Bigfoot and Why Women Want Him.\" Riggleman said he's found Cockburn's attacks \"hilarious\" and warned that she was in danger of losing support of pro-Bigfoot potential constituents. \"She needs to learn her voters better,\" Riggleman said, in jest. On Monday, Riggleman said in an interview on \"Kibbe on Liberty\" show on the conservative-leaning CRTV that among the reasons he wants to be in Congress is to defend \"the freedom to believe in any type of Bigfoot you want.\" Jokes aside, the bizarre back-and-forth over Bigfoot underscores the high stakes in a key race. Cockburn and Riggleman are competing to represent Virginia's 5th Congressional District, which stretches from northern Virginia to the North Carolina border. Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Garrett announced earlier this year that he will not seek re-election to focus on a recovery from alcoholism. The District is one of four currently GOP-held seats in Virginia that Democrats are bullish on their chances of flipping in this year's election. That would go a long way in helping the party take control of the House. Nationwide, Democrats need to flip 24 seats to take a majority. Republicans have been targeting Cockburn, a former investigative reporter and political newcomer, for months. Because of a 1991 book she wrote criticizing the U.S.'s relationship with Israel, opponents have called her anti-Semitic. She denies that claim.",

            "article_content": "Texas will hold it's Republican and Democratic primaries for the 2018 elections Tuesday, March 6. And they're more exiting than you might think.  Yes and no. While it's true that Texas is dominated by the GOP and has voted for the Republican presidential nominee since 1980, Democrats hope that the state's rising Hispanic population will eventually put it in play. It's already a \"minority-majority\" state, meaning that non-Hispanic whites are less than 50 percent of the population. And since demographic changes helped turn reliably Republican California into one of the most liberal states in the nation, Democrats sometimes think it's just a matter of time before Republicans' grip on the state begins to weaken. Every few years, national Democrats also tend to find themselves falling in love with some charismatic Texan politician. In the 1990s, it was Ann Richards, the witty one-term governor who famously mocked then-President George H.W. Bush at the 1988 Democratic convention. (\"He was born with a silver foot in his mouth,\" she said at one point.) Richards wound up losing her 1994 re-election bid to George W. Bush, but became something of a liberal legend regardless.  In more recent years, national Democrats have swooned over Wendy Davis, the party's unsuccessful 2014 nominee, and Julian Castro, who was Mayor of San Antonio before becoming President Obama's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. And in 2018, Democrats have a couple of youthful politicians they might soon fall in love with.  One is Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who's giving up his House seat to challenge Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in November. Defeating Cruz will be no easy thing in Texas, but there's a chance O'Rourke, who's done well at fundraising and hit the ground running, could pull it off. O'Rourke has attracted quite a bit of media attention and is expected to easily win the Democratic Senate primary on Tuesday. And then there's Laura Moser, a progressive activist who's apparently been raking in money lately. She's running for Congress in Texas 7th District, which is currently represented by nine-term Republican Rep. John Culberson but voted for Hillary Clinton over President Trump in 2016. She's the kind of liberal maverick Texan that national Democrats tend to fall hard for. There's just one problem ... The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) really does not like her. In fact, they dislike her so much that last week they made public their opposition research on her, which is a highly unusual move. In follow-up comments to Vox, a liberal news website, a DCCC spokesperson even went so far as to call Moser \"a truly disqualified general election candidate that would eliminate our ability to flip a district blue.\"  Again, it's highly unusual for a Democratic Party organ to try and nuke a Democratic candidate from orbit like this. But it's not totally clear why DCCC is so keen on openly blasting Moser, particularly given the highly-foreseeable backlash it has already provoked.\u00a0 Moser has committed a few sins in the eyes of the DCCC, the most serious of which is probably her disparagement of Paris, Texas in a 2014 article for Washingtonian.  \"On my pathetic writer's salary, I could live large in Paris, Texas, where my grandparents' plantation-style house recently sold for $129,000,\" Moser wrote in the article, which humorously argues what Washington, D.C.-dwellers should stop complaining about their high cost of living. \"Oh, but wait -- my income would be a fraction of what it is here and I'd have very few opportunities to increase it. (Plus I'd sooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia, but that's a story for another day.)\" Well, it's probably less than ideal, sure. But Texas' 7th Congressional District is centered around Houston, which is hundreds of miles south of Paris. Moser herself has noted this, saying nobody in the district \"wants to live on the Oklahoma border, either.\"  That may be true, but either way, the national Democratic Party seems to have its heart set on nominating one of Moser's rivals, such as Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a local attorney who's been endorsed by EMILY's List.  On Tuesday, they might get their wish. Or their scorched-earth tactics against Moser could backfire, leaving them stuck with her. Either way, Texas 7th Congressional District easily reelected Culberson in 2016 even as it went for Clinton, and is considered a strongly conservative district, so Democrats will have their work cut out for them no matter who gets the nod.  Nope! There's also a primary for Texas Land Commissioner, a powerful statewide office whose existence alone is just one of those strange Lone Star quirks.  Well, it is, and here's why: George P. Bush, son of Jeb Bush and scion of the GOP's foremost political dynasty, currently has the job. Long touted as a rising star in Republican politics, Bush was elected to the position in 2014 after the incumbent, Jerry Patterson, left it to run for lieutenant governor. Now Patterson wants his old job back, and is challenging Bush in the GOP primary -- in part, he says, because Bush has done wrong by the Alamo.  Yes, the Alamo --\u00a0the one where Davy Crockett died. It's a building and a symbol of tremendous importance to Texans. The General Land Office (GLO), which is the agency run by the Land Commissioner, had a plan to fix and revamp the site, which had seen better days by the time Bush took over. In 2014, singer Phil Collins, of \"Genesis\" fame, donated his extensive collection of Alamo memorabilia to Texas under the condition that it would build a suitable shrine for it. So Bush's GLO unveiled a plan in 2017 for a new Alamo monument and museum. But unfortunately for Bush, the design, which updated and in some ways modernized the site, didn't go over so well with a lot of Texans. As luck would have it, next week's primary will be held on the 182nd anniversary of the Battle of the Alamo, so the current scuffle over the site is getting quite a bit of attention. But Patterson also objects to Bush's management of the agency, particularly when it came to the GLO's slow response to last year's Hurricane Harvey. Bush also has the sizable baggage he's inherited from his family, who aren't exactly beloved by grassroots conservatives anymore. However, President Trump, who is quite popular among grassroots conservatives, threw his support behind Bush on Tuesday: Texas LC George P. Bush backed me when it wasn\u2019t the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now. Also, AC Sid Miller has been with me from the beginning, he is \u201cTrump\u2019s Man in Texas.\u201d Also support Comptroller Glenn Hegar, and Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick. Patterson isn't the only person running against Bush; there are also a couple of marginal candidates who have focused somewhat on the Alamo issue. Should Bush get less than 50 percent of the vote on Tuesday, he'll be forced into a runoff, presumably with Patterson, which could upend both his career and one of the most formidable dynasties in American politics.  Kind of! A number of Democrats, including Iraq vet Gina Ortiz Jones, are running for their party's nomination for Texas 23rd Congressional District, which is represented by the high-profile and possibly vulnerable Rep. Will Hurd. In the 32nd Congressional District, Democrats vying for a shot at unseating Rep. Pete Sessions include NFL player turned lawyer Colin Allred.  As for the Republican primaries, there are currently 18 GOP candidates to succeed retiring Rep. Lamar Smith in the 21st Congressional District. They include Chip Roy, who used to work for Ted Cruz, and Jenifer Sarver, a former Bush administration official who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.  There are also a bunch of other races happening, so stay tuned to CBSN for updates.",

            "article_content": "Two states voted Tuesday to add anti-abortion language to their constitutions in what some opponents say is preparation for a potential overturn of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court. Voters in Alabama and West Virginia approved state ballot measures that addressed the question of abortion and sought to ban public Medicaid funding of the procedure. Both measures stated their state's constitution did not protect a woman's right to an abortion and their state would not provide funding for the procedure, except in the case of rape, incest and medical emergency, as is required by federal law. \"It basically paves the way to ban abortion in all instances,\" Shante Wolfe-Sisson, the campaign manager for Alabama for Healthy Families, a group that opposed the initiative, said Wednesday in an interview with CBS News. \"In practice, it will sit in the Alabama constitution as a standing law so in the event that Roe v. Wade is overturned, it will automatically become law.\" In Alabama, voters agreed to amend the state constitution to include that its policy was to protect \"the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life\" and its official stance on abortion was to \"ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child in all manners and measures lawful and appropriate.\" Wolfe-Sisson says these changes would effectively outlaw pregnancy-ending procedures in the event Roe v. Wade gets overturned. Alabama State Rep. Mike Fridy, who sponsored the amendment, did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment. In 1973, the Supreme Court ruling on Roe v. Wade prohibited states from banning abortion prior to fetus viability, securing a woman's right to access the procedure throughout the U.S. In recent years, a number of states have enacted measures such as waiting periods and restrictions on clinics that effectively reduce access to abortion without explicitly outlawing it. However, with a Republican White House and increasingly conservative Supreme Court, some believe that the days of Roe v. Wade may be numbered. During a 2016 presidential debate, then-candidate Donald Trump said he foresaw the ruling being overturned if he were elected because he planned to appoint pro-life judges. He stressed the issue again in a speech before the 2018 midterm elections. So far, the Supreme Court has not agreed to hear a direct challenge to Roe. But if it eventually does so, and if a majority of the justices vote to overturn that precedent, it would be up to individual states to determine whether to restrict or outlaw abortion within its borders. Measures like the ones seen in Alabama and West Virginia are essentially preemptive, said Wolfe-Sisson; in the event that Roe v. Wade is dismantled, abortion will automatically become illegal in Alabama. West Virginians voted for language that said the state constitution does not \"secure or protect\" a woman's right to abortion. The state ballot measure also outlawed the use of Medicaid dollars to pay for abortion except in the case of rape, incest and life endangerment, said Patricia Puertas Rucker, a Republican state senator in West Virginia and lead sponsor of the amendment. \"I believe that that's something that people who have conscious objection shouldn't have to pay for,\" Rucker told CBS News. Medicaid is jointly funded by states and the federal government. Federal law doesn't allow states to bar Medicaid funding for abortions in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. In a written statement, Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, called the latest state efforts an \"unprecedented effort to insert politics into health care.\" West Virginia currently has laws on the books criminalizing abortion, attaching a penalty of three to 10 years of jail time for either performing or receiving the procedure. However, the laws are not in effect because both federal and state courts have found the state code to be unconstitutional. Meanwhile in Oregon, voters on Tuesday went the other direction, rejecting a proposal that would have cut state insurance funding for low-income women seeking abortions.",

            "article_content": "Have you received a strange phone call or text message from an unknown phone number about a political candidate from an unknown phone number? Is your snail mail overflowing with weirdly accurate political fliers? Do chipper canvassers pound on your door and recite scripts that seem tailor-made for you? In the race to secure victory in an election former President Barack Obama called the \"most important of our lifetime,\" both political parties are using \"big data\" to micro-target voters. Information is so precise that many tools allow campaign managers to target individual voters with powerful and highly customized messages. Before the internet, information used by political parties to target voters was generally limited to a voter's home address, voting history, party affiliation, and a few other simple data points. In the past decade, the amount of detailed information about voters has grown exponentially. Firms like L2 Political combine traditional voter information records with modern data files used by the most sophisticated internet marketing firms. \"[Our] data comes from a variety of sources, including states, and counties and municipalities that provide the raw voter data,\" said L2 Political vice president Paul Westcott. \"Once that data is brought in it is scrubbed against the national change of address database, the Social Security death index, and commercial files among scores of other checks. The commercial data comes from a variety of sources, including Experian.\" Voter data is then organized by computer algorithms, allowing campaigns to quickly sift and sort through the issues voters are most passionate about. L2 overlays the information on a map of the United States. Campaigns can zoom out to see the entire country, or zoom way in to get a clear view of states and voting districts. Campaigns can also export the information to common file formats like Microsoft Excel for further analysis by staffers. The interest graph information available in the L2 tool is extensive and allows campaigns to cross-reference demographic information with voter affinity related to hot-button issues like gun control, abortion, the border wall and marijuana legalization. That allows campaigns to craft and target direct mail, robocalls, canvassing routes and social media marketing. \"[After the 2016 campaign] people said they relied on analytics. They relied on these predictive models and at least that's what was being fed out publicly. Really at the end of the day, their models looked good. Their models were actually put together in a really solid way and the team there was among the best in the country,\" said Westcott. In 2018, campaigns are using L2 and predictive analytics powered by big data to model outcome scenarios based on early voting data. Westcott said massive datasets can help campaigns micro-target small but influential groups of voters. \"[Precision data] is the core of what we're reaching out to when we're trying to get our 600 person sample or 1,000 person sample. So the core data matters. The underlying data matters,\" Westcott said. Watch special election coverage live on CBSN on\u00a0fuboTV.

In Chattanooga, Tennessee, Mr. Trump warned again that caravans of immigrants are on their way to flood across the southern border. \"That's an invasion. I don't care what they say,\" he said to cheers. He received similar applause when promoting the economy, unemployment numbers and judicial appointments. When Blackburn took the stage briefly, she told supporters, \"If you want to vote no to Hillary Clinton and her cronies one more time, stand with me.\" The crowd responded with the chant, \"Lock her up!\"\u00a0 Earlier, he held a rally in Georgia Sunday afternoon to stump for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, the Georgia secretary of state whose race is one of the most closely watched of the midterm election cycle. Stacey Abrams, Kemp's Democratic opponent, would be the first African-American woman elected governor in the U.S. The race has featured repeated allegations of voter suppression by Kemp's office, which oversees state elections. The president focused his remarks largely on his own record, and criticized Abrams as \"extreme far-left.\" Kemp, he said, is a \"great leader.\" He pressed voters to focus on his support for Kemp, not Abrams' recent high-profile support from Oprah Winfrey. Earlier, Kemp's office said it had launched an investigation into the Georgia Democratic Party over \"a failed attempt to hack the state's voter registration system.\" The head of the state Democratic Party categorically denied the accusation, saying the \"scurrilous claims\" are \"100 percent false.\" The president did not mention the issue at his Georgia rally. Before leaving the White House for the Georgia rally, Mr. Trump said he had no knowledge of the hacking accusations. He said he thought Kemp will be a \"fantastic governor of Georgia.\"",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia that aired Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: We turn now to Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. Today he's in Wytheville, Virginia getting ready to go canvass for Democrats in Virginia including his colleague Tim Kaine. Good morning Senator. You're going to be knocking on doors \u2014 SEN. MARK WARNER: Good morning, John. JOHN DICKERSON: \u2014 what is your pitch? SEN. WARNER: My pitch is this election people need to get out and vote. If they are concerned about what's going on in Washington if they're concerned about a president that doesn't act very presidential when we see moments of crisis over the last few weeks they need to have their votes counted. And frankly even folks who may agree that the economy is going pretty good I think many, many people realize we need a check on this president and we've seen evidence of that in the last three weeks, when this president was not able to bring the country together after the shootings or the bombing attempts.\u00a0 We saw it when the president, you know, kind of randomly said that he could override the Constitution with a stroke of a pen. People know that we have rule of law in this country. And then in the last couple of days where he said that he's going to take fifteen thousand of our military troops, take them out of Iraq and Afghanistan, no plan, move them to the border and then allow those troops to fire on kids who might be throwing stones. JOHN DICKERSON: But \u2014 SEN. WARNER: That's pretty remarkable, I think, and this president \u2014 just one last point, John. I don't think he understands that words matter. In the last 48 hours in Nigeria, troops shot on students throwing rocks and they turned to President Trump's words as a vindication. JOHN DICKERSON: Well let me come back here at home, the jobs report on Friday \u2014 SEN. WARNER: Sure. JOHN DICKERSON: \u2014 was even better than forecasters expected. Employers added 250,000 jobs. Unemployment rate is 3.7. Wages grew 3.1 percent. They haven't been doing that. If we focus on the James Carville maxim, \"it's the economy, stupid,\" you named a couple, a lot of things but the economy is strong. Why should people want to change course, accepting all the things you said, why would they want to change course with the economy humming like this? SEN. WARNER: Because I think one thing people realize is that we're in a sense riding a sugar high from a two trillion dollar tax cut that was unpaid for. Now the economy is doing pretty well right now I grant that. I think the hangover is going to be pretty bad as we go into next year but we can debate that later. What I think people are concerned about is, they're concerned about this president that frankly, even if you agreed that the economy is going well, that we need to have some level of check on him. The founders set up a system of checks and balance. We got a president in Donald Trump that is totally unchecked at this point. And rule of law and frankly America's standing in the world is being undermined. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to ask you about election security, but quickly on the Intelligence Committee report, your own report. Do you think that's going to come out before the end of the year? SEN. WARNER: That's my hope. We've still got a number of individuals that we have to see. Many of the ones who frankly pled already out with Mueller, we need to see some of these are principles. But I want this to be done because at the end of the day, the American public needs to know, not only what happened in 2016 in terms of Russian interference, but how we're better prepared to make sure it never happens again. JOHN DICKERSON: On this election security question, how secure will the elections be on Tuesday? SEN. WARNER: Well, John, I think we've made great progress particularly at the individual polling stations and in the tabulation of votes. So I think people should go out and vote with confidence. I am concerned that this White House, though, has frankly held back. We've got a broadly based bipartisan election security bill that I think would have gotten 90 votes in the Senate, that would have made sure that every polling station had a paper ballot to audit after the fact if there was ever any kind of intervention. And, unfortunately, the White House stopped that legislation. JOHN DICKERSON: Are you expecting any kind of an attack on Tuesday, what would that even look like, and is the U.S. in a position to respond? SEN. WARNER: I think we are much better. DHS has been doing a very good job in terms of working with individual election registrars. The fact that we have a federal, state, and local circumstance and election means that these are lots of different lines of control. But there is a good cooperative relationship. I think it would have been better if, in the aftermath of 2016, this White House, after that kind of attack, would have actually appointed someone in charge of election security. Unfortunate, Mr. Trump has not done that. Matter of fact he even eliminated the position of cybersecurity at the White House, which I think is a totally wrong move because where we're potentially vulnerable is the ability of Russia or some other foreign actor to either break into some of the voter files at the, at the kind of, at the national level or at the vendor level. And then also what I'm more concerned about is a flood of fake accounts or fake manipulation through social media, where again we've made some progress. But the companies have not moved as far as they need to move. JOHN DICKERSON: Finally, Senator, quickly you received a briefing this week on the murder of journalist or columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Following that, you said there was enough evidence for Congress to act, even if the president doesn't. What kind of action are you expecting Congress to take? SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, John, I've not received that full briefing. The whole gang of eight will, but I believe that it is, that the evidence that the Turks have pointed out, that Khashoggi was brutally murdered in the Saudi consulate and frankly, John, I don't think under President Reagan, under President Bush, or Obama, or Clinton, that any so-called ally would have taken that kind of action because they know America at that point stood for a free press and human rights. Again, the president's words matter, and I think that you're seeing our so-called allies take pretty unusual actions. I think Congress will act, whether it's cut back on arms sales, whether it's looking in terms of some of our nuclear accords, I do think there is an opportunity here and I commend Secretary Pompeo and Mattis for trying to urge the Saudi Arabians to end this brutal war in Yemen. And if there is an opportunity in this moment to get that done that would be a step forward. JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Senator Warner, we thank you so much for being with us. SEN. WARNER: Thank you, John.",

            "article_content": "In President Trump's third rally this week, he criticized the media for its coverage of the arrest of\u00a0Cesar Sayoc, who is suspected of sending at least 13 explosive devices sent by mail to prominent Democratic figures. Mr. Trump claimed the media tried to tie Sayoc to his followers.\u00a0 \"The media has tried to attack the incredible supporters of our movement,\" he said, segueing to discussing his administration's accomplishments. \"We want honest coverage from the media. That's all we want.\" He also repeated his claim that he was a \"nationalist,\" not a \"globalist,\" but he wants \"to help the globe.\" Mr. Trump began the rally by addressing Sayoc's arrest, applauding the FBI, the Secret Service, and state and local law enforcement. \"We love our police, and we love our law enforcement,\" he said. \"Political violence must never, ever be allowed in America and I will do everything in my power to stop it,\" Mr. Trump said, calling for an \"end to the politics of personal destruction.\" He added that \"the media has a major role to play, whether they want to or not.\" The crowd then chanted \"CNN sucks,\" while Mr. Trump looked on. Mr. Trump falsely said that when a supporter of Bernie Sanders shot at several Republican congressmen last year, Republicans did not blame Sanders, as \"it would have been the wrong thing to do.\" In fact, Republican figures such as Newt Gingrich and Rep. Steve King pointed to the rise of violence on the left as a cause for the shooting.\u00a0 \u00a0 Mr. Trump is in Charlotte, the site of the 2020 Republican convention, to rally for vulnerable Republican candidates in the purple state, Rep. Ted Budd and GOP candidate Mark Harris. The CBS News Battleground Tracker rates Budd's district and \"lean Republican.\" Harris, an evangelical pastor, is\u00a0facing a tighter race\u00a0against Democrat Dan McCready. That race is rated \"toss up\" by the CBS News Battleground Tracker. At the rally, Mr. Trump made some references to North Carolina, congratulating the state for its recovery from Hurricane Michael earlier this year. He also mentioned the death of a state trooper whose family was attending the rally. At one point he brought Budd and Harris to the stage, saying that they were the \"real reason\" the rally was occurring. As with many of his recent rallies, Mr. Trump emphasized the need for Republicans to turn out and vote in the midterm elections, raising the specter of \"Cryin' Chuck Schumer\" as Senate Majority Leader and Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House. At one point he also began to criticize Rep. Maxine Waters, but he said that he was \"going to be nice tonight.\" Mr. Trump hit familiar beats in this speech, falsely saying that Democrats wanted to allow \"caravan after caravan\" of migrants into the country, alluding to a caravan currently en route to the United States from South America, which the U.S. is seeking to block. He repeatedly teased that an announcement related to the border wall would come next week. He also incorrectly said that the majority of Democratic congressional candidates supported Medicare for All, and that this plan would \"obliterate\" existing Medicare. Mr. Trump used a version of a catchphrase he has unveiled in previous rallies over the past month: \"This will be the election of the Kavanaughs, and the caravan, and law and order and the tax cuts. And you know what, frankly, this will be the election of common sense.\" He also said that his views weren't conservative or liberal, but \"common sense.\" Mr. Trump's predecessor, former President Obama, also rallied on Friday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Detroit, Michigan, following a similar pattern of criticizing the other party and calling on Democrats to vote. Mr. Trump did not directly address Sayoc, a 56-year-old man from South Florida with connections to New York, who has a criminal history in Broward County, Florida. He also appeared to be a supporter of Mr. Trump. CBS News has also acquired a video of Sayoc at a Trump rally, although it is unclear when the video was recorded. His vehicle appears to have been covered by pro-Trump stickers. Sayoc will likely be prosecuted by the Southern District of New York. Speaking to the Young Black Leadership Summit after Sayoc's arrest, Mr. Trump congratulated law enforcement for collaring him. He said the suspect would be prosecuted \"to the fullest extent of the law.\" He said that the \"terrorizing acts\" were \"despicable and have no place in our country.\" \"We must never allow political violence to take root in America,\" Mr. Trump said. He did not refer to the suspect or the people targeted by name. The president, speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn, said he doesn't share blame in the incident, despite Sayoc's apparent support for him.\u00a0 \"No not at all,\" the president said. \"I mean, not at all. No. There's no blame there's no anything. If you look at what happened to Steve Scalise, that was from a supporter of a different party. If you look at what happened on numerous of these incidents they were supporters of others, no. I'm just really proud of law enforcement, I think they did an incredible job.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

And if they don't, he warned, Democrats will push their agenda of open borders and higher taxes.\u00a0 \"They're trying to take what we did in '16. ... It was the greatest election victory in the history of our country,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that Democrats want to \"burn\" down everything Republicans have built.\u00a0 The president mentioned the Democratic candidate for Senate, former Gov. Phil Bredesen, long before he mentioned the Republican candidate, Rep. Marsha Blackburn. The two are locked in a contentious battle for the Senate seat. Bredesen is tremendously popular in the thoroughly red state, a concern for Republicans there. Bredesen has made some breaks with his party, and has said he wouldn't support Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\u00a0 Mr. Trump claimed Bredesen wants to take away Second Amendment rights. When he finally introduced Blackburn, the president called her a \"true fighter.\"\u00a0 As he often does at such rallies, Mr. Trump reminisced about his election night win in 2016, nearly two years ago, recalling it as one of the best nights.\u00a0 The rally comes as the president, at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has directed the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to add to Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh's background file. At a press conference in the White House Rose Garden Monday, Mr. Trump said he wants a \"comprehensive\" investigation, and the FBI should interview \"anybody,\" within reason. On Monday night, Mr. Trump bemoaned how the Democrats are treating Kavanaugh, lamenting that they're \"trying to destroy a very fine person.\"\u00a0 \"Let's see how it all works out, but I'll tell you what: they're trying to destroy a very fine person. We cannot let that happen,\" Mr. Trump told supporters at his rally.\u00a0 Earlier in the day, the president also announced a new trade deal reached in the 11th hour with Canada and Mexico \u2014 the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, or USMCA. It would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the president has decried as one of the worst trade deals ever, and vowed to renegotiate.\u00a0 Mr. Trump mentioned the new deal in passing Monday night \u2014 but did not elaborate much on keeping his campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA.\u00a0 The president's Tennessee rally is one of a string of pre-midterm rallies. He was in West Virginia Saturday night, and has rallies in Mississippi Tuesday and in Minnesota Thursday.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "President Trump called his embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a \"fantastic man\" from \"central casting,\" and exhorted supporters at a Springfield, Missouri, rally \"to fight for him, not worry about the other side.\" He added, \"Women are for him more than anyone would understand.\" While the president was making his case for Kavanaugh at the Friday rally for Senate GOP candidate Josh Hawley, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee were embroiled in negotiations with lawyers for the woman who alleges Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when both of them were teenagers, Christine Blasey Ford. Lawmakers and Ford's lawyers are trying to reach an agreement on testimony -- likely next week -- from her and Kavanaugh about the incident. The president also took the opportunity during the rally to bash the Justice Department and FBI, saying most people there are good, but there are some \"real bad ones.\" Although many of the \"bad ones\" are gone, he continued, there is a \"lingering stench, and we are going to get rid of that too.\" He offered nothing more specific, but he made the comments after the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had in 2017 suggested recording Mr. Trump to show the turmoil inside the White House and talked about recruiting some in the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare Mr. Trump unfit for office.\u00a0 Soon after the story published, Rosenstein strongly denied the story calling it \"inaccurate and factually incorrect\" in a statement, and he added later that he had \"never pursued or authorized recording the president and any suggestion that I have ever advocated for the removal of the president is absolutely false.\" The Missouri rally was Mr. Trump's second in two days, after an appearance in Las Vegas for Dean Heller on Thursday.\u00a0 Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri is considered to be one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election, as she represents a state which voted for Mr. Trump by nearly 20 points in 2016. A recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll found that McCaskill and Hawley are neck-and-neck, as each has 45 percent support among likely voters. CBS News rates the McCaskill-Hawley race as a \"toss up.\" Mr. Trump spent much of the time bashing McCaskill, saying that she'll \"never, ever vote for us.\" Hawley, however, is a \"star,\" according to the president. The affection was mutual -- Hawley said 20,000 people had to be turned away from the arena to see Mr. Trump. He pivoted from praising Mr. Trump to hitting McCaskill. \"There's somebody who hasn't been willing to work with the president of the United States -- that somebody is Claire McCaskill,\" Hawley said. After he retook the podium, Mr. Trump spent much of the speech reliving his 2016 presidential victory in an attempt to amp up rally attendees and encourage them to vote in the midterms, even though he won't be on the ballot. \"Get out in 2018 because you're voting for me in 2018,\" he said. He also called the 2016 election \"one of the greatest nights in the history of the country, but far less importantly, one of the greatest nights in the history of television.\"\u00a0 \"This November you make your voice heard, just like you did two Novembers ago, in the most exciting evening in a long time -- maybe ever,\" Mr. Trump said. He also hit familiar talking points, such as low unemployment rates, trade deals and building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. Mr. Trump especially criticized McCaskill for saying that she would vote against his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Referring to the current allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, the president said that he should be supported and \"women are for him more than anybody would understand.\" McCaskill announced her opposition Wednesday, citing his positions on campaign finance. \"While I am also uncomfortable about his view on presidential power as it relates to the rule of law, and his position that corporations are people, it is his allegiance to the position that unlimited donations and dark anonymous money, from even foreign interests, should be allowed to swamp the voices of individuals that has been the determining factor in my decision to vote no on his nomination,\" McCaskill said in a statement. I will vote no on Judge Kavanaugh. pic.twitter.com/AeNC6clHbq Hawley has said that he would support Kavanaugh's confirmation, and continued to support his nomination amid the allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted a woman when they were both in high school. \"The Democrats have played politics with this entire process and were opposed to Brett Kavanaugh before he was even nominated. They don't care about the truth,\" Hawley said Monday, according to St. Louis Public Radio. \"I believe allegations of sexual misconduct should never be disregarded. That's why it's important that both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh be heard immediately and under oath.\" Hawley also criticized McCaskill on Wednesday, writing on Twitter that her decision was \"no surprise\" and that McCaskill is \"just another Washington liberal.\" Mr. Trump's visit to Missouri also comes after The New York Times reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein allegedly suggested recording the president and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.

            "article_content": "Ohio gubernatorial candidates Mike DeWine and Richard Cordray face off in their first debate Wednesday. The two candidates faced off at the University of Dayton starting at 7 p.m. ET. This is not the first time the two have been opponents in an election \u2013 Republican DeWine ousted incumbent Democrat Cordray to become the Ohio attorney general in 2010. Cordray later became the leader of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The Ohio governor race is seen as a proxy battle between the Trumpian faction of the Republican Party and the centrist, Obama-influenced Democratic politics. President Trump has endorsed and appeared at a rally for DeWine, while former President Barack Obama has done the same for Cordray.  There will be two more debates before Election Day. They shook hands before the debate, but any illusion of cordiality between DeWine and Cordray faded during their opening statements. Cordray accused DeWine of acting as if he was entitled to Ohioans' votes, while DeWine said that Cordray was ineffective in his brief time as attorney general. Cordray served in that office for two years, while DeWine has been attorney general for eight years. The two tussled over the opioid crisis, one of the biggest issues in the debate. Cordray criticized DeWine for not doing enough to mitigate the crisis during his eight years as attorney general, saying that taking guidance from DeWine on the opioid epidemic was like \"asking for navigation advice from the captain of the Titanic.\" DeWine attacked Cordray for seeking to decriminalize some drug-related offenses. The two also sparred over hot-button issues such as gun control and abortion. Cordray is an opponent of the Heartbeat Bill, a bill in the state Legislature that would ban abortion even in cases of race, incest, and danger to the mother's life. DeWine said that he would sign the bill. Pro-choice activists believe that this bill would present an opportunity for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. At times, the candidates' attacks against their opponent became personal. \"You're all talk, and you've done nothing. You've been a failure in every job you've ever had,\" DeWine told Cordray at one point. The two also tried to assert both their independence from and ties to the president. \"I have said that when Donald Trump has done good things for the state of Ohio, I will work with him,\" Cordray said. \"When he's doing things that are bad for Ohio, I will stand up and fight against him.\" He praised Mr. Trump's plans to improve infrastructure nationwide, which have not been realized. DeWine said that he differed from Mr. Trump on certain issues, such as the separation of migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border. However, he said it was important to work with the president. \"No matter who the president is while I'm governor, we will have that good working relationship,\" DeWine said. He also praised Mr. Trump's nomination of conservative judges to federal courts. \"I think the president has done an excellent job on who he has appointed to the Supreme Court, but also the Circuit Court, and the District Court,\" DeWine said. A poll released Tuesday by Baldwin Wallace University found DeWine five points ahead of Cordray, with 42 percent to Cordray's 37 percent support among likely voters. Important issues in the race include the economy, health care, and gun control. Current Republican Governor John Kasich expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act during his tenure, which Cordray supports. DeWine has said that he would seek to reform Medicaid expansion, and that he supports adding work requirements to Medicaid. Many Ohioans receive treatment for opioid addiction through Medicaid.

            "article_content": "Former Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson began his campaign Tuesday to unseat New Mexico's junior Democratic senator, seeking political opportunity in the space between Democrats and voters loyal to President Donald Trump. Johnson, a former two-term governor of New Mexico, was added to the state's\u00a0list\u00a0of Senate candidates as final paperwork was being filed with election officials. His campaign manager said a formal announcement would come soon.\u00a0 Johnson remains popular in New Mexico and his entry into the U.S. Senate race that Democrats have been favored to win could complicate the party's national effort to hold seats or make gains in the chamber. Johnson's 2016 presidential bid as a Libertarian sputtered after a live-television gaff on foreign policy. Democrats saw the presidential run, with currents of social liberalism, as a bane to their party, even as Johnson criticized Trump for his treatment of women and border-wall proposal. Elected and re-elected governor of New Mexico as a Republican, Johnson stayed true to a small-government philosophy while vetoing more than 700 bills. His open advocacy for legalized marijuana broke mainstream 1990s political taboos and made him a national curiosity. Incumbent Martin Heinrich won the Senate seat in 2012, succeeding five-term Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman by beating out GOP Congresswoman Heather Wilson. This year's Republican Senate candidate is Mick Rich, an Albuquerque-based construction contractor and newcomer to politics. An internal poll released last week by Heinrich's campaign showed him easily winning a three-way race with 47 percent to 29 percent for Rich and 22 percent for Johnson.\u00a0 Rod Adair, a Republican political strategist and former state senator, said Johnson's reputation for disciplined, business-savvy governance and as an independent thinker could lure conservative, Hispanic Democrats as well as Republicans. \"Here's a guy who vetoed close to 900 bills and simply would not accept any increase in the size and scope of government,\" Adair said. \"That seems to be right in the wheelhouse of measurable disgust with both the left and the right. He may be the perfect third-party option right now.\" Johnson, a 65-year-old fitness enthusiast who has summited Mount Everest and this summer completed a grueling 2,700 mile (4,350 kilometer) bicycle race along the Continental Divide, says Democrats and Republicans alike are guilty of deficit spending and military overreach that he says limits economic freedom. A\u00a0campaign ad\u00a0rolled out Monday by the Elect Liberty PAC touts Johnson's image as a self-made businessman who is disciplined and competitive. Democratic Party Chairwoman Marg Elliston cautioned that Johnson's zeal for balanced budgets could translate into cuts to federal entitlement programs as pressure mounts to offset tax cuts signed by Trump last year. \"Over 1 million New Mexicans are on various forms of health care help from the federal government,\" she said. \"We need to take care of those people.\" In New Mexico, Johnson has been known for direct positions on policy and occasionally goofy behavior, once twirling a toy pig above his head at a news conference as he refused to sign a state budget proposal \u2014 unless pigs were to fly. In a Senate closely divided between Republicans and Democrats, Johnson's possible swing vote could hold outsized influence over national policy, said attorney A. Blair Dunn \u2014 a Johnson ally and the Libertarian candidate for attorney general. \"Gary basically becomes a power fulcrum, especially if he gets together with people like Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Cory Booker,\" Dunn said. Registered Libertarians make up a tiny sliver of the New Mexico electorate \u2014 less than 1 percent of registered voters. But the share of unaffiliated voters has steadily grown to 22 percent. Democrats dominate voter registration rolls, but the state has swung back and forth between Republican and Democratic governors for decades. New Mexico's longest-running senator was Republican Pete Domenici, who served from 1973 to 2009. Johnson's presidential prospects fizzled in 2016, two months before the election with his befuddled response to a television reporter's question about how to deal with a crisis in the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo. His reply \u2014 \"What is Aleppo?\" \u2014 earned him public derision.",

            "article_content": "Ohio Gov. John Kasich said Ohio voters who cast so many votes for Democrat Danny O'Connor in a solidly Republican district were \"sending a message to the Republicans to knock it off.\"\u00a0 The Republican governor made the comments in an exclusive interview with CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe, following the special election Tuesday night in Ohio's 12th Congressional District that is still too close to call. President Trump and the GOP have declared victory for Republican Troy Balderson, but no major news outlet has yet called the race for either candidate. Kasich suggested he believes a number of Republican women voted for O'Connor over Balderson. \"Well, the voters here sent a message to the Republicans to knock it off,\" Kasich, who has been critical of Mr. Trump, told O'Keefe. \"Stop the chaos, the division, no more of this family separation that we see at the border or taking people's healthcare away. I think that have \u2014 basically have had enough and they're sending a message to the Republicans, including the Republican in the White House...And what happened here, in this district, people will not, maybe not understand this. This district is so Republican, there should never even have been an election here. And it was so close and -- in one of the counties that's so solidly Republican -- where a Republican would normally win by 70 percent, it broke basically 50-50.\" \"So, some Republicans sat at home, but what I think happened, and we don't have all the numbers yet, I think you will find a lot of Republican women who not only didn't sit at home, but a significant percentage, or some percentage of them voted for the Democrat,\" he added. Mr. Trump, who held a rally for Balderson last week, has already taken credit for what he sees as a Balderson win. But Kasich didn't think the president should be so comfortable, and the close race \"was a vote on the president.\" When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson, he was down in early voting 64 to 36. That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better. Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He will win BIG in Nov. \"Well look, first of all, the seat is overwhelmingly Republican,\" Kasich said. \"It shouldn't have been this close and if this, this really, I don't think, wasn't a vote on Balderson or a vote on the Democrat, I think it was a vote on the president. And I think the message was you gotta stop doing what you're doing. All these tweets, all this disruption, all this chaos, all this division, all the negativity. It has to stop. That's what I think they were saying.\" Democrats, Kasich said, are motivated ahead of the midterm elections, and as Republicans battle to hold onto the House, a number of districts are potentially even more vulnerable than Ohio's 12th Congressional District. Republicans, he claimed, are \"turned off,\" and some are beginning to vote for Democrats. \"We may be entering, may on the edge of entering a post-partisan environment where people are gonna start thinking a little more about the person and a little bit less about the party,\" Kasich said. \"In my opinion, that's good for the country, but I hope my party will think about what we're doing in Ohio to help people from top to bottom. To me, that's the winning message.\" The former 2016 presidential candidate, who has attempted to keep his profile a national one, also didn't rule out the possibility of another presidential bid Wednesday. \"I've said that all my options are on the table,\" Kasich said. \"I happen to believe -- and I'm a positive populist, the president is a negative populist -- I believe that people do have serious problems, but I think they can be lifted. I don't play the victim game. Now, I don't know where that's gonna take me, but I'm gonna keep doing what I have been doing for several years now -- and including on that debate stage -- to talk positively about the future of our country.\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "President Trump hit his familiar targets such as the media and Democrats Saturday at a campaign rally in Ohio, his third campaign rally this week. Mr. Trump also praised his supporters as the \"real elite,\" saying the \"forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.\"\u00a0 \"You know what they talk about? They talk about the elite,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The elite. Do you ever see the elite? They're not the elite, you are the elite. You are the elite.\" After receiving applause, Mr. Trump went on to call his supporters are \"smarter\" than the elite, and \"make bigger incomes.\" \"The elite -- they're more elite than me? I am better than everything they have, including this,\" Mr. Trump said, pointing to his head. \"And I became president and they didn't, meaning you became president. And it's driving them crazy.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump went after CNN, which earned cheers of \"CNN sucks\" from the crowd, and also hit at MSNBC before praising Fox News anchors.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mr. Trump was in Lewis Center Ohio to drum up support for Republican state senator Troy Balderson, who is running against Democrat Danny O'Connor in a Tuesday special election in the state's 12th Congressional District. The president already stumped for Republicans this week in Florida and Pennsylvania. Mr. Trump's support may be crucial in the central Ohio district, where Balderson and O'Connor are close in recent polls. A Monmouth University poll released earlier this week gave Balderson only a one-point lead over O'Connor in the traditionally Republican district. The seat was vacated by Republican Rep. Pat Tiberi, who left Congress before his term was up. Accompanying the president's team aboard Air Force One en route to the rally is Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director. It was unclear Saturday why Hicks, who left the White House in March, was accompanying the president's team. \"Will be going to Ohio tonight to campaign for Troy Balderson for the big Congressional Special Election on Tuesday,\" the president tweeted. \"Early voting is on. Troy is strong on Crime, the Border & loves our Military, Vets & 2nd Amendment. His opponent is a puppet of Nancy Pelosi/high taxes.\" Will be going to Ohio tonight to campaign for Troy Balderson for the big Congressional Special Election on Tuesday. Early voting is on. Troy is strong on Crime, the Border & loves our Military, Vets & 2nd Amendment. His opponent is a puppet of Nancy Pelosi/high taxes. Troy Balderson, running for Congress from Ohio, is in a big Election fight with a candidate who just got caught lying about his relationship with Nancy Pelosi, who is weak on Crime, Borders & your 2nd Amendment-and wants to raise your Taxes (by a lot). Vote for Troy on Tuesday! Mr. Trump's visit to Ohio comes after he attacked NBA star LeBron James, who until last month played for the Cleveland Cavaliers and is an iconic figure in the state. LeBron recently signed to play for the Lakers in Los Angeles. LeBron is from Akron, Ohio, and recently opened a school there for underprivileged children.\u00a0 Mr. Trump insulted James' intelligence on Twitter late Friday night, saying CNN's Don Lemon \"made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\" First lady Melania Trump on Saturday, via her spokeswoman, broke from her husband's statement, saying James is doing good things for children and expressing she is open to visiting his school. \"It looks like LeBron James is working to do good things on behalf of our next generation and just as she always has, the first lady encourages everyone to have an open dialogue about issues facing children today,\" the first lady's spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement. \"As you know, Mrs. Trump has traveled the country and world talking to children about their well-being, healthy living, and the importance of responsible online behavior with her Be Best initiative. Her platform centers around visiting organizations, hospitals and schools, and she would be open to visiting the I Promise School in Akron.\"",

            "article_content": "How bad was the reaction from the Right to the POTUS-Putin presser?\u00a0 My tweet traffic from TrumpWorld fell so low I thought they'd all been dumped Twitter's recent purge. Instead of the usual celebrations and snark that accompany Trump's TV appearance, it was social-media silence from the #MAGA gang. Even die-hard Trump supporters knew something had gone wrong. If they flipped over to Fox News for comfort, they found Bret Baier describing some of President Trump's comments \"a little bit bizarre.\" His colleague Brit Hume agreed, calling Trump's response to the question of Russian interference in the 2016 election \"a vague and rambling non-answer,\" adding \"Lame response, to say the least.\" Neil Cavuto called Trump's performance \"disgusting.\" And those were Trump's good reviews. The vast majority of reactions from Republican and the Right sounded more like this from Mark Dubowitz at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies: \"That was the most disturbing press conference I've watched in my lifetime.\" That was the most disturbing press conference I\u2019ve watched in my lifetime. Any I\u2019m forgetting more disturbing? https://t.co/8mqvcR0ZA7 In a way, the past two weeks put a spotlight on the dilemma Trump supporters face. A week ago the conversation was about Judge Kavanaugh and the economy.\u00a0 A number of anti-Trump activists I know confessed that they were re-thinking their opposition to the president -- not because they are any more comfortable with his character (if anything, they say, his behavior's actually worse than they feared) -- but because, as Noah Rothman of the conservative \"Commentary Magazine\" put it, \"they find it's difficult not supporting an administration that has done so much they support. They [anti-Trump Republicans] face a tough decision in 2020.\" Monday's press conference made that decision a whole lot easier. It's too soon to tell, but it feels like the GOP ground has shifted away from Trump. There's no surprise when Sen. Ben Sasse calls President Trump's claim of moral equivalency between the Russians who attacked our election institutions and their American victims is \"bizarre and flat-out wrong.\" \"He's giving Putin a propaganda win he desperately needs,\" Sasse said in a statement. But when frequent Trump defenders like Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Trey Gowdy call him out for his misstatements, that's a different story. House Speaker Paul Ryan has spent the past year trying avoid conflict with the president, but he felt the need to put out a statement refuting the president's claims. \"There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals,\" Ryan said. \"The United States must be focused on holding Russia accountable and putting an end to its vile attacks on democracy.\" Trump fans console themselves that their man has been in these messes before and always finds a way out. Any mere mortal politician would have been taken down by the revelations of his treatment of women back during the 2016 election, or the story of Stormy Daniels afterward. Not Trump. He was stronger than that. But the \"Trump's different\" argument this time feels, well, different. Trump looked so weak, so wan, so out of his league next to Putin. Perhaps for the first time, the job of being president looked so much bigger than the person holding it.\u00a0  Trump's super-power is to get the media focused on something else. He's no doubt flexing his Twitter fingers at this very moment to spin out to another story -- NFL kneeling? MS-13? Elvis's Alien Grandchild? Plus, there's Trump's actual record on Russia. Despite all the pillow talk with Putin, Trump has kept Obama-era sanctions in place, added new sanctions of his own, reversed Obama policies by giving offensive weapons to Ukraine and missile-defense systems to Poland, and allowed our military to wipe out a large group of Russian mercenaries fighting for Syria's Assad regime.  And don't underestimate the ability of the Democrats to take a strong hand and completely overplay it.\u00a0 The issue of arresting illegal immigrant families at the border, for example, was buried under the far-Left push to completely #AbolishICE. Today's tweet from former CIA director John Brennan calling for Trump's press-conference performance an impeachable offense could wind up helping Trump by making his opponents appear more problematic than the president. But it's also possible that the image of the American president, weak and unsteady, siding with a KGB thug over his own country, will have a lasting effect on this presidency.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u2014 Hey, did my congressman really say that? Is that really President Trump on that video, or am I being duped? New technology on the internet lets anyone make videos of real people appearing to say things they've never said. Republicans and Democrats predict this high-tech way of putting words in someone's mouth will become the latest weapon in disinformation wars against the United States and other Western democracies. We're not talking about lip-syncing videos. This technology uses facial mapping and artificial intelligence to produce videos that appear so genuine it's hard to spot the phonies. Lawmakers and intelligence officials worry that the bogus videos \u2014 called deepfakes \u2014 could be used to threaten national security or interfere in elections. So far, that hasn't happened, but experts say it's not a question of if, but when. \"I expect that here in the United States we will start to see this content in the upcoming midterms and national election two years from now,\" said Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. \"The technology, of course, knows no borders, so I expect the impact to ripple around the globe.\" When an average person can create a realistic fake video of the president saying anything they want, Farid said, \"we have entered a new world where it is going to be difficult to know how to believe what we see.\" The reverse is a concern, too. People may dismiss as fake genuine footage, say of a real atrocity, to score political points. Realizing the implications of the technology, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is already two years into a four-year program to develop technologies that can detect fake images and videos. Right now, it takes extensive analysis to identify phony videos. It's unclear if new ways to authenticate images or detect fakes will keep pace with deepfake technology. Deepfakes are so named because they utilize deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence. They are made by feeding a computer an algorithm, or set of instructions, lots of images and audio of a certain person. The computer program learns how to mimic the person's facial expressions, mannerisms, voice and inflections. If you have enough video and audio of someone, you can combine a fake video of the person with a fake audio and get them to say anything you want. So far, deepfakes have mostly been used to smear celebrities or as gags, but it's easy to foresee a nation state using them for nefarious activities against the U.S., said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of several members of the Senate intelligence committee who are expressing concern about deepfakes. A foreign intelligence agency could use the technology to produce a fake video of an American politician using a racial epithet or taking a bribe, Rubio says. They could use a fake video of a U.S. soldier massacring civilians overseas, or one of a U.S. official supposedly admitting a secret plan to carry out a conspiracy. Imagine a fake video of a U.S. leader \u2014 or an official from North Korea or Iran \u2014 warning the United States of an impending disaster. \"It's a weapon that could be used \u2014 timed appropriately and placed appropriately \u2014 in the same way fake news is used, except in a video form, which could create real chaos and instability on the eve of an election or a major decision of any sort,\" Rubio told The Associated Press. Deepfake technology still has a few hitches. For instance, people's blinking in fake videos may appear unnatural. But the technology is improving. \"Within a year or two, it's going to be really hard for a person to distinguish between a real video and a fake video,\" said Andrew Grotto, an international security fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University in California. \"This technology, I think, will be irresistible for nation states to use in disinformation campaigns to manipulate public opinion, deceive populations and undermine confidence in our institutions,\" Grotto said. He called for government leaders and politicians to clearly say it has no place in civilized political debate. Crude videos have been used for malicious political purposes for years, so there's no reason to believe the higher-tech ones, which are more realistic, won't become tools in future disinformation campaigns. Rubio noted that in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow complained to the Russian Foreign Ministry about a fake sex video it said was made to damage the reputation of a U.S. diplomat. The video showed the married diplomat, who was a liaison to Russian religious and human rights groups, making telephone calls on a dark street. The video then showed the diplomat in his hotel room, scenes that apparently were shot with a hidden camera. Later, the video appeared to show a man and a woman having sex in the same room with the lights off, although it was not at all clear that the man was the diplomat. John Beyrle, who was the U.S. ambassador in Moscow at the time, blamed the Russian government for the video, which he said was clearly fabricated. Michael McFaul, who was American ambassador in Russia between 2012 and 2014, said Russia has engaged in disinformation videos against various political actors for years and that he too had been a target. He has said that Russian state propaganda inserted his face into photographs and \"spliced my speeches to make me say things I never uttered and even accused me of pedophilia.\"",

He said he doesn't think Americans want a \"dog-eat-dog world where everybody is angry all the time,\" and he also suggested that Democrats have it within their power to effect a change. \"The simple message right now is that if people participate and they vote, then this democracy works.\" The former president also warned the donors against complacency. \"I would caution us from extrapolating too much from a bunch of special elections and starting to think that, 'OK, this will take care of itself.' Because it won't,\" he said, going on to note the power fear has to motivate voters.\u00a0 \"Vote, participate, get involved,\" he advised, even if the message and the messenger aren't perfect, and even if there's no \"tingle in your spine\" and \"you're expecting politicians to be so inspiring and poetic and moving.\"\u00a0 \"Politics, like life, is imperfect. But there is better and there is worse,\" he said. According to the L.A. Times, tickets for the fundraiser started at $2,700 to attend the discussion between Obama and Perez and see a musical performance by Christina Aguilera. Donors paying $100,000 received five dinner tickets, a photo with Mr. Obama, and membership to the DNC finance committee. KQED's Marisa Lagos, in San Francisco, where the former president will be attending another fundraiser Friday, told CBSN in a \"Local Matters\" segment that she spoke with Obama senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, who also stressed the importance of turnout and said Democrats should focus on people who agree with them but maybe haven't been excited enough to show up at the polls. Lagos characterized Pfeiffer's guidance to Democrats: \"If we think that what Trump is doing on the border is illegal or immoral, we need to say that. But we also need to add to the end of that sentence. ... We also need to protect health care, we also need to protect the environment.\"\u00a0 \"They need to be careful to not to let him lead every conversation,\" she added.\u00a0 In the Bay Area, Mr. Obama will be appearing Friday with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California and Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-California.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "MIAMI -- Politicians are being targeted in Mexico ahead of the country's July elections, and the latest murder was caught on surveillance video. The footage shows Mexican congressional candidate Fernando Puron posing for a selfie with a supporter after a campaign debate last Friday, when a man walks up from behind, raises a gun and fires at the back of his head. Puron was running on an anti-cartel platform which made him a target in Piedras Negras, which borders Texas. He is now one of 113 candidates and politicians who have been murdered in Mexico just since last September, when the election cycle started. Fifty relatives have also been killed and 132 politicians, mostly at the local level, have been threatened.  CBS News spoke to the current mayor of Piedras Negras, Sonia Villarreal, who says her life was threatened just one day earlier. When asked if she was fearing the cartels, she said \"no,\" but she did put her re-election bid on hold to focus on the investigation into Puron's death. The wave of violence comes as 15,000 candidates run for the most open government positions Mexico has ever had. Drug cartels and organized criminals are trying to silence those who would threaten their hold on lucrative smuggling routes to the world's number one consumer of illegal drugs, the U.S. But it's not just politicians being targeted. Last summer, for \"CBSN: On Assignment,\" CBS News reported Mexico had become the most dangerous country in the western hemisphere for reporters. We spoke with Carlos Lauria, who has been pushing for better security. \"It's impeding the possibility of Mexicans to engage in a public debate of the issues that are affecting the daily lives of Mexicans,\" Lauria said. Meanwhile, Villarreal plans to start campaigning again, but with increased security. Manuel Bojorquez is a CBS News national correspondent based in Miami.

            "article_content": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 The new mayor of a mostly polygamous town on the Utah-Arizona border is finishing off a complete overhaul of municipal staff and boards after mass resignations when she took office in January to become the first woman and first non-member of the polygamous sect to hold the seat. Six of the seven Hildale, Utah, town workers quit after Mayor Donia Jessop was elected and took charge of the local government run by the sect for more than a century. They were joined by nine members of various town boards, including utility board chairman Jacob N. Jessop. All were members of the sect, the mayor said. Jacob Jessop said his religious beliefs prevented him from working for a woman and with people who are not sect members, according to resignation letters obtained Thursday by The Associated Press through a public records request. The mayor's husband is distantly related to Jessop in the town of about 3,000 people where many have that last name. \"It has come to a point where I have to choose between my religion and participation in city government, and I choose my religion,\" he wrote in his letter dated Jan. 25. \"My religion teaches me that I should not follow a woman for a leader in a public or family capacity.\" He cited sermons from the 1860s from Brigham Young, the second president of the mainstream Mormon church who led pioneers west to settle in Utah. Polygamy was part of early Mormonism, but The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has disavowed polygamy for more than a century. He added in the letter that his religion teaches him \"to leave apostates alone severely and not have anything to do with them.\" Apostates refer to people who renounce their religion's teachings. Most of the others who resigned said in their letters they were taking other jobs. But Mayor Jessop said all of them are members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, of FLDS, an offshoot of mainstream Mormonism that practices polygamy. The group has run the sister cities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, for more than a century and had total control of town governments until November's elections. The victory by Donia Jessop and wins by three other non-sect members for city council seats marked the latest sign of the polygamous group's waning control of the community surrounded by striking red cliffs near Zion National Park. The new town leadership is the latest sign that the community's demographics are shifting as it begins to resemble a typical town in the U.S. West, not a cloistered religious community. Government-ordered evictions of sect families from about 150 homes forced many to seek refuge in trailers around town or in different cities. The town government and police are being watched closely by court-appointed monitors after a jury found them guilty of civil rights violations. Also, a food-stamp fraud case led 10 people to plead guilty and exacerbated a leadership void. Donia Jessop and other former sect members who have returned to the town consider the changes progress that will help the community break free from the reign of Warren Jeffs, who is serving life in prison in Texas for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered brides. But sect members believe the town they built and love is being ripped away from them, that Jeffs is their prophet and was wrongly convicted. More changes could be coming \u2014 two city council members who weren't up for re-election in November did not attend first two regular meetings of the year. If they miss the next meeting in April, their absences will be considered resignations per a new city resolution passed in January, Donia Jessop said. Later this year, elections in the sister city of Colorado City, Arizona, could bring in outsiders, including to the mayor's seat. Donia Jessop is a former member of the religious group but left four years ago over unrest about Jeffs was running the group. She returned to Hildale to buy an evicted member's home and start a business. She is in a plural marriage but no longer follows the tenets of the FLDS religion. She said she laughed when she read the letter from Jacob N. Jessop's on her desk. \"I knew that that was out there, but for it to be so blatant, spelled out so perfectly, it was quite a shock,\" Donia Jessop said in a phone interview. \"If you cannot work with me, then it's good that you are moving on because this is the future of Hildale and I'm not going anywhere.\" The resignations were first reported by the St. George News, but the copy of Jacob N. Jessop's resignation letter was not made public until this week in response to the records request by The Associated Press and another media outlet. The mayor said the resignations haven't been disruptive, with the employees leaving incrementally to avoid leaving the town completely unstaffed. She said she asked each to reconsider, but only one of those who resigned decided to stay. Donia Jessop said she has filled the positions that include town recorder, clerk and treasurer with former members of the FLDS and other people with no ties to the sect. New hires should help the community, said Jared Nicol, a new town council member and mainstream Mormon. \"It's going to ensure that everybody in the city is being considered and represented,\" he said.",

Ted Cruz, reportedly met with former President Barack Obama amid speculation he is mulling a presidential bid in 2020.\u00a0 According to The Washington Post, Obama held a meeting with O'Rourke in his post-presidency offices in Washington last month. Although O'Rourke told CBS News' \"60 Minutes\"\u00a0before Election Day that, win or lose, he would not run for office in 2020, the progressive Texas congressman walked back his pledge two weeks ago and did not rule out a future bid.\u00a0 During a town hall in his border district in late November, O'Rourke said he and his wife will \"think about what we can do next to contribute to the best of our ability to this community\" after his third congressional term concludes in January.\u00a0 Many Democratic operatives and donors are encouraging O'Rourke to launch a presidential campaign and challenge President Trump in 2020. If he does, the Texas lawmaker is expected to enter a crowded field of Democratic contenders hoping to energize the liberal opposition to the Trump administration and retake the White House.\u00a0 Possible candidates include former Vice President Joe Biden; senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren; former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro; Bay Area Rep. Eric Swalwell; and Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti. A number of other Democrats have also suggested that they are considering a bid.\u00a0 O'Rourke's robust, unabashedly liberal senate bid in deep-red Texas \u2014 along with his Obama-esque oratory prowess on the campaign trail \u2014 catapulted him to national fame this year. Although he failed to unseat Cruz, O'Rourke galvanized a broad electoral coalition in Texas, including the state's large and growing Latino community, and lost by less than three percentage points.\u00a0 In a fiery speech following his Election Day defeat, O'Rourke told his ardent supporters, \"I love you more than words can express. And that love will persist every single day going forward, making sure that whatever we have created and whatever we have changed \u2014 and all of us will decide what that means and how far it goes \u2014 that it leads to something far greater than what we have today.\" \"We will see you out there down the road,\" he added.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Democrats' takeover of the House ended two years of full GOP control in Washington, during which \u2014 theoretically speaking \u2014 President Trump had full rein to implement his conservative agenda. But as Mr. Trump learned the hard way with Republicans' failure to fully repeal Obamacare, and his inability to secure anywhere near sufficient funding for a border wall, even full Republican control of both chambers of Congress and the White House isn't always enough.\u00a0 While the president has long complained of Democrats' \"obstruction,\" despite Republicans controlling Congress, the last two years of working the system will be a breeze compared to what the next two likely will be. Mr. Trump, who wants to pass a second wave of tax cuts and end birthright citizenship, will find it much harder to accomplish those things legislatively. Democrats can quite easily block the president's desired agenda. Mr. Trump himself admitted the 10 percent tax cuts he wanted for \u00a0the middle class likely won't happen without Republicans at the helm.  That leaves the president with few options. He could compromise with them \u2014 one of Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's aides said Mr. Trump expressed to her that he liked her message of bipartisanship in her victory speech Tuesday. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he thinks legislation on prison reform and infrastructure has a good chance of passing. Mr. Trump himself mentioned infrastructure\u00a0and drug pricing\u00a0 in a press conference that was quite laudatory of Pelosi, a stark contrast from his caustic words on the campaign trail.\u00a0 But anything much more controversial than that might not.  If there are roadblocks on Capitol Hill, the president could take executive action, a power he has resorted to before, despite his frequent criticism of former President Obama for the same thing. Mr. Trump, who worked to deregulate industries and dismantle Obama-era programs through executive order, has already threatened to end birthright citizenship with his signature. \"I believe that you can have a simple vote in Congress, or it's even possible, in my opinion \u2014   this is after meeting with some very talented legal scholars \u2014 that you can do it through an executive order,\" Mr. Trump said last week about birthright citizenship. \"Now, I'd rather do it through Congress, because that's permanent. But we can certainly do it through \u2014 I really believe we can do it through executive order.\" Democrats' control of the House also means they will run all of the lower chamber's committees. From the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to the House Ways and Means Committee, Democrats will control the agenda, the schedules, and what kind of investigations they pursue.\u00a0 For Mr. Trump, that means Democrats will have every opportunity to obtain the president's tax returns, which he has refused to hand over since before the election. Democrats are also poised to launch or continue probes into the president's businesses and potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Trump never fully divested from his businesses upon assuming office, and Democrats are unsatisfied with the lack of information on how the president and his family might be profiting from transactions the public can't see. Litigation is already pending claiming foreign payments to Mr. Trump's businesses violate the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\u00a0 But Mr. Trump isn't the only Republican in the executive branch with cause for concern \u2014 Democrats are also poised to launch or continue probes into Cabinet-level secretaries and federal agencies.\u00a0 The Democrats who won Tuesday night take office in January.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "GARY, Ind. -- Former President Obama praised Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Sunday for being willing to break with his party, telling a roaring crowd at a rally in the state that \"you don't want just a yes man.\" Donnelly has sounded more like President Trump while trying to persuade voters in the conservative Midwestern state to grant him a second term. He's angered some Democrats by tacking to the right in recent weeks and embracing some of Mr. Trump's pet priorities, such as building a border wall with Mexico. But Mr. Obama told voters during the rally in Gary that Donnelly \"tries to do right by people\" - not just his party - and noted he supported the Affordable Care Act, the health care overhaul passed under Mr. Obama. \"Joe Donnelly and I didn't agree all the time. But Joe always let me know where he stood and I knew what he believed in and that he always was focused on: 'What's the best thing for the Hoosiers that he served?\"' Mr. Obama said. \"He was honest and he was direct. So you can count on that. That's what you want. You don't want just a yes man all the time.\" Mr. Obama's stop was sandwiched between his successor's trips to the state Friday and Monday on behalf of GOP Senate candidate Mike Braun. It was also part of a series of appearances as the two presidents hit the campaign trail hard appearances in the days leading to Tuesday's midterm elections. For Braun, a businessman who has campaigned as a steadfast Trump ally, the current president's appearances in Indianapolis and Fort Wayne are no-brainers in a state he won two years ago by 19 points.  But for Donnelly, who frequently touts how often he votes with Mr. Trump, the Obama rally was a little more complicated. \"If he does need to inoculate himself from some of his firmer conservative rhetoric, it's a pretty effective way to do it,\" said Christina Hale, a former state lawmaker and the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2016. Mr. Obama has proven a polarizing figure with independent and Republican voters and is credited with some of Indiana's rightward political shift, even though he won the state in 2008. To win in Tuesday's election, Donnelly not only needs high turnout from his party's base but also must peel off some moderate Republicans and independents. That's why Sunday's rally in Gary, a heavily African-American city that has more in common with the Democratic stronghold of nearby Chicago than deep red parts of the state, could prove strategic. The northwest Indiana region supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, and driving turnout there on Tuesday will be critical for Donnelly. A spokesman for Braun, Josh Kelley, said Donnelly was \"doubling down on the liberal resistance movement\" by campaigning with Mr. Obama. Mr. Obama criticized Republicans for passing a tax bill that benefited the wealthy and for trying to end protections for pre-existing conditions provided through the Affordable Care Act. And without mentioning Mr. Trump's name, he told the crowd they could return the country to a kinder, less divisive kind of politics. \"On Tuesday you can vote for politics that is decent and honest and lawful and tries to do right by people like Joe Donnelly does,\" he said, adding at one point that his voice was growing hoarse from all his campaigning in recent days. Mr. Trump was keenly aware of Mr. Obama's visit, which he mentioned Friday during an event at an Indianapolis-area high school. \"It's no surprise that Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this weekend with Barack H. Mr. Obama,\" Mr. Trump said as the crowd jeered. He later added: \"We don't want to go back to the Mr. Obama days.\" As a red-state Democrat, Donnelly has had a target on his back ever since he unexpectedly defeated Republican Richard Mourdock in 2012, when the former state treasurer said a woman who gets pregnant from her rapist is carrying a \"gift from God.\" Donnelly has walked a delicate line since then, often frustrating his own party and Republicans alike with the votes he takes. Mr. Trump was having none of it on Friday, tying Donnelly to \"radical left\" figures in the party who are widely reviled by the GOP base.",

            "article_content": "A new study on Latin American sentiment finds that Hispanics are not aware of huge advances from within their own community. The study, from a partnership between research group Zeno and \"We Are All Human,\" paints a positive picture about Latinos in the United States. It says that 86 percent of all new business in the U.S. in the last decade were started by Latinos, a fact which surprised most respondents. It also found that Latinas create business at a rate six times faster than any other group in the U.S. Claudia Romo Edelman, host of the Global Goalscast podcast and a special adviser to \"We Are All Human,\" says that without a voice to speak on their behalf, this good news has largely gone unreported.\u00a0 \"We can be that community that will be the main motor of the middle class of America moving forward, and the perception willchange from criminal, waiter, or pizza deliverer to, 'Oh my God, please come and work here in my company!'\"\u00a0 Romo Edelman echoes a statistic referenced in the report, which suggests that the Latino community fails to speak with a united voice. \"Our young generations deserve to be guided and there's a lot of people that can be a role model, they just need to speak up and we just need to provide them with the right platforms.\" Latinos make up 18 percent of the U.S. population, earn an average $45,000 income, generate 12 percent of the GDP and are 40 percent of the new workers, the report says \u2014 a result several generations of upward mobility.\u00a0 The report lays out vast untapped potential and is the flipside of a markedly more negative study published earlier in the year. The Edelman Trust Barometer report for 2018 showed a continued collapse in trust of institutions in the U.S., but that collapse was even more marked among Latino populations. It found that employer trust among U.S. Hispanics is 13 points lower than in the general population. \"That meant the Hispanic community felt betrayed and felt bruised after the election,\" said Romo Edelman. That bruising started, arguably, the day President Donald Trump announced his intention to run in a speech pockmarked with racist comments about Mexicans crossing the border, calling them rapists and criminals. \"The midterm elections will be very important for Hispanics to demonstrate whether they have understood their voice and their power,\" said Romo Edelman. She is taking a sabbatical from her role at the U.N. to become an unofficial Chief Marketing Officer for the Latin American community, and believes that by the time 2020 rolls around, Latinos could significantly improve their lot and find a louder voice. \"This community's powerful, it shines, it has everything that it needs and yet the packaging is so negative, is so appalling, is so downwards.\" \"Having worked and as a marketer for my entire life and having worked on projects or products that needed to be packaged in a way to be sent out to the world to be understood, normally the product is really hard, right? This is the first time in my life in which the equation is inverse.\" Is it possible to change the world? Can we still make the planet a better place for us all to live? UN special adviser Claudia Romo Edelman and Hub Culture executive editor Edie Lush -- hosts of the\u00a0Global Goalscast\u00a0-- believe the answer is a resounding 'yes,' and that everyone can play a part.

Dave Brat, a Republican facing an unexpectedly tight race for re-election, compared the struggles of inmates he was visiting to negative campaign ads against him. Brat made the comments while touring Chesterfield County Jail, speaking to inmates with substance abuse issues. \"You think you're having a hard time -- I got $5\u2009million worth of negative ads going at me,\" Brat said. \"How do you think I'm feeling? Nothing's easy. For anybody. You think -- I'm a congressman -- 'Oh, life's easy. This guys's off having steaks.' Baloney, I got a daughter, she's got to deal with that crap on TV every day. It's tough.\" His opponent, Abigail Spanberger has raised nearly twice as much as Brat -- nearly $5 million. The CBS News Battleground Tracker rates that race as a \"toss up.\" After discussing his campaign woes, Brat walked back his comments at the jail a little, saying that he was not denying the inmates had difficult lives. \"No one's out there that got some easy life,\" Brat said. \"And you've got it hard -- I'm not dismissing that. You've got some real, fierce anxieties.\" According to the Washington Post, Brat's visit to the jail was organized by his congressional office and not a campaign event, but he was trying to relate with the inmates by discussing his own struggles. Spanberger\u00a0tweeted her criticism of Brat's behavior at the jail Thursday. \"It is absolutely shameful for @DaveBratVA7th to compare the hardship of addiction and the struggles of recovery to his campaign. This is an affront to every person in recovery and the Virginians who die daily due to their addiction. #VA07,\" she wrote. In a Facebook post published Thursday, Sheriff Karl Leonard of Chesterfield County expressed dismay at how Brat's visit was being portrayed. \"I am personally displeased that an issue that I have worked so hard to prevent from being politicized has now ended up being nothing more than just a political football,\" Leonard said, referring to drug addiction recovery of inmates. \"Never once did Congressman Brat say \"vote for me\" or say anything disparaging about his opponent at all. That's because this was never intended to be a campaign stop. Unfortunately it has turned it into a campaign issue now.\" President Trump endorsed Brat via Twitter on Thursday. \"Congressman @DaveBratVA7th is one of the hardest working, and smartest, people in Washington.

            "article_content": "KABUL, Afghanistan -- Three U.S. nationals were wounded on Thursday in a shooting at the residence of the governor of Afghanistan's Kandahar province. Top U.S. commander in the country, Gen. Austin Scott Miller, was attending an event with other U.S. and Afghan officials at the governor's palace, but he was not injured, the Pentagon said. One of the U.S. military's most valuable allies in the region was killed, however, along with two other Afghan officials. \"Initial reports indicate this was an Afghan-on-Afghan incident,\" Col. Knut Peters, a spokesman for the U.S.-led Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan said in the written statement.\u00a0 \"We can now confirm three Americans were wounded - one service member, one civilian and one contractor,\" Peters told CBS News Radio correspondent Cami McCormick. \"General Miller is uninjured.\" Kandahar's deputy provincial governor Agha Lala Dastageri said powerful provincial police chief Abdul Razik and the province's intelligence chief Abdul Mohmin died immediately in the attack and provincial governor Zalmay Wesa died of his injuries at a hospital.  The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said Raziq was specifically targeted.\u00a0 The Taliban claimed it was an \"insider attack\" -- one carried out by a sympathetic member of the Afghan security forces. The militant group sent a photo to journalists of a young man in an Afghan border police uniform, whom it identified as the attacker.\u00a0 Gen Raziq has been a powerful American ally in southern Afghanistan. A potent foe of the Taliban, Raziq claimed to have survived 24 past attempts on his life. CBS News' Ahmad Mukhtar reports that Raziq was an influential figure not only in Kandahar province, but throughout southern Afghanistan.\u00a0 Officials told Mukhtar that the attack took place outside the room where Gen. Miller had been meeting other officials, as Raziq and others were leaving.\u00a0 The attack in Kandahar came a day after a Taliban suicide bomber slammed into a NATO convoy near the capital city, Kabul, killing two civilians and injuring five Czech troops, Afghan officials and the Czech military said Thursday. That attack, which took place late Wednesday in the district of Bagram in Parwan province, also wounded three Afghan civilians, said Wahida Shakar, spokeswoman for the provincial governor. Bagram is about 24 miles from Kabul and is also the home of a sprawling U.S. military base.  The attack on the NATO convoy came at the end of a particularly violent day across Afghanistan as tensions rise ahead of the country's parliamentary elections on Saturday. A Taliban bombing in southern Helmand province killed a candidate running in the elections. \u00a0 As CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, the Taliban -- and the ISIS faction in Afghanistan -- are doing all they can to disrupt the democratic process. U.S. troops are helping their Afghan counterparts beat back the Islamic extremists. In recent months, Afghan troops have come under near-daily attacks. NATO troops, which handed over security to Afghan forces at the end of 2014, mostly train and assist with air power. So far this year, eight U.S. soldiers and three other NATO service members have died in Afghanistan. This week, D'Agata joined American soldiers who were in the fifth grade when the war began in 2001, as they directed Afghan forces in operations to clear ISIS-held villages in eastern Afghanistan's Nangarhar province.  U.S. commanders on the ground have told D'Agata the fight against the extremists has changed a lot since the American invasion, with a far greater reliance on technology and drones to keep U.S. forces and their allies out of harm's way.  Company commander Maj. Kirby Robinson is on his second tour in Afghanistan, and he told D'Agata that, while Afghanistan's forces are reclaiming territory -- sometimes easily -- he wouldn't say they're \"winning.\" \"I wouldn't use the word 'winning.' I wouldn't use the word 'losing,'\" he said. \"I want to use the word 'impact.' I think that's the biggest word -- best word for what we're doing.\" But with 14,000 American troops still serving in Afghanistan, D'Agata says it may still be too early to know what impact the new tactics are having. Afghan military losses continue to be so high, that the government no longer releases the figures.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump declared a reprieve Monday for Rod Rosenstein, saying he has no plans to fire his deputy attorney general whose future has been the source of intense speculation for two weeks. \"I'm not making any changes,\" Trump told reporters as he returned to the White House after traveling with Rosenstein to an international police chiefs' conference in Florida. \"We just had a very nice talk. We actually get along.\" The flight provided an opportunity for their most extensive conversation since news reports last month that Rosenstein had discussed the possibilities in early 2017 of secretly recording Trump to expose chaos in the White House and invoking constitutional provisions to have him removed from office. Those reports triggered an avalanche of speculation about the future of Rosenstein \u2014 and also the special counsel's investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. The deputy attorney general appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to his special counsel post and closely oversees his work. Trump said earlier in the day that he had \"a very good relationship\" with Rosenstein and was eager to speak with him aboard Air Force One on the flight to Florida. They did talk, for about 45 minutes, but not alone, a White House spokesman said. The subjects: violent crime in Chicago, support for local law enforcement, border security, the conference they were flying to and \"general DOJ business,\" spokesman Hogan Gidley said without elaboration. \"I didn't know Rod before, but I've gotten to know him,\" Trump said at the White House earlier. The Justice Department issued statements meant to deny the reporting, saying Rosenstein never pursued or authorized recording the president and did not believe there was a basis for invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, which would involve the Cabinet and vice president agreeing to remove him. And the remark about secretly recording the president was meant sarcastically, according to a statement the department issued from someone who it said was in the room. Even so, Rosenstein told White House officials that he was willing to resign and arrived at the White House a week and a half ago with the expectation that he would be fired. He met in person with White House chief of staff John Kelly and spoke by phone with Trump during a tumultuous day that ended with him still in his job. Rosenstein and Trump had been expected to meet at the White House days later, but that meeting was put off so that the president could focus on the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Trump had previously said that he would prefer not to fire the Justice Department's No. 2 official and that Rosenstein had told him he did not say the remarks attributed to him. Advisers had also cautioned Trump against doing anything dramatic in the weeks before the midterm elections next month. Kelly was present for Monday's conversation between Rosenstein and Trump, the White House said, as was Rosenstein's top deputy at the Justice Department, Ed O'Callaghan. The speculation over Rosenstein's future concerned Democrats, who feared that a dismissal could lead to Trump curtailing Mueller's probe. Although Trump has at times criticized his deputy attorney general, he has reserved his sharpest verbal attacks for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation in March 2017 because of his own earlier involvement with the Trump campaign. Both men will likely see their futures re-evaluated after the elections, Trump advisers have said. Besides the meeting with Trump, Rosenstein has also agreed to a private meeting with House Republicans who want to question him about his reported statements on the president.",

            "article_content": "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilians showed their disgust with corruption and rising crime in the first round of presidential voting, nearly giving an outright victory to a brash-speaking former army captain who has promised to restore \"traditional values,\" jail crooked politicians and give police a freer hand to shoot drug traffickers. But with far-right congressman Jair Bolsonaro getting 46 percent of the vote Sunday, short of the 50-plus percent he needed, voters also signaled they were not quite ready to make a final decision.  On Oct. 28, Bolsonaro will face second-place finisher Fernando Haddad in a runoff vote. Haddad, the Workers' Party standard-bearer who was appointed by jailed ex-President Luiz Inacio da Silva, got 29 percent in the first round, and polls have predicted a close race in the runoff. Bolsonaro was expected to come out in front on Sunday, but he far outperformed predictions, blazing past competitors with more financing, the institutional backing of traditional parties and much more free air time on television. The candidate from the tiny Social and Liberal Party made savvy use of Twitter and Facebook to spread his message that only he could end the corruption, crime and economic malaise that has seized Brazil in recent years -- and bring back the good old days and traditional values. His appeal to voters for a return to \"traditional values,\" his embrace of social media messaging as a way to communicate directly with the public, and his brash style have led to some Brazilian media dubbing him the \u00a0\"Trump of the Tropics.\" His rhetoric has shown stark parallels with U.S. President Donald Trump.  \"This is a victory for honest people who want the best for Brazil,\" said Bianca Santos, a 40-year-old psychologist who gathered outside a hotel where Bolsonaro was watching the returns. \"I believe he is the only one with a serious plan to end crime.\" For voters, Bolsonaro and Haddad represent starkly different visions for the future. Bolsonaro has promised to slash spending, privatize as much as possible in a country long heavy on state control and be a check on social movements that have gained much ground in recent years. Meanwhile, true to the Workers' Party's leftist roots, Haddad has promised to fight long-standing inequalities, scrap a major labor reform passed last year and invest more in education. Where Brazil's next leader takes the economy, the largest in Latin America, will have a large impact on surrounding countries that are trading partners with Brazil. The next leader will also have an influence on Venezuela, both diplomatically and practically, as thousands of Venezuelans have crossed Brazil's northern border. Bolsonaro has promised a harder line on Venezuela and other leftist regimes and closer ties with the United States. It's not clear what Bolsonaro would do to further isolate Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, but he once suggested creating camps for the Venezuelans who have fled the country's economic collapse. But much of his campaign focused on domestic issues. Bolsonaro has painted a nation in collapse, where drug traffickers and politicians steal with equal impunity, and moral rot has set in. He has advocated loosening gun ownership laws so individuals can fight off criminals, encouraging police to shoot more crooks and restoring \"traditional\" Brazilian values -- though some take issue with his definition of those values in light of his approving allusions to the country's 1964-1985 dictatorship and his derisive comments about women, blacks and gay people. Haddad, a former education minister, has also spent much time arguing that da Silva, his mentor, was unfairly jailed -- a strategy aimed at attracting voters who still feel strong affection for da Silva despite a corruption conviction. Workers' Party stalwarts are still fuming about the 2016 impeachment and removal from office of President Dilma Rousseff, da Silva's predecessor. Matthew Taylor, an associate professor of Latin American politics at American University, said that in the weeks before the runoff vote Bolsonaro will likely hit Haddad hard on the theme of corruption within the Workers' Party and da Silva, who Brazilians simply call Lula. \"Haddad has a huge albatross around his neck because of the corruption and all the rhetoric about the impeachment and Lula,\" said Taylor. \"Bolsonaro will hit back on that.\" Indeed, Bolsonaro already showed his ability to tap deep anger in Brazil with the traditional political class and \"throw the bums out\" rage after a massive corruption investigation revealed staggering levels of graft. Still, he alienated nearly as many people as he attracted with his offensive comments. And polling shows Bolsonaro will face a tight race with Haddad in the second round -- before Sunday's first round, polls showed a statistical dead heat in a potential second round. Many voters, already disillusioned with their democracy, said they felt trapped by the choice between the two front-runners, a sentiment likely to deepen in the weeks to come. \"I didn't like any of the candidates and I felt obliged to choose the lesser of two evils,\" said Frederico Vasconcellos, a 68-year-old retired metalworker. The Workers' Party \"managed to ruin the country with corruption and theft. ... So I decided to vote for Bolsonaro, who is the only one who can block the return of the Workers' Party.\" Though they come from opposite sides of the political spectrum, both Bolsonaro and Haddad ran campaigns based on nostalgia for a better time. Bolsonaro frequently evoked the country's military dictatorship amid promises of a return to traditional values and safer, simpler times. \"The country is on the brink of chaos,\" Bolsonaro said in a Facebook live after a second round was announced. \"We can't let the left advance even one more step.\" For his part, Haddad called on \"democrats\" to unite around his candidacy. In a broadside against Bolsonaro, who frequently talks about liberalizing gun laws, Haddad said: \"We don't carry guns. We carry the force of arguments to defend Brazil and its people.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump went after Democrats Saturday night at a rally in West Virginia, a state whose Democratic senator could be a crucial swing vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Mr. Trump targeted West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, calling him \"Washington Liberal Joe\" and linking him to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters.\u00a0 If Democrats are elected, Mr. Trump said, \"you'll have Venezuela, Big Version.\" Manchin is one of the Senate's most vulnerable Demoracts up for re-election this year. Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, meaning that they can only afford to lose one Republican vote to still be able to confirm Kavanaugh. Manchin voted to confirm Mr. Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and Republicans believe that he may be persuaded to vote for Kavanaugh as well. \u00a0 Democrats were the target of Mr. Trump's criticisms, with Mr. Trump referring to them as the \"party of crime.\" He said Democrats would \"open our nation's borders, starve our law enforcement officers.\"\u00a0 He also said he didn't want to call them the \"Democratic party\" because it sounded too nice. Mr. Trump said he prefers \"Democrat party.\" Mr. Trump suggested Sen. Dianne Feinstein leaked sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, although Feinstein said on Thursday that she and her staff did not leak the allegations. Mr. Trump conceded \"maybe\" it didn't come from Feinstein, but \"that was the worst body language I've ever seen.\" Mr. Trump called out New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker, the former mayor of Newark. Claiming Booker \"ran Newark into the ground,\" Mr. Trump said \"now he wants to be president.\" Mr. Trump said he \"dreams of these guys\" being in the race. Mr. Trump did not just focus on Washington politics, he also promoted his foreign policy. He criticized the Iran nuclear deal and he praised his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. As for Kim, Mr. Trump said \"I was really being tough and so was he. And we would go back and forth. And then we fell in love. No really. He wrote me beautiful letters. They were great letters. And then we fell in love.\" While promoting his trade deals, Mr. Trump said \"we reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of -- let's put it his way -- we love our country.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump insisted a vote for Republican senate nominee Patrick Morrissey is a \"vote for me.\"\u00a0 While Mr. Trump normally walks out at his rally to Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the U.S.A.,\" he walked out to Lee Greenwood's \"Country Roads\" instead, which mentions West Virginia.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's visit to West Virginia comes after a turbulent week in Washington. The  to the full Senate 11-10 on Friday, but with a condition first suggested by Sen. Jeff Flake, that the floor vote be delayed a week to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.\u00a0 Mr. Trump instructed the FBI to open an investigation later on Friday. CBS News confirmed that the FBI was reaching out to the second woman to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, Deborah Ramirez, on Saturday. Mr. Trump has strongly defended Kavanaugh against all allegations, and told reporters on Friday that he had not considered withdrawing Kavanaugh's nomination. Later on Friday evening, he tweeted his support for Kavanaugh after calling for the FBI investigation. \"Just started, tonight, our 7th FBI investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He will someday be recognized as a truly great Justice of The United States Supreme Court!\" Mr. Trump wrote. Just started, tonight, our 7th FBI investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He will someday be recognized as a truly great Justice of The United States Supreme Court! Manchin might feel pressured by constituents in West Virginia to approve Kavanaugh. West Virginia voted for Mr. Trump by 40 points in 2016, and every other member of the state's congressional delegation is Republican. Mr. Trump is still deeply popular in the state, and Manchin might not want to risk the ire of voters by voting against the president's Supreme Court nominee. Mr. Trump has given several campaign rallies in recent months, including one in West Virginia in August. In each of these rallies, he tells audiences that the Democrats will never vote for his Supreme Court picks. This could be a potent argument for Republicans to turn out for Manchin's opponent, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.

President Trump visited Ohio in August to campaign speak at a rally for DeWine. On Thursday night, Obama blasted President Trump and the Republican Party under him, saying as he has before that they are appealing to lesser instincts.\u00a0 \"They appeal to our tribal instincts. They appeal to fear,\" Obama said of the GOP. \"They try to pit one against another. They try and say border security, we'll keep out those folks who don't look like us or sound like us. That's a playbook as old as time.\" Republican Gov. John Kasich is term-limited, and Democrats, who are currently out of power at every level of Ohio government, hope to win the governorship. The appearance is part of a swing across the country by Obama to boost Democrats' efforts to win House seats and state elections. Obama kicked off his midterm campaigning earlier this month with a speech at University of Illinois at Urbana Champlain. In this speech, he urged people to become active, saying \"you need to vote because our democracy depends on it.\" He also decried the Republican Party, saying that Mr. Trump was a \"symptom, but not the cause\" of extreme partisanship in the country. Obama's second campaign appearance was at a rally in Anaheim, California, on Saturday in support of seven Democratic congressional candidates in largely Republican Orange County. He spoke for a much briefer period than in his address the previous day. \"They stepped up, they're fired up, they're ready to go,\" Obama said about the candidates, repeating a campaign slogan from his 2008 campaign. Obama released a video last week outlining his case for the midterms.\u00a0 \"We're in an urgent time. We've seen basic norms and principles that have served us well for decades increasingly violated, not to mention policies that have skewed towards the wealthy and powerful,\" Obama said in the video.\u00a0",

But you think about the Democratic Party moving farther and farther to the left \u2014 our country is center-right or center-left. It's not on the extremes,\" Kasich said on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. He said the Republican Party is in a \"tug of war\" but ultimately \"worth fighting for.\" \u00a0   Kasich, who attended the memorial service for McCain on Saturday, said the late GOP senator was trying to send a message with the highly orchestrated series of events after his death. \"Come together. Have guts. Stand up,\" Kasich said. \"Leaders walk a lonely road. And John did not like people that did this \u2014 put their finger in the air and get the wind. He was so comfortable with himself. And it really didn't matter to him who he was going to have to take on or what cause he was going to go for.\" Kasich declined to identify a political figure in the mold of McCain who could \"engage in a bit of poetry\" and unite the country. But he said McCain's political style marked a sharp contrast with President Trump, with whom he's frequently sparred over a range of issues.\u00a0   \"I will tell you, family separation is not American value at the border. It isn't. The idea we're going to deport these people, that's not to me an American value,\" Kasich said. \"Ringing up massive debt. We like the tax cut, but there was no tax reform. It was a problem. And trying to strip health care away from 20 million Americans.\" But Kasich added his belief that political parties \"shouldn't matter so much\" and voters should instead \"vote for the person\" in the upcoming midterm elections. Kasich, who lost the GOP nomination in 2016, declined to say whether he's eying another shot at the presidency, but said he's going to do his \"level best\" to save the Republican Party and would campaign for Ohio congressional candidate Troy Balderson.\u00a0 \"But at the end I worry about my country,\" he conceded. \"I worry about my country being a great leader in the world, not more conflict which can lead to \u2014 let's not even go there. I want my country, where the people that live in this country, whoever they are, to feel as though they have a hope, they're respected and they can be successful. That to me is what it is really all about.\" Kasich said while he supports his party in the midterms, there are a number of Republicans he called \"dividers\" who he will not be campaigning for. \"I just won't do it, because if you're a divider and if you can't see the fact that we need to unify people then I can't be for you. I mean, nothing personal. I just can't help you,\" he said. The Ohio governor also revealed what he was thinking when he knelt before McCain's coffin as it lied in state in the U.S. Capitol on Friday. \"Well, I had a word with John. I said, 'John, you remember I called you when you were sick and I asked you if you were OK with the big guy?' And I said, 'John, I'll see you up there someday. Keep the place open for me, would you?' And I got up and left,\" Kasich remembered. Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

John is absolutely top of the line & has my Complete & Total Endorsement! Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is also running for reelection. She is being challenged in the Tuesday's Republican primary by Rod Miller, a rancher. \u00a0 As in Wyoming, the Republican gubernatorial primary is a race to watch, with former state Sen. Mike Dunleavy and Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell battling for the GOP nomination. Darin Colbry, Thomas Gordon, Gerald Heikes, Merica Hlatcu and Michael Sheldon are also running for the Republican nod.\u00a0 The winner is likely to face incumbent Gov. Bill Walker, an independent who is running for reelection, and former Sen. Mark Begich, who is the sole Democratic candidate. Some Democrats worry that Walker and Begich could divide the liberal vote, which would assist Republican chances in November.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Democrats will also choose their nominee to face Republican Rep. Don Young, the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives, in November. The 85-year-old Young is the state's only House member.\u00a0 One of Young's possible challengers, Carol Hafner, doesn't live in Alaska and has never been to the\u00a0state. She is campaigning for the seat online against challengers Dimitri Shein and Alyse Gavin. Gavin is well-known for her work in advocating for more education funding. Shein is an advocate for Medicare-for-All. Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Retired Marine Lt. Col. Amy McGrath, who is the Democratic candidate running in Kentucky's 6th Congressional District, released her third television ad Friday for the general election, a spot that portrays her military background as the precursor of her run for office to fight corruption. CBS News rates this race as competitive. Here's the ad: In the ad, McGrath, who was the first woman Marine to fly a combat mission in an F-18, is running against incumbent Rep. Andy Barr, R-Kentucky, says that people advised against her running for office. \"People told me I shouldn't,\" McGrath said in the ad. \"That politics was too ugly and corrupt. But I decided that if I was able to risk my life for our country multiple times in combat that I had to have the courage to come home and fight for my country here.\" The release of the ad comes days after Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, and his wife were indicted for misusing campaign funds for their personal items and weeks after Rep. Chris Collins, R-New York, was indicted on insider trading charges. Hunter and Collins were the first two congressional Republicans to endorse then-candidate Donald Trump for president. McGrath's ad was also released during the same week a jury found former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort guilty on eight counts of financial fraud and the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts, including tax evasion and campaign finance violations. Mark Nickolas, Amy McGrath's campaign manager, said Putnam Partners, a political media consulting firm, shot the ad several weeks ago. Her campaign is spending $120,000 over the next nine days to run the ad. In the ad, McGrath also laments that the American people have lost their faith in government. \"Not only are we not proud of our political system we are completely disgusted by it,\" McGrath said. In a Facebook\u00a0post\u00a0Friday morning, McGrath addressed eight attacks ads from her opponent, Republican Andy Barr and from GOP super PACs. In it, she talked about the values the Marine Corps instilled in her and her campaign. \"When I entered this race, I pledged to be a different kind of candidate and eight desperate attack ads aren't going to turn me into what we have come to loathe,\" McGrath wrote. \"I refuse to win at any cost. And I will place my faith in the voters to see through all this trash.\" Jodi Whitaker, Barr's campaign communications director, said in statement provided to CBS News that McGrath is \"trying to fool Kentucky voters.\" \"She wants to take away your tax cuts, supports abortion on demand, twice voted for Obama whose policies threw Kentuckians out of work, supports open borders and calls a border wall 'stupid,' and will be another vote for Nancy Pelosi's liberal agenda,\" Whitaker said in the statement. \"That's the real Amy McGrath.\" CBS News reporter covering the Senate.",

            "article_content": "President Trump took credit Wednesday for a Republican win in a special election in Ohio's 12th Congressional District. Troy Balderson has claimed victory, but officially, the race is too close to call \u2014 and maybe too close for comfort for the GOP. \"When you do the math and look at tradition it's not going to change,\" Balderson said Wednesday.\u00a0 With roughly 8,000 absentee ballots and provisional votes yet to be counted, Balderson is barely leading Democrat Danny O'Connor by less than 1 percentage point. The margin is far narrower than usual in this District, which has been considered reliably conservative \u2014 and that has some Republicans worried.  John Kasich, Ohio's outgoing Republican governor, said voters sent a message to Republicans to \"knock it off.\" \"Stop the chaos, the division,  no more of this family separation that we see at the border or taking people's health care away,\" Kasich said. \"People have basically had enough.\" But President Trump doesn't seemed worried. On Twitter, he said his endorsement gave Balderson a boost and predicted a \"red wave\" in November. O'Connor disagrees. He'll face Balderson in a rematch for the seat in the general election this fall. He told CBS News he has \"three more months\" to find more people to vote for him in November. \"We just showed that if you give us three months to sprint across this district what we can do.\"\u00a0 There are dozens of districts around the country that look like Ohio's 12th \u2014 traditionally Republican areas in the shadows of big cities where working-class people and retirees are fed up with Washington. Control of the House will likely be determined by which party can win over voters like Angie Wright.  \"I truly don't trust any of them any more,\" Wright said. \"They don't keep promises. I don't see anything happening for the middle class.\" The closer-than-anticipated finish led a key outside Republican group to warn GOP Congressional candidates that they face a \"tough political environment\" and \"cannot expect to win tough races\" if their Democratic opponent is raising more money.",

            "article_content": "\u00a0A measure that would divide California into three parts won't appear on the November ballot, the state Supreme Court decided Wednesday, marking the latest defeat for a long-shot push to reimagine the nation's most populous state. The justices ordered the secretary of state not to put the ballot initiative before voters, saying significant questions have been raised about its validity. The court now will consider a challenge from the Planning and Conservation League, an environmental group that argued splitting up California would drastically change its government structure beyond what can be accomplished through a simple ballot initiative. \"We conclude that the potential harm in permitting the measure to remain on the ballot outweighs the potential harm in delaying the proposition to a future election,\" the justices wrote in a unanimous ruling. They said time constraints forced them to rule on the issue immediately. Venture capitalist Tim Draper, who spent more than $1.7 million on his \"Cal 3\" initiative, has tried for years to split the state, arguing it has become ungovernable because of its size, wealth disparities and geographic diversity. His last attempt to divide California in six didn't gather enough signatures to make the ballot in 2016. \"The whole point of the initiative process was to be set up as a protection from a government that was no longer representing its people. Now that protection has been corrupted,\" Draper said in a statement. \"Whether you agree or not with this initiative, this is not the way democracies are supposed to work.\" The director of the Planning and Conservation League cheered the ruling. The initiative \"was a costly, flawed scheme that will waste billions of California taxpayer dollars, create chaos in public services including safeguarding our environment,\" Howard Penn said in a statement. \"It would have dismantled the world's fifth biggest economy without solving a single challenge facing Californians today.\" The environmental group's lawsuit says major changes to the state's government structure require approval from two-thirds of the Legislature before being considered by voters or a state constitutional convention. Draper has argued that the measure doesn't go beyond what voters can enact through an initiative. If passed, it would be only the first step toward splitting the state, he said. The initiative, which could appear on a future ballot if the court ultimately rules in its favor, seeks to divide the state into Northern California, California and Southern California. Northern California would comprise the Bay Area, Silicon Valley, Sacramento and counties north of the state capital. California would be a strip of land along the coast stretching from Los Angeles to Monterey. Southern California would include Fresno and the surrounding farming communities, reaching to San Diego and the Mexican border. Supporters gathered signatures from hundreds of thousands of Californians, and the secretary of state in June announced they had enough to get the effort on the general election ballot. The justices' decision leaves 11 ballot measures for voters to weigh in November.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Martha Roby is seeking Republican redemption in an Alabama runoff election that hinges on her loyalty to President Donald Trump. Roby is facing Democrat-turned-Trump Republican Bobby Bright on Tuesday, trying not to become the third congressional Republican to lose her job this primary season. From the outside, the race shouldn't be close. Roby is a four-term incumbent in deep-red Alabama. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have endorsed her. And her Republican opponent supported Nancy Pelosi when he served as a Democrat in Congress. But as is often the case in the Trump era, the conventional rules of politics do not apply. Roby's political survival depends on whether Alabama voters are sufficiently convinced that she's made amends for turning her back on Trump in 2016 after he was caught bragging about sexually predatory behavior in the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape. The remarks, she said at the time, made Trump \"unacceptable\" as a Republican candidate for president. She's spent much of the last two years trying to convince her red-state constituents in Alabama's 2nd Congressional District that she is a reliable vote for the administration. Roby failed to convince a majority of Republican primary voters back in June, earning just 39 percent of the vote in the first primary contest, which forced a runoff against the second-place vote getter. Despite her past criticism, the Trump White House has emerged as Roby's most powerful backer. Trump himself endorsed Roby on Twitter, calling her a \"reliable vote for our Make America Great Again Agenda\" and bashing Bright as \"a recent Nancy Pelosi voting Democrat.\" Vice President Mike Pence recorded automated calls for Roby distributed to district voters beginning on Saturday. He calls Roby a reliable vote for the Trump agenda and urged voters to send her back to Congress. \"We can always count on her vote,\" Pence says in the call. Armed with an endorsement from Trump, Roby has argued that she's \"a conservative Republican with a proven record.\" \"I've worked with the administration to get conservative policies across the finish line. My opponent voted for Nancy Pelosi to be speaker,\" Roby said during a campaign stop at a south Alabama lumber company. She also touted her support for a border wall and opposition to abortion. Bright, who represented the district for two years as a Democrat, argues that he's more conservative than Roby, whom he calls an establishment Republican who hasn't \"stayed connected\" with the heavily agrarian and military district. \"I'm not an elitist. I'm not what they refer to as a blue blood. I'm a populist. I talk with the people and so does (Trump),\" said Bright, the 13th of 14 children born into a sharecropping family. Roby has enjoyed a 5-to-1 fundraising advantage over Bright. She's used the arsenal to hammer Bright in television ads over his Democratic background \u2014 particularly his 2009 vote for Pelosi as House speaker. A mailer distributed by Roby's campaign promotes Trump's endorsement and lists Pelosi's name five times in attacking Bright. While many Washington Republicans expect Roby to win on Tuesday, the anticipated low turnout in the midsummer affair offers an air of unpredictability. Less than 20 percent of eligible voters are expected to participate.",

Liberals fear President Trump's choice to replace the long standing swing vote in the nation's highest court will unleash a wave of conservative decisions, undoing landmark case law many assumed was long-settled. But, Democrats have few options in the Senate to oppose it. On Capitol Hill, almost 600 demonstrators were arrested Thursday in a protest of the Trump administration's so-called zero tolerance policy, treating illegal border crossings as criminal offenses.  More demonstrations are expected this weekend, the latest in a wave of progressive energy that Democrats hope will translate to wins at the ballot box this fall. But some in the party's leadership fear it may also lead to upsets of their own incumbents, in the vein of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's primary victory over Rep. Joe Crowley in New York.  Also this week, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein fought back criticism from House Republicans over the Justice Department's response to oversight requests. And after announcing this week that he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 16, the president caught grief over a tweet attacking \"now disgraced FBI agents,\" insisting \"Russia had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election.\"  On Friday, President Trump addressed the shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis that gunned down five victims. Speaking from the White House, the president pledged to do \"everything in our power to reduce violent crime and to protect innocent life.\"  And on Sunday, Mexico will go to the polls in an election that could radically shift the nation's direction and its relationship to the United States, by electing populist Andrews Manuel Lopez Obrador. If elected, the leftist former mayor could serve to further complicate already tense trade talks with Mexico and other U.S. allies furious with the president's tariffs.

            "article_content": "GENEVA -- The U.N.'s migration agency snubbed the Trump administration's candidate to lead it on Friday, a major blow to U.S. leadership of a body addressing one of the world's most pressing issues - and only the second time that it won't be run by an American since 1951. Diplomats who took part in the first three rounds of voting Friday told the Associated Press that American Ken Isaacs was eliminated in the ongoing contest to elect the next director-general of the International Organization of Migration.\u00a0 The race was so far led by Antonio Vitorino, a Portuguese Socialist, ahead of IOM deputy director-general Laura Thompson of Costa Rica. U.N. migration officials are distressed by U.S. policy and sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump's candidate did not stand a chance, reports CBS New' Pamela Falk.\u00a0 In addition, as a former Portuguese politician, Vitorino has a good relationship with the secretary general and will move the global compact on migration forward, Falk reports.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The move marks a searing rejection of the U.S. candidate just as the Trump administration has been retreating from or rebuffing international institutions - including two others based in Geneva: Earlier this month, the United States pulled out of the U.N.'s Human Rights Council, and Mr. Trump has recently criticized the World Trade Organization as \"unfair\" to the U.S. \"Yet another sign that US power, authority and prestige has been so dramatically diminished,\" tweeted Keith Harper, who was the Obama administration's ambassador to the rights council. The \"IOM Director is seen as an 'American seat' and Mr. Trump was unable to place an American in it.\" Isaacs' candidacy had been clouded by U.S. policies like travel bans and migrant family separations - and his own comments that critics have called anti-Muslim. But few diplomats streaming out of a Geneva conference center dared to offer an explanation about how an American was stripped of a post that the U.S. has held a lock-hold on for decades. One, Senegalese diplomat Youssoupha Ndiaye, simply spoke of the early result: \"The American is out.\" Two other diplomats confirmed that, as well as the two-person race remaining between Vitorino and Thompson, as delegates broke for lunch. The two spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to release the information publicly. The winner, who will be determined by dues-paying, ballot-casting members among the 172 countries in the IOM, will succeed longtime U.S. diplomat William Lacy Swing, who leaves in September. IOM officials declined to confirm the result until voting was finished. An intergovernmental body that became a U.N.-related agency in 2016, IOM has had only one director-general who wasn't American since its creation 67 years ago. But Mark Hetfield, a self-described friend of Isaacs who heads the humanitarian group HIAS, which works with IOM, put the blame on policies and invective from the man in the White House - not the candidate for the U.N. migration agency job. \"This IOM election really was not about Ken Isaacs, for whom I have a lot of respect as a humanitarian,\" Hetfield said. \"The election was an international referendum rejecting President Trump and his xenophobic, Islamophobic and isolationist policies.\u00a0 Let's face it, Isaacs' tweets were no worse than the ones coming out of the White House.\" The administration is fresh off major international scorn over the separation of migrant families coming across the Mexico border. The U.S. Supreme Court has also upheld his ban on U.S. travel for citizens of a number of countries, most of them predominantly Muslim. Trump has also yanked the United States out of the Global Compact for Migration. Even before that, Isaacs was on the defensive over retweets and other comments that some critics viewed as anti-Muslim, so much so that he shut down his Twitter account. After that Isaacs carefully stage-managed his media appearances and kept to script - with State Department handlers advising him or in tow. Playing in Isaacs' favor along with tradition, however, was money: The United States is the single biggest donor to the IOM, followed closely by the European Union.",

            "article_content": "Diving into the midterm elections, President Donald Trump is seeking to build a stable of Republicans who will help promote his agenda and serve as a check on Democrats aiming to win majorities in Congress. Mr. Trump is traveling to Nashville, Tennessee, on Tuesday to raise campaign cash for Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the party's leading U.S. Senate hopeful in Tennessee, and headline a rally with his most loyal supporters. Blackburn is expected to face Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen to replace Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who is retiring. The Tennessee campaign is among several races crucial to Trump's plans to maintain control of the Senate, where Republicans are defending a narrow two-seat majority. Mr. Trump is planning a series of political rallies and events in the coming months to boost Republicans and brand Democrats as obstructionists to his agenda. The president held a similar rally in Indiana earlier this month, appearing with Republican businessman Mike Braun and ripping Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly as a \"swamp person\" who refused to aid the GOP agenda. \"We're not getting complacent. We can't,\" Trump said in Elkhart, Indiana. \"If we elect more Republicans we can truly deliver for all of our citizens.\" Beyond Indiana, Mr. Trump has used his Twitter page to boost California Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox, hoping to strengthen the party's chances of securing a spot on the ballot in November. He has also set his sights on Montana, where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is seeking re-election in a state Trump carried in a landslide. The two states have primaries on June 5. The president is raising money later in the week in Texas to benefit Senate Republicans and his 2020 campaign. Tennessee has a history of electing centrist senators and the race could be complicated by Corker's up-and-down relationship with Trump. Corker once said Mr. Trump had turned the White House into an \"adult day care center\" and the president tweeted that Corker \"couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee.\" Yet Corker was in the Oval Office on Saturday, receiving praise from the president for his help in securing the release of a man imprisoned in Venezuela. The breakthrough happened after Corker held a surprise meeting in Caracas with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. In his final year in the Senate, Corker has called Bredesen a friend and said he won't actively campaign against him. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, offered an early endorsement of Blackburn in April, calling her on Twitter \"a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her. Great on the Military, Border Security and Crime.\" Blackburn, who served on Trump's transition team, has embraced the president and called herself a \"hardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.\" Bredesen, who is attempting to become the first Democrat to win a Senate campaign in Tennessee since Al Gore in 1990, has aired TV ads in which he says that he's \"not running against Donald Trump\" and that he learned long ago to \"separate the message from the messenger.\"",

Claire McCaskill in the U.S. Senate said he expects to come home to a home-cooked meal from his his fianc\u00e9e at 6 p.m. every night, and plans for his future daughters to do the same.\u00a0 Courtland Sykes on Tuesday took to Facebook to repost comments he wrote last year, to clear up his views on women's rights.\u00a0 \"In light of recent questions regarding my views on Women's Rights, attached is my full statement,\" he posted on his verified \"Courtland Sykes for Senate\" Facebook page. On whether he favors women's rights, Sykes said his fianc\u00e9e, Chanel Rion, has given him orders to favor them, \"so I'd better.\" \"But Chanel knows that my obedience comes with a small price that she loves to pay anyway: I want to come home to a home-cooked dinner at six every night, one that she fixes and one that I expect one day to have daughters learn to fix after they become traditional homemakers and family wives \u2014 think Norman Rockwell here and Gloria Steinem be damned,\" he said in the post.\u00a0 The comments were apparently a part of an 11-page statement he sent to the St. Louis Dispatch last year. Sykes, who filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on Sept. 26, 2017, has crafted a Trump-style message on border security and building a strong military. According to the St. Louis-Dispatch, as of October, he had been a Missouri resident for less than a year. Sykes, despite saying he was in the U.S. Navy, \"struggled to answer questions about when the United States should exercise military force,\" in an interview, according to the newspaper. Sykes then declined a second interview, instead sending the 11-page document outlining his positions, including his position on women's rights. Sykes is far from the leading GOP candidate \u2014 he isn't even backed by President Trump, whose values Sykes claims to espouse. Mr. Trump has casually endorsed Missouri's GOP Attorney General Josh Hawley, the favored Republican in the race.\u00a0 Sykes' reposted comments on women's rights continue, \"I don't buy into radical feminism's crazed definition of modern womanhood and I never did. They don't own that definition \u2014 and never did. They made it up to suit their own nasty, snake-filled heads. Modern women can BE anything they want, including traditional women \u2014 as millions are and millions are fast becoming. Millennial women voters despised Hillary (Clinton) and cost her the election (and they weren't Russians). I wonder why they despise her? One reason is they look at her life's personal wreckage and din't want to become like her.\" In the Facebook post, Sykes also describes how he wants any future daughters of his own to grow up \u2014 to work at home, not to grow up into \"career-obsessed banshees.\" \"I want daughters to have their own intelligence, their own dignity, their own workspace and their own degrees; I want them to build home-based enterprises and live in homes shared with good husbands and I don't want them to grew up into career-obsessed banshees who forgo home life and children and the happiness of family to become nail-biting, manophonic, hell-bent feminist she devils who shriek from the tops of a thousand tall buildings they are think they could have leaped over in a single bound \u2014 had men not 'suppressing them.' It's just nuts. It always was.\" Sykes' concludes by saying he supports women's' rights, but not the kind \"mean-spirited radical feminists\" support.\u00a0 His opinions on Clinton and McCaskill \u2014 are quite clear. In another recent Facebook post, Sykes posted images of female Democrats \u2014 including Clinton, McCaskill and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., \u2014 alongside famous Disney villains.\u00a0 \"Democrats dressing for the jobs they want,\" he posted Sunday.

            "article_content": "LONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Theresa May has survived a challenge to her leadership from European Union skeptics in her own party over her handling of the Brexit process. A majority of May's fellow Conservatives backed her in a secret no-confidence ballot held Wednesday night for her to stay in office. The result was a defeat for the most ardent Brexit backers within the Conservative, or Tory, party, but it does little to clarify Britain's path forward in its convoluted divorce proceedings with Europe. May needed at least 158 Tories to back her leadership in the vote, and the head of the party's committee governing leadership challenges announced Wednesday night that she had met that threshold. She has vowed to keep fighting to get the agreement she hashed out with the other 27 members of the EU, laying out the proposed terms of the divorce, approved by the British Parliament, but she still faces an uphill battle. Having survived the no-confidence vote, May's hard-line \"Brexiteer\" foes in the Conservative Party cannot challenge her leadership again for a year. In a concession to her own Tory colleagues disillusioned by her handling of the negotiations with Europe, she has said she will not seek to represent the party in the next scheduled national elections in 2022. But she still has to convince not only fellow Conservatives, but a majority of all Members of Parliament that the roughly 500-page deal her government negotiated with Europe is the safest option for Britain. She has just weeks to squeeze any further concessions out of the other 27 EU member states, and they have already warned there is \"no room whatsoever for renegotiation\" of the draft agreement.  EU leaders have suggested they may still be willing to \"clarify\" the terms of the deal, but the basics, as far as Brussels is concerned, have been hashed out.  If May cannot get a draft agreement that appeals to enough British lawmakers for them to approve it, as things stand now the default alternative is the much-maligned prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Deal or no deal, unless the British government formally withdraws its notification to the EU of its intent to leave the union, Britain will be out on March 29. Very few consider that a good option.  Economists and politicians of all stripes, including the U.K. government's own experts, have warned that it could spark a recession in Britain and cripple the vital cross-border flow of goods and people. With more than four decades of common laws, rules, regulations and standards suddenly thrown out the window, Britain would suddenly have to negotiate new, unilateral trade deals with other countries guided only by broad World Trade Organization rules.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 At least five Democrats who have pledged to oppose Nancy Pelosi in her bid to become speaker of the House are nearing a deal to support her as long as she limits her leadership to no more than four more years, according to multiple people familiar with the talks. Reps. Ed Perlmutter, D-California, Linda Sanchez, D-California, and Bill Foster, D-Illinois, met with Pelosi on Tuesday about the potential agreement, which is still not finalized. Full details of emerging agreement were not immediately available, but the talks are designed to find Pelosi enough votes to comfortably win the speakership in a Jan. 3 vote on the floor of the House and for holdouts concerned about another open-ended speakership to extract concessions from her. The other Democrats who are open to supporting Pelosi if the deal is finalized include Filemon Vela of Texas and Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who have been vocal critics of her continued leadership. Under the agreement, Pelosi would lead her caucus for no more than four years \u2014 two years now and another two years after that if she receives the support of two-thirds of the caucus, according to a source familiar with the deal. Pelosi would also abide by the agreement even if the caucus does not vote to implement it, according to a source familiar with the talks. \"There are various conversations going on about a path forward,\" said an aide to Pelosi. \"Progress has been made and the conversations are constructive because all involved care about the institution of the House of Representatives.\" News of the talks were was first reported by Politico. Word of an emerging agreement came on an already busy day for Pelosi, who sparred with President Trump over a potential partial government shutdown in an unprecedented televised exchange in the Oval Office. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-New York, urged Trump to accept a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that would provide continued funding for border security, but at levels far below his $5 billion request for continued construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Pelosi easily won a majority of support in Democratic caucus elections last month by a vote of 203 to 32 with four blank or \"present\" votes. Since then, one person who voted against her in caucus, Massachusetts Rep. Stephen Lynch, announced he would support her because she promised the new Congress would represent the priorities of average working families. She still needs to win over 17 more Democrats to secure the job in January. Four members who voted for her in caucus are from territories that do not have a vote on the House floor. The anti-Pelosi faction includes incumbents who have called for her to step aside and newly-elected members who called for new leadership during their campaigns, often under pressure from a barrage of negative advertising by Republicans. Not everyone who opposes her has confirmed they support the four-year deal. The current trio of Democratic leaders \u2014 Pelosi, 78, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, 79, of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn, 78, of South Carolina \u2014 have all sat atop the party for more than a decade. The deal being negotiated by the rebel group would limit Hoyer and Clyburn's tenure as well. All have resisted the idea of stepping aside before having another chance to lead the Democrats in the majority, a chance they have not had since losing the House in 2010. During a roundtable with reporters Tuesday, Hoyer chafed at reports Pelosi was trying to negotiate term limits for the top team. \"I am against term limits because I have a term limit. It's a two-year term limit. And every year, the citizens that I represent and the members in this House have to re-up my contract,\" he said. \"She's not negotiating for me,\" he added.\u00a0",

Avenatti rose to fame this year representing porn actress Stormy Daniels, who alleged in her\u00a0unsuccessful defamation suit\u00a0against the president that she had an affair with President Trump a decade ago. Avenatti capitalized on his newfound political currency by representing migrant families separated at the border and also a woman who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Avenatti, who is known for his broadsides against Mr. Trump on Twitter and cable news, had considered a presidential bid in recent months, even visiting early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire. He told the Des Moines Register in August he was \"exploring a run\" for president. In October, Avenatti faced criticism when Time Magazine quoted him as having said the Democratic nominee for president \"better be a white male.\" He said on Twitter he decided not to run for president \"after consultation with my family and at their request,\" adding \"but for their concerns I would run.\" Please see my statement below regarding 2020. pic.twitter.com/ztCfZUY6hA \"I remain concerned that the Democratic Party will move toward nominating an individual who might make an exceptional President but has no chance of actually beating Donald Trump,\" Avenatti said. \"We will not prevail in 2020 without a fighter.\" Avenatti had previously argued he was qualified to challenge Mr. Trump because of his similarities to the president. As he said in one interview in September on CNN, he is a \"real fighter,\" and he noted people who see him on TV think he's \"just like Trump but on the Democratic side.\" Avenatti was arrested on suspicion of domestic assault in November.

            "article_content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Misinformation, as opposed to disinformation, was chosen Monday as Dictionary.com's word of the year on the tattered coattails of \"toxic,\" picked earlier this month for the same honor by Oxford Dictionaries in these tumultuous times. Jane Solomon, a linguist-in-residence at Dictionary, said in a recent interview that her site's choice of \"mis\" over \"dis\" was deliberate, intended to serve as a \"call to action\" to be vigilant in the battle against fake news, flat earthers and anti-vaxxers, among other conduits. It's the idea of intent, whether to inadvertently mislead or to do it on purpose, that the Oakland, California-based company wanted to highlight. The company decided it would go high when others have spent much of 2018 going low. \"The rampant spread of misinformation is really providing new challenges for navigating life in 2018,\" Solomon told The Associated Press ahead of the word of the year announcement. \"Misinformation has been around for a long time, but over the last decade or so the rise of social media has really, really changed how information is shared. We believe that understanding the concept of misinformation is vital to identifying misinformation as we encounter it in the wild, and that could ultimately help curb its impact.\" In studying lookups on the site that trended this year, Dictionary noticed \"our relationship with truth is something that came up again and again,\" she said. Our #WordOfTheYear2018 isn't just any word. It's a call to action. We'll be sharing the tools to fight #misinformation all day today. First up: The Annenberg Public Policy Center: @factcheckdotorg. https://t.co/g928wHdtdU For example, the word \"mainstream\" popped up a lot, spiking in January as the term \"mainstream media,\" or MSM, grew to gargantuan proportions, wielded as an insult by some on the political right. Other words swirling around the same problem included a lookup surge in February for \"white lie\"\u00a0after Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, admitted to telling a few for President Trump. The word \"Orwellian\" surfaced in heavy lookups in May, after a statement attributed to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders accused the Chinese government of \"Orwellian nonsense\" in trying to impose its views on American citizens and private companies when it declared that United Airlines, American Airlines and other foreign carriers should refer to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as part of China in public-facing materials, such as their websites. Misinformation, Solomon said, \"frames what we've all been through in the last 12 months.\" In that vein, the site with 90 million monthly users has busied itself adding new word entries for \"filter bubble,\"\u00a0\"fake news,\" \"post-fact,\" \"post-truth\" and \"homophily,\" among others. Other word entries on the site have been freshened to reflect timely new meanings, including \"echo chamber.\" The company's runners-up for the top honor include \"representation,\" driven by the popularity of the movies \"Black Panther\" and \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" along with wins during the U.S. midterm elections for Muslim women, Native Americans and LGBTQ candidates. But the rise of misinformation, Solomon said, stretches well beyond U.S. borders and Facebook's role in disseminating fake news and propaganda in the\u00a0Cambridge Analytica scandal. The use of Facebook and other social media to incite violence and conflict was documented around the globe in 2018, she said. \"Hate speech and rumors posted to Facebook facilitated violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, riots started in Sri Lanka after false news set the country's Buddhist majority against Muslims, and false rumors about child kidnappers on WhatsApp led to mob violence in India,\" Solomon said. Is disinformation or misinformation at play in terms of the year's most prominent conspiracy theories? Solomon noted proliferation on social media over students in the Parkland school shooting being crisis actors instead of victims of violence, and over a group of migrants from Honduras who are making their way north being funded by \"rich liberals.\" Elsewhere in the culture, countless podcasts and videos have spread the absurd notion of a global cover-up that the Earth is flat rather than round. The idea of \"misinfodemics\" has surfaced in the last several years to identify the anti-vaccination movement and other beliefs that lead to real-world health crises, Solomon said. There are distinctions between misinformation and disinformation to be emphasized. \"Disinformation would have also been a really, really interesting word of the year this year, but our choice of misinformation was very intentional,\" she said. \"Disinformation is a word that kind of looks externally to examine the behavior of others. It's sort of like pointing at behavior and saying, 'THIS is disinformation.' With misinformation, there is still some of that pointing, but also it can look more internally to help us evaluate our own behavior, which is really, really important in the fight against misinformation. It's a word of self-reflection, and in that it can be a call to action. You can still be a good person with no nefarious agenda and still spread misinformation.\" She pointed to \"Poe's law\" in slicing and dicing \"misinfo\" and \"disinfo.\" The term, dating to 2005, has become an internet shorthand to sum up how easy it is to spread satire as truth online when an author's intent isn't clearly indicated. The phrase is based on a comment one Nathan Poe posted on a Christian forum during a discussion over creationism, in which he commented: \"Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is uttrerly (sic) impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone (italics used) won't mistake for the genuine article.\" Dictionary.com chose \"complicit\" as last year's word of the year. In 2016, it was \"xenophobia.\"",

Latino participation surged 174 percent in 2018, compared to the 2014 midterms, according to Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Participation by African-Americans jumped 157 percent. \"Latino voters played a pivotal role in taking back the House,\" Lujan told reporters during a conference call organized by the political action committee Latino Victory. \"Evidence is clear: Early and active and robust outreach to communities of color \u2014 in this case, into the Hispanic community \u2014 clearly pays off.\" Lujan, the first Hispanic to head the committee, said the effort included an investment of at least $21 million in Latino candidates. His office also launched the first multi-state Spanish-language TV ad the final week before the election. Lujan is currently vying for the post of Assistant Democratic Leader when Democrats gain the majority in the House next year. The Democrats targeted 111 Republican House congressional districts, 29 of which had at least a 10 percent Hispanic electorate. Dan Sena, the DCCC executive director, said the polling company Latino Decisions conducted nationwide focus groups to better identify the needs of Latino voters and tailor a message. \"What we wanted was a real, organic way to engage Latino voters and Hispanic voters across the country with a message that was positive,\" Sena said. \"We did a fair amount of studying how to create urgency without it feeling overtly heavy.\" During the campaign, President Donald Trump kept up a daily drumbeat of warnings about a caravan of \"bad thugs\" and potential terrorists intent on invading the U.S. from Mexico. He suggested sending up to 15,000 troops to the border.\u00a0 Lujan highlighted the victory of Antonio Delgado in New York as an example of how a Latino candidate won by keeping a positive message even when facing racist attacks. Delgado, a Harvard Law School graduate and Rhodes scholar, defeated Republican Rep. John Faso for a congressional seat representing the Hudson Valley. Republicans seized on his brief hip-hop career to portray Delgado, who is black, as unfit for office. Campaign ads by the National Republican Campaign Committee highlighted Delgado's stint as a rapper and portrayed him as a menacing figure. \"Antonio did not get distracted by any of that. What he did was he talked to the American people and the people of the 19th District of New York about the economic challenges that they are facing every day,\" Lujan said. The Hispanic community will have a record level of representation on Capitol Hill with at least 42 members: 34 Democrats and eight Republicans in both chambers. One House race featuring a Hispanic candidate, Gil Cisneros in California, has yet to be decided. Cisneros is narrowly trailing Republican Young Kim, who if elected would be the first Korean-American sent to Congress.",

            "article_content": "As federal investigators work to discover who's behind the pipe bombs mailed to a number of prominent Trump critics, some right-wing figures were quick to float the theory that it's all a politically motivated \"false flag\" planted by Democrats to make Republicans look bad. Without offering evidence, a handful of commentators raised the possibility, pointing out the coincidence of the timing two weeks before the midterms and the recipients' political affiliations. The FBI is currently investigating the devices and has not yet identified a suspect or motive. While the news was still unfolding Wednesday, radio host Rush Limbaugh aired the theory on his show. When a caller said \"my gut is telling me this is a left wing smoke screen,\" Limbaugh didn't disagree, suggesting that a Democrat was more likely to have sent the explosives than a Republican because \"things are not working out the way they thought\" for the party. Right-wing commentator Bill Mitchell went further, calling the bomb scare \"false flag BS\" and flooding his Twitter feed with claims that Democrats are to blame. \"Tip to Democrats: If you're gonna mail fake bombs to yourself, don't do it in bomb-shaped envelopes without a postmark. Looks fishy,\" he tweeted. Ann Coulter, the provocative author and commentator, tweeted her observation that, \"From the Haymarket riot to the Unibomber, bombs are a liberal tactic.\" The false flag theory also spread to a wider audience on Fox News Wednesday when a former FBI profiler, Jim Fitzgerald, brought up the \"false flag\" possibility on air. He said, \"It could be someone in there, some Democrat, low-level person ... who just decided, you know what, I'm going to put this out, because two weeks before a major election, who's going to look like the bad guy here? The Republicans.\" Host Martha MacCallum replied, \"Fascinating.\" MacCallum later pointed out in a tweet that Fitzgerald \"cited different avenues investigators will pursue to catch this bomber, starting with the most obvious: a republican who is out to get democrats\" as well as the \"less likely he said, insider angle.\" Actually, my guest was a detective who nabbed the Unabomber.  He cited different avenues investigators will pursue to catch this bomber, starting with the most obvious: a republican who is out to get democrats/ the int'l angle & then the less likely he said, insider angle. https://t.co/Bmn098ZBza Michael Flynn Jr., son of President Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn and a proponent of the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory, initially called it a \"total false flag operation\" before deleting his tweet. \"If I'm wrong about this being a political stunt, I'll own up to it,\" he wrote, calling the timing shortly before the midterms \"HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS.\" He also retweeted a quote that said the incidents have \"Soros astro-turfing written all over it,\" insinuating that liberal donor George Soros was secretly behind the plot to bomb himself and others. Folks, deleted a few tweets (not all) related to this ongoing craziness.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a false flag.  However, I hate the timing as it provides a PERFECT narrative for @TheDemocrats going into the mid terms. Another prominent conservative voice, Michael Savage, said, \"It's a high probability that the whole thing is set up as a false flag to gain sympathy for the Democrats... and to get our minds off the hordes of illegal aliens approaching our southern border.\" The term originally referred to pirate ships that flew flags of countries as a disguise to prevent their victims from fleeing or preparing for battle. According to the Anti-Defamation League, it's a concept frequently used by the \"anti-government extremist 'patriot' movement\" to discredit terrorist activities. \"'False flag operations are incidents staged by a government but blamed on some other government or entity as a pretext to curtail civil liberties or justify military action,\" the ADL explains. In the online context, conspiracy theorists often point to \"false flags\" when an official explanation doesn't fit their world view. Sarah Sobieraj, a sociology professor at Tufts University, told CBS News that the dissemination of such a theory without evidence can be \"toxic,\" especially with midterms coming up soon. \"The very foundation of democracy is that citizens' ability to make informed decisions on their own behalf in the voting booth,\" she said. \"When disinformation interferes with that premise, it's becomes un-American.\" Christopher Brito is a social media manager and trending content writer for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for a woman who allegedly had an affair with Trump and a cable news fixture, said in an interview with Time Magazine that the Democratic nominee for president in 2020 \"better be a white male.\" Avenatti has been mentioned, often by himself, as a potential presidential contender. \"I think it better be a white male,\" Avenatti said, because people are more likely to listen to white men than they are to women and minorities, which is why he believes he has had success representing Stormy Daniels and immigrants separated from their children at the U.S.-Mexico border. \"When you have a white male making the arguments, they carry more weight,\" he said. \"Should they carry more weight? Absolutely not. But do they? Yes.\" Many of the potential 2020 presidential candidates are women and people of color, such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris. After the article was published, Avenatti told the Daily Caller that those quotes were \"complete bulls---.\" \"I never said that, that's complete bulls---. That's my comment, complete bullsh---,\" he said. Avenatti told reporters later on Thursday that his comments were \"misquoted and out of context.\" He said that he had repeatedly discussed \"the need for white males to step up and call out racism.\" He added that he didn't believe it was an insensitive remark. Although Avenatti has garnered presidential buzz in recent months, and has visited the early primary states Iowa and New Hampshire to speak at Democratic events, his star has waned due to professional setbacks this month. Daniels' defamation lawsuit against Mr. Trump was dismissed by a federal judge earlier this month. Avenatti also suffered a setback when Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed. He\u00a0represents a woman who claims that Kavanaugh had been involved in sexual misconduct when he was a teenager. Many Democrats privately fumed that Avenatti's presence in the debate over Kavanaugh had been a distraction which aided Republicans. Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley sent a letter Thursday to the Justice Department requesting Avenatti and his client be criminally investigated for making potentially false claims. Avenatti argued in the Time piece that while there may be better Democratic presidential candidates, he would be more successful because of his aggressive tactics. He said that the Democrats have \"a lot of talent, but not a lot of fighters.\" In the article, Avenatti also took some pride in what he characterized as upsetting reporters, an activity which Mr. Trump also enjoys. He said that after he gave a rousing oration in New Hampshire, reporters \"were just ashen\" and he \"took tremendous pride in that moment.\" Although Avenatti may not be a traditional candidate, he had some defenders in the article. \"You've got to be brave to go up against Trump,\" said GOP consultant Rick Wilson. \"Avenatti's got balls. Giant, clanking, titanium balls.\"\u00a0 Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The looming threat of Tropical Storm Michael is upending the already hectic campaign season under way in the battleground state of Florida. The storm is forecast to smash into northwest Florida as a hurricane by midweek, and its approach had candidates scrambling Sunday to rearrange their plans. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum's campaign said he was canceling South Florida events planned for this week and that he was returning home to deal with storm preparations. Projections show the storm appeared increasingly likely to strike the state in the Florida Panhandle west of Tallahassee. Gillum is already under fire from Republicans who are running television ads that fault the Tallahassee mayor for power outages following Hurricane Hermine in 2016. Gov. Rick Scott and Gillum engaged in a public feud at the time over whether city officials were doing enough to get electricity restored in the heavily tree-lined city. Gillum, who as mayor is actually one of five officials that oversee city government, does not directly control the city-owned utility. But he was forced two years ago to answer questions about why Tallahassee officials turned down help from at least one outside utility company at the time. His campaign has contended that the ads being paid by the Republican Party of Florida are false. U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, who is now a Democrat but was elected governor as a Republican, called on GOP nominee Ron DeSantis to cancel the ads, saying he should \"unite with the rest of Florida, take down his false attacks ads, and help those facing down this coming storm.\" DeSantis's campaign has not said if it would ask Republicans to stop broadcasting the ads. But DeSantis put out a statement on Sunday saying that he was redirecting his staff and volunteers in northwest Florida to work on storm preparations instead of the campaign. Scott hinted briefly at the 2016 confrontation between Gillum and himself during a late afternoon media availability, saying it was important for local utilities to have mutual aid agreements to ensure power is restored quickly. Scott, who talked to Gillum directly on Sunday, said \"my job is to work with everyone\" to make sure communities are prepared. The storm threat is also forcing Scott, who is challenging U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson this year, to take a break from the campaign trail. He spent the day huddling with state officials and discussing emergency preparations with local officials. He also activated 500 members of the Florida National Guard. Scott was scheduled to be in Orlando on Monday when President Donald Trump visits the state. The White House says Trump will address the International Association of Chiefs of Police about law enforcement issues and securing the border with Mexico. Scott has made his handling of past storms a theme in one of his current campaign ads.",

            "article_content": "Oscar-winning filmmaker Michael Moore's stock in trade \u2013 political documentaries that expertly blend video clips, old newsreels and educational films with humor and needling stunts played upon politicians and corporate overlords \u2013 may be familiar by now, but as the situation in the world becomes more dizzyingly chaotic, it's a form of comfort food. Yes, the audience can tell themselves, someone gets it. In his latest, the director of \"Roger & Me\" and \"Bowling for Columbine\" has created a sequel of sorts to his 2004 film, \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" titled \"Fahrenheit 11/9\" (after the date that Donald Trump was declared winner of the 2016 presidential election). It is one of Moore's strongest films of late, not least because his most glaring target is so potent: President Trump, and how he got to where he is.  Surprisingly, there is less Trump fodder here than audiences might expect from such an outspoken critic of the president. Moore's experience with the man, back when he was just a bankrupt real estate tycoon and future reality TV star, dates to a shared appearance on Roseanne Barr's talk show in 1998, where Moore was gently asked by Barr's producers to hold his fire lest Trump walk off the stage in a fit of pique. Moore bit his tongue, and regretted it later, feeling he'd been played. He doesn't hold back now. And yes, he goes there \u2013 equating Trump's handling of the media and his repressive policies in office to Hitler's. Moore explains how it is but a short walk from demonizing entire classes of people, denigrating law enforcement and mocking the free press as liars, to fascism, and Moore blends Nazi propaganda footage with scenes from Trump rallies and white supremacist marches today to make the point that the candidate's (and now president's) rhetoric and actions have a predictable end result: divisiveness, violence, and despair in the institutions of democracy. Moore also juxtaposes audio of a Guatemalan child crying after being separated from her parent at the U.S. border with footage of Nazi guards separating Jewish families. Need more? Moore even puts Trump's own words into Hitler's mouth.  Trump's personal excesses aren't ignored, either; there are more pictures of him ogling his daughter, Ivanka, then anyone would ever want to see.  But the president's supporters may be mollified to note that the filmmaker spares no one. A considerable portion of \"Fahrenheit 11/9\" is devoted not to the disruptor who took down the Republican Party and remade it in his image, but to the Democratic Party establishment who sat idly by. In fact, party elites who block more progressive voices and candidates and preach \"compromise\" with the GOP are painted by Moore as even bigger threats to democracy, by stifling participation and prompting citizens to walk away from exercising their power to vote. The superdelegates that quashed Bernie Sanders' backers at the Democratic National Convention are just one example. \u00a0 Hillary Clinton gets some flack, though Moore helpfully annotates how so many male political and media figures who questioned Hillary's bona fides because of her gender had some baggage of their own with regards to dealings with the opposite sex. And two-term Democratic President Bill Clinton is painted as a DINO, pushing initiatives that wouldn't have been out of place on a Republican Party platform.  Even President Barack Obama is shown paying (moistened) lip service to the citizens of Flint, Michigan, when he fails to bring the cavalry to correct the city's miserable water problems. The result: broken hearts among activists who feel the moral center of the country had abandoned them.  The continuing disaster in Flint is actually the film's biggest story thread. Here Moore zeroes in on Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, a former executive who campaigned on running Michigan like a business, and his efforts to alter the source of Flint's water supply from the pristine Lake Huron to the contaminated Flint River, with calamitous results. Residents were left at the mercy of overseers who were not responsible to the people (after Snyder signed an Emergency Manager Law \u2013 even though there was no emergency \u2013 thereby removing democratically-elected officials from Flint and several other cities). Their actions led to irreversible, even fatal health effects.  Synder was later found to have borne (in the words of a University of Michigan School of Public Health report) \"significant legal responsibility\" for covering up the water problem, leaving parents unawares of the dangers facing their children (all of whom had consumed lead-laced water) and of a threat posed by an outbreak of Legionnaire's Disease.  Moore interviews pediatricians, activists and local officials who decry the lack of power over the government's actions, and it is here where Moore employs his puckish stunts, such as attempting a citizen's arrest of the governor.  But while it's the most painful section to watch, the disaster in Flint also sets up Moore's ultimate thesis for the film, which is that the exercise of power by the people is a potent, if barely-tapped, resource that can actually overcome the nefarious efforts of special interests, particularly conservative politicians fighting against the general public's more liberal inclinations. Moore meets some of the \"extraordinary ordinary people,\" who, since President Trump took office, have decided to run for office themselves, taking down party stalwarts and challenging the status quo. He also looks at a rebirth within the nation's battered labor movement, including the West Virginia teachers' strike, which sparked similar strikes by teachers across the country after they \u2013 amazingly \u2013 won their demands; and at how the teenagers of Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, showed their elders what an anti-gun violence movement can achieve. A bunch of kids!  \"Fahrenheit 11/9\" is terrifying in showing just how fragile and elusive the idea of democracy is, after a couple hundred years of trying to get it right. It also reminds people who are ostracized, cut off from the American Dream and living in hope that they will be rescued by a political leader, of any stripe, that democracy's best hope is themselves, working together for the interest of all. And it's right there in plain sight, in our nation's motto: E pluribus unum \u2026 out of many, one. \"Fahrenheit 11/9\" (distributed by Briarcliff Entertainment) is now playing. 126 mins. The film is rated R, for language (because today's politics lead people to say \"What the ****?\" a lot). To watch a trailer for \"Fahrenheit 11/9\" click on the video player below.

            "article_content": "House Republicans say they strongly favor new federal regulations on sports gambling after the Supreme Court\u00a0allowed states to open sports books. At a hearing of a House Judiciary subcommittee, GOP members Thursday said they were concerned advertisements and online gambling platforms could target minors, and said they feared the potential for match-fixing. \"For Congress to do nothing is the worst possible alternative,\" said Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican. Without any action to regulate sports gambling, he said, \"there are going to be people who get hurt and get hurt badly.\" The hearing was the first Congress has held on the issue since the Supreme Court in June struck down a law that limited sports gambling to four states, and full-service sports books only to Nevada. Since then, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi and West Virginia have legalized betting on pro and amateur sports, with more states considering adding sports books to their existing racetracks or casinos. The prospect of federal action is murky at best. No bill has been introduced to enact the reforms discussed by Sensenbrenner and other GOP members, and the committee may have different priorities if Democrats take over the House in the midterm elections. A gambling-industry representative and a Nevada regulator told the committee that states were fully capable of regulating sports gambling on their own and said many of the fears about the ills of expanded sports gambling have not been realized. The industry argues that legalization will move sports betting from illegal offshore operators to licensed businesses that pay taxes and have consumer protections. Gambling proponents also argue that match-fixing and other nefarious activities are easier to prevent and snuff out in a regulated market. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican and the Judiciary Committee chairman, said he thought there was a federal role to play in regulating online gambling because it can't be contained within state borders. \"I do not believe gambling is a victimless activity,\" Goodlatte said. \"I think that online gambling, in particular, can be more destructive to the families and communities of addictive gamblers than if a bricks-and-mortar casino were built next door.\" Jon Bruning, a Republican former Nebraska attorney general, told the committee that young people in the United Kingdom, where legal sports betting is widespread, were being exploited by licensed online operators, citing studies that showed minors are placing bets and being bombarded by advertisements. In Nevada online sports gambling has not yet proved popular, said Becky Harris, the chair of the Nevada Gaming Control Board. She said protections are in place, including a requirement that bettors go to a casino in person and undergo a background check before placing bets online. Jocelyn Moore, an NFL spokeswoman and lobbyist, used the word \"integrity\" 24 times in her seven-page written testimony. She urged Congress to limit legal gambling to those 21 and older, require operators to use official data from leagues and bar risky bets on in-game action that, she said, are particularly susceptible to match-fixing. The league also wants more aggressive enforcement against illegal bookies. Unions for the four major U.S. professional leagues and Major League Soccer asked Congress to include protections for players and their families in any federal regulation.",

Stewart unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination for governor in 2017. He is known for his controversial right-wing views, particularly on preserving Confederate monuments. In April 2017, he compared the removal of Confederate monuments to atrocities committed by the terrorist group ISIS in\u00a0on Twitter. After the deadly march by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, Stewart refused to denounce participants at the rally, telling the Washington Post that politicians who did so \"played right into the hands of the left wing.\" He has also been associated with alt-right figures such as Paul Nehlen and Jason Kessler.\u00a0 There is no love lost between Stewart and the state Republican Party -- several Republican politicians have denounced Stewart and his campaign. A Republican state representative called Stewart a \"charlatan\" and a \"demagogue\" on the floor of the state House in February. President Trump endorsed Stewart in June, after he won his primary. \"Congratulations to Corey Stewart for his great victory for Senator from Virginia. Now he runs against a total stiff, Tim Kaine, who is weak on crime and borders, and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. Don't underestimate Corey, a major chance of winning!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. Kaine has led Stewart by wide margins in every major poll conducted since June. A University of Mary Washington poll from earlier this month showed Kaine with 52 percent support among likely voters, compared to 36 percent support for Stewart.

            "article_content": "LONDON -- Britain's main opposition Labour Party announced Tuesday it will reject Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed divorce deal with the European Union when it comes to a vote in Parliament and might support a new Brexit referendum. One official said May's government was offering the country a choice between \"really bad and even worse.\" If Britain and the EU agree on a deal, it must be approved by individual EU nations before Britain leaves. In the U.K. that means a vote by lawmakers. The math on that vote looks ominous for May's government, however, because it lacks an overall majority. Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer told Labour's annual conference that the party would vote against a Brexit deal along the lines that May is proposing because it does not meet \"six tests\" it has set, including protecting workers' rights and retaining access to European markets. \"We do not accept that the choice is between whatever the prime minister manages to cobble together and no deal ... between 'really bad' and 'even worse,'\" Starmer said. Starmer said if the British Parliament rejected the deal there should be a new election on Brexit. \"If that is not possible, we must have other options,\" he said. \"Our options must include campaigning for a public vote -- and nobody is ruling out 'remain' as an option.\" Starmer's suggestion that a new referendum could reverse Britain's 2016 decision to leave the EU -- which was not in the advanced printed text of his speech -- drew a standing ovation from many delegates in the conference hall. Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has long opposed the idea of a new Brexit referendum, saying the party must respect voters' decision to leave. Most of the party's half a million members voted in 2016 to remain in the EU, but many of its 257 lawmakers represent areas that supported Brexit. Brendan Chilton of the pro-Brexit group Labour Leave argues that the party would \"hemorrhage votes\" if it tried to stop Britain from leaving the 28-nation bloc. But with Britain due to leave EU in six months, on March 29, and negotiations at an impasse, Corbyn is under intense pressure from party members to support a new public vote. Conference delegates are expected later Tuesday to back a compromise motion leaving the option of a second Brexit referendum open but not calling for it directly. EU leaders last week rejected the British government's blueprint for future trade ties at a fractious summit in the Austrian city of Salzburg. May's plan seeks to keep the U.K. in the EU's vast single market for goods but not for services, in order to ensure free trade with the bloc and an open border between the U.K.'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. But EU officials say that amounts to unacceptable \"cherry-picking\" of elements of membership in the bloc without accepting all the costs and responsibilities. The Salzburg rebuff left May under siege from Brexit-supporting Conservatives, who want her to seek a looser relationship based on a bare-bones free trade agreement that would leave Britain free to strike new deals around the world. Asked this week by CBS News' John Dickerson whether she felt \"humiliated\" by the rebuke from her fellow European leaders, May insisted she had not.\u00a0 \"What I felt was that I think there's a plan on the table from us. If they have issues with it, let's hear what those issues are... Look, every prime minister is faced with different challenges \u2013 domestically, globally... I've never said that this was going to be an easy process. These are tough negotiations. And, you know, as we enter the final straits of those negotiations, of course it becomes in many ways even tougher because we're closer to the end point.\" For now, May is sticking by her plan. After a meeting of her divided Cabinet on Monday, May's Downing St. office said hers is \"the only plan on the table ... and she remains confident of securing a deal with the EU.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Tuesday that time is tight. An EU summit next month is seen as a make-or-break moment for a Brexit deal. Speaking in Berlin, Merkel said there were \"six to eight weeks of very hard work in front of us in which we must take the political decisions.\" \"Of course, to a significant extent, this also depends on what Britain really wants - the discussion isn't so clear here,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday approved a wide-ranging, $854 billion bill that funds the military and a host of civilian agencies for the next year and provides a short-term fix to keep the government open through early December. The measure includes $675 billion for the Defense Department and boosts military pay by 2.6 percent, the largest pay raise in nine years. The bill also approves spending for Health and Human Services, Education, Labor and other agencies, including a 5 percent boost for the National Institutes of Health. Senators approved the bill 93-7. The measure now goes to the House, where lawmakers are expected to approve it next week, days ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline for a government shutdown. The stopgap bill would not address President Trump's long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. GOP leaders have said they prefer to resolve the issue after the Nov. 6 elections. The Senate vote comes as House and Senate negotiators work to approve a separate spending bill that would pay for the Interior, Agriculture, Transportation and other departments, as well as the Treasury and federal courts. When combined with a measure approved last week, the three compromise spending bills would account for nearly 90 percent of annual federal spending, including the military and most civilian agencies. Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., called the bill approved Tuesday historic, noting that the package boosts funding for medical research and the opioid epidemic, while providing troops with the largest pay raise in nearly a decade. \"We are making real progress here\" in approving spending bills before the new budget year begins Oct. 1, Shelby said. \"We are going to make the appropriations trains run again.\" The focus on agency-level spending bills marks a departure from recent years, when Congress routinely ignored individual spending measures in favor of giant \"omnibus\" spending packages that fund the entire government all at once \u2014 often after the new budget year had begun. The Senate had not passed a spending bill covering Labor or Health in more than a decade before approving one last month. Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations panel, said he was pleased that the compromise bill eliminates controversial policy riders that Leahy and other lawmakers call \"poison pills.\" Such riders frequently lead to a spending bill's defeat even as lawmakers from both parties agree on a vast majority of spending priorities. \"We did our job and focused on what we should be doing - making responsible, thoughtful decisions about how to fund these federal agencies and leaving controversial policy issues out of it,\" Leahy said in a refrain that has become familiar on the Senate floor in recent weeks as Leahy, Shelby and other leaders fend off partisan proposals. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a conservative Republican, blasted the bill for failing to address right-to-life issues. \"For the second straight year of unified Republican governance - unified pro-life governance - Congress's annual spending bills will include no new reforms protecting unborn children, or getting federal taxpayers out of the abortion business,\" Lee said. The bill approved Tuesday provides $147.9 billion for military equipment and upgrades, including $24.2 billion for 13 Navy ships, including two Virginia-class submarines and three fast-moving littoral combat ships. The relatively small ships are intended to operate in congested areas near the shore against small boats and mines. The bill also includes $9.3 billion for 93 new F-35 aircraft and more than $4 billion for Black Hawk, Apache and other helicopters. The 5 percent boost for NIH is the fourth straight significant increase for the biomedical research agency. The measure would hike spending for Alzheimer's research to more than $2.3 billion, essentially quadrupling spending levels from four years ago on a disease that requires hundreds of billions of dollars for dementia-related care. The bill also would provide a $206 million increase for treatment of opioid addiction, bringing spending to $3.8 billion to confront what lawmakers called an epidemic of abuse. It would also boost spending for the Head Start preschool program and increase maximum Pell Grants for college education.",

            "article_content": "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- President Trump tried his best to appeal to coal country but, amid a truckload of bad political news, the top coal-producing state didn't love him back. Instead, Wyoming voters chose Secretary of State Mark Gordon, a rancher who grew up at the foot of the Bighorn Mountains, over political mega-donor Foster Friess in the state's Republican primary for governor. Calling Friess \"Strong on Crime, Borders & 2nd Amendment,\" Mr. Trump had endorsed Friess on Twitter as voting got underway Tuesday. Mr. Trump hours later walked back Obama-era environmental regulations viewed as economic warfare in coal country and told a West Virginia rally that miners were headed back to work. About 40 percent of the nation's coal comes from Wyoming - Mr. Trump no doubt got heard out West. Wyoming voters had their own ideas. \"This is a governor's race. This is about the state of Wyoming,\" Gordon said after winning his six-way primary. \"President Trump is doing great things that are important for Wyoming in terms of getting our economy going, and all of that. But in the end, I think people in Wyoming concentrated on who's got the experience, who's got the record and who's got the best message going forward for Wyoming.\" Mr. Trump won Wyoming by a wide margin in 2016, but his support here may be seen as a mile wide and inch deep. After all, Wyoming Republicans by far preferred another candidate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, in the battle for the GOP presidential nomination that year. Wyoming could even choose a Democrat again. Attorney and former state Rep. Mary Throne, who was raised on a ranch not far from Gordon's and beat three others to win the Democratic nomination for governor, will be a formidable opponent, Gordon said. \"Traditionally in Wyoming, we focus on the person and not the party when it comes to electing our governors. And that we like our governors to be independent and thoughtful and all about Wyoming,\" Throne said Tuesday. The winner will succeed term-limited Gov. Matt Mead. Like Democratic Gov. Dave Freudenthal, who served two terms before Mead and then on St. Louis-based Arch Coal's board of directors, Throne describes herself as pro-coal. There's no good reason to doubt it. Throne grew up in Campbell County, home to some of the world's biggest open-pit coal mines. Throne supporter Jeran Artery told CBS Cheyenne affiliate KGWN-TV, \"As a Democrat, sometimes I'm like, 'Mary, you could be a little more left on that.' She is pretty moderate and the state really needs that. What is lacking is a voice of reason to say hey lets take a step back and look at this and think it through. That's why I think Mary will be a breath of fresh air for this state. I think that's why we have elected Democrats in the past its just the right thing to do for Wyoming.\" While Mr. Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and attorney Michael Cohen were convicted of felonies Friday, the president did pick a winner in Wyoming. Mr. Trump endorsed Sen. John Barrasso over a wealthy opponent, Jackson Hole business investor Dave Dodson. Delayed by thunderstorms, Barrasso barely made it back to Wyoming from Washington, D.C., in time to hear he'd won the Republican primary. Busy traveling, Barrasso said he had read little about the news involving Mr. Trump's associates. He declined comment on how Mr. Trump's political and potentially legal fortunes could affect his work with the White House. \"I go to work every day thinking about the people of Wyoming. Every day I wake up I think about Wyoming, jobs, the economy, how we can make life better for the people of Wyoming. I think that the voters saw that,\" Barrasso said. Barrasso faces Wilson businessman Gary Trauner in the general election. Trauner, who ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination, ran for the U.S. House twice and came within half a point of beating Republican Rep. Barbara Cubin in 2006. Incumbent Liz Cheney easily won the Republican nomination for Wyoming's lone U.S. House seat. Cheney beat two other Republicans, Blake Stanley of Cheyenne and Rod Miller of Buford. Stanley and Miller both characterized themselves as blue-collar conservatives and ran low-key campaigns. Cheney will run against Laramie businessman Greg Hunter, who beat attorney Travis Helm for the Democratic nomination for U.S. House.",

            "article_content": "WATERVILLE, Minn.\u2014 For all the talk of a blue wave sweeping Democrats back into the House majority this fall, their efforts could be thwarted in one of the nation's bluest states. Voters in the sprawling farm country south of Minneapolis and in the economically struggling Iron Range along the Canadian border give Republicans in those two congressional districts perhaps their best chance anywhere for flipping Democratic seats. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats in November to retake the House, but the odds grow long if they lose districts they currently hold. Democratic incumbents in both Minnesota districts are leaving office, and the races to replace them are widely rated as tossups. President Trump carried both by about 15 points in 2016, even as Hillary Clinton narrowly won Minnesota. \"Minnesota is going to be ground zero for control of the House,\" said Corry Bliss, director of the Conservative Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Former U.S. Rep. Steve Israel of New York, who served four years as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, agreed. \"It will go a long way to maintaining Republican control of the House, picking up those two seats,\" Israel said. \"Both sides know that. And that's why you're going to see millions of dollars being spent on all those races.\" The GOP is also eying two seats in Nevada and single seats in Arizona, Florida, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania as possible flips. Despite Minnesota's reputation as a liberal stronghold \u2014 it hasn't gone for a Republican president since 1972 \u2014 the state has become a major battleground for the parties. Tens of millions of dollars in outside political advertising have flooded the state in recent years as Republicans tried to pick off outstate members of Congress while Democrats focused on the suburbs. The GOP now holds three of the state's eight House seats. The two Minnesota seats opened up when Rep. Tim Walz, in the 1st District, decided to run for governor and 74-year-old Rep. Rick Nolan, in the 8th, decided to retire ahead of a difficult re-election fight. Both Democrats just barely hung on in 2016. Republican Jim Hagedorn, who narrowly lost to Walz in 2016, is hoping to break through in his fourth try in a district that has historically leaned Republican. Congress is a bit of a family affair; his father, Tom, once represented part of the district, and Hagedorn himself spent years as a Treasury Department official in Washington. Earlier this summer at Waterville's Bullhead Days \u2014 named for a particularly ugly-looking member of the catfish family \u2014 Hagedorn worked up a sweat while working spectators along a parade route that wound past a stand selling fried bullhead. Waterville, a town of around 1,800 people nestled up against Tetonka Lake and Sakatah Lake, counts tourism and agriculture among keys to the economy. It's a town that went for Trump by 26 points in 2016. \"I want to be a partner with the president,\" Hagedorn said. Howard Mack, owner of Whitewater Creek Grain and Feed, said he and his customers spend a lot of time talking about tariffs and other national political issues, and while they're nervous about being bargaining chips in a trade war they're sticking with Mr. Trump while keeping their fingers crossed that his hardball strategy works out. Mack said Hagedorn's conservative positions fit the district well. \"I give the man a ton of credit for working as hard as he has to get this job,\" Mack said. In northeast Minnesota, Republican Pete Stauber is leaning on a pro-Trump message, too, in hopes of breaking through. The 8th was once a Democratic bastion thanks to Duluth and the Iron Range, with a large blue-collar workforce drawn to jobs in mining, railroads, shipping and forest products. But declining mining employment and a district boundary that has crept toward the Twin Cities exurbs have turned it into swing territory. Nolan's departure left Democrats in disarray, with a five-way primary coming Tuesday and a base bitterly split over new copper-nickel mining ventures that worry environmentalists. Pro-mining factions helped drive Mr. Trump's big margin there in 2016, and his tariffs on imported steel are playing well in a district where many Democrats also tilt conservative on guns and abortion. Stauber is a county commissioner and retired Duluth police lieutenant who once headed the officers' union. \"Mining is a big thing\" in the district, said St. Louis County GOP Chairman Ron Britton. Too many Democrats are either anti-mining or wishy-washy on the issue, he said. \"We're very optimistic this year, much more than we have been in past years,\" Britton said. Stauber got boosts from a Trump rally in Duluth in June and a visit by Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday. He had raised over $960,000 by late July \u2014 more than all the Democrats combined. In a show of the national focus on his race, much of the money came from leadership PACs run by Republican members of Congress. In the 1st District, Hagedorn, the GOP's endorsed candidate, still must survive a primary challenge from state Sen. Carla Nelson, another pro-Trump, anti-abortion conservative. Democrat Dan Feehan, a veteran of two combat tours in Iraq who became a high-ranking Defense Department official in the Obama administration, awaits the winner.",

            "article_content": "MAE SAI, Thailand -- With their heads bowed and wearing orange robes, the members of the boys' soccer team rescued from almost three weeks trapped in a cave in northern Thailand on Saturday completed their time as novice Buddhist monks. About 300 people gathered for the ceremony on a rainy morning that saw the boys leave temple life to return to their families. Those present gave alms -- flowers, food, money -- as a gesture of their religious devotion.  The July 25 ordination of 11 boys of the Wild Boars soccer team along with the 25-year-old coach was especially dedicated to a former Thai navy SEAL, Saman Gunan, who died while diving during a volunteer mission to supply the cave with oxygen tanks essential to a successful rescue. A twelfth  boy did not go through the religious ritual because he isn't Buddhist.  At the temple near Thailand's mountainous border with Myanmar, the boys and their coach sat barefooted in a large pavilion in their orange robes. The adults sitting behind them wore white. With heads bowed, they prayed, fidgeted and occasionally yawned as monks chanted sacred texts. They then placed new monks' robes on a table in front of a large photo of Saman.\u00a0 The experience was seen as a \"spiritual cleansing for the boys\" and also fulfilled a promise by the families to remember Saman, BBC News reported. The nine days they spent praying, meditating and cleaning their temple was a nod to a Thai lucky number. As the boys completed their time, Coach Ekapol \"Ake\" Chanthawong remained in his Buddhist robe, as he has committed to an extended period in the monkhood.  Although they will be giving up their Buddhist robes, it is likely that the boys will retain some of the solitude of temple life, as the government has discouraged for the time being any interviews with them, wielding the threat of legal action under child protection laws.  While there has been some criticism that the government wants to control the narrative of the boys' ordeal to exploit for political purposes -- Thailand's military rulers are seeking to booster their popularity ahead of a possible election next year -- psychologists agree that the boys may be vulnerable to post-traumatic stress disorder. Both their physical and mental health has been judged fine.  According Dr. Paul Auerbach of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Stanford University's medical school, it's possible that they might suffer withdrawal or perhaps post-traumatic stress disorder, which is characterized by symptoms that include insomnia, nightmares, hypervigilance, low mood, difficulty concentrating on schoolwork, flashbacks and avoidance of situations similar to those that caused the original trauma.  \"On the bright side, it is predictable that not all will be adversely affected -- perhaps only about a third of them -- and in those cases only a few might require professional psychological or psychiatric intervention,\" he said, speaking before the rescue.  The boys and their coach entered the cave on June 23 for a quick, casual trek, but flooding quickly blocked the exit and they had to retreat deeper inside the cave. Heavy rains raised water levels further and thwarted the initial searches before two British divers on July 2 found the group huddled on a dry patch of ground, safe but hungry.\u00a0 The boys and their coach were trying to dig their way out when they heard voices in the darkness. The coach quickly told everyone to be quiet.\u00a0 \"We weren't sure if it was for real,\" said 14-year-old Adul Samon. \"So we stopped and listened. And it turned out to be true.\" They were extricated from the cave in an intricate operation involving an international team of divers over three days beginning July 8.\u00a0 The epic event is being commemorated with construction of a museum, expected to open within six months, along with a statue of Saman, who is considered a national hero and was cremated in a royally sponsored funeral. His ashes were scattered in the Mekong River. Chanta Jai-Ngiem told \"CBS This Morning\" that when she first heard that her son Dom had been found, she was overcome with emotion. She first saw his face on TV when Thai officials released video of the boys alive inside the cave after nine days.  \"I was crying and screaming with happiness,\" she said. She said last month that she is ready for things to go back to normal. \"I would like my son to have a normal life,\" she said. \"I would like it to be the same it was before.",

Both she and her opponent Democrat Anthony Brindisi have raised $1.9 million in the current election cycle.\u00a0 But, at least in the remarks open to the press, the president focused much more on his administration's efforts, and on blasting Democrats, than on Tenney. Mr. Trump turned the speech into a list of what he sees as some of his administration's greatest accomplishments, including eliminating the penalty for the individual mandate.

John McCain, the president's only public reference of McCain on Monday was at the speech to Tenney supporters.

            "article_content": "TORONTO --\u00a0Of all the things people in Toronto are horrified by in the aftermath of the\u00a0shooting that killed two people and injured 13,\u00a0this stands out: The man responsible had a handgun. To mass shooting-weary America - where there are about 300 million guns of all kinds - possession of a handgun might seem commonplace. But in Toronto, the very idea that someone would have a handgun, much less take it out in public and fire it, is nearly incomprehensible. On Tuesday evening, after nearly 10 hours of discussing gun crimes, the City Council voted to urge the federal and provincial government to ban the sale of handguns and handgun ammunition in the largest city in Canada, and the fourth largest in North America. \"If anything, what's happened in the United States is what not to do,\" said City Councilman Joe Cressy, who proposed the motion Tuesday. Agreed Toronto Mayor John Tory: \"Why does anyone in this city need to have a gun at all?\" The measure passed 41 to four; the country's public safety minister said Tuesday that Ottawa was already considering tightening handgun laws, even prior to Sunday's shooting. It's unclear how the shooter in Sunday's tragedy obtained his gun. And officials haven't discovered a motive for why 29-year-old Faisal Hussain targeted diners enjoying a warm summer night at restaurants and cafes in Toronto's popular Greektown neighborhood, killing a 10-year-old girl and 18-year-old woman. His parents said he had suffered from severe mental illness his entire life. Cressy acknowledged that banning handguns isn't the only thing Toronto should do to combat gun violence, which is on the rise in the city of roughly 3 million residents. Even before Sunday's shooting, city leaders were concerned about an uptick in gun violence that had prompted the Toronto police to deploy dozens of additional officers over the weekend.  Toronto has seen 23 gun homicides so far this year, compared to 16 fatal shootings in the first half of 2017.\u00a0 Cressy said crime prevention programs, helping those released from prison find jobs, mentoring kids and diversion programs are all initiatives that should be beefed up, along with meeting people's mental health needs. Canada overhauled its laws after the country's worst mass shooting in 1989, when gunman Marc Lepine killed 14 women and himself at Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique college. It's now illegal to possess an unregistered handgun or any kind of rapid-fire weapon. Canada also requires training, a personal risk assessment, two references, spousal notification and criminal record checks to obtain a permit. Canadians have long taken comfort in the peacefulness of their communities and are nervous about anything that might indicate they are moving closer to their American counterparts. \"There isn't a handgun culture here,\" said Toronto resident Alison MacLean, shaking her head and wearing a T-shirt with symbols of a peace sign, a heart and a moose. \"Handguns aren't part of the common discourse.\" Before 2012, about 75 percent of illegal firearms in Canada were trafficked from the United States. By 2017, however, about half originated from domestic sources, putting an end to the idea that most of Canada's illegal guns come from across the border, said Det. Rob Di Danieli of the Toronto police guns and gangs unit. Legal Canadian gun owners are selling their weapons illegally, he said. The allure of a quick sell at a high profit margin is one reason legal owners might sell their guns. One man sold 47 guns and made over $100,000 in a five-month period, Di Danieli said. \"They go get their license for the purpose of becoming a firearms trafficker,\" he said. \"A lot of people are so ready to blame the big bad Americans, but we had our own little problem here.\" A big difference between Canada and the U.S. is the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which grants Americans the right to bear arms. In Canada, gun ownership is not enshrined in the constitution. \"Canadians, unlike Americans, do not have a constitutional right to bear arms,\" Canada's high court said in a 1993 decision that upheld a ban on convertible semi-automatic weapons. \"Indeed, most Canadians prefer the peace of mind and sense of security derived from the knowledge that the possession of automatic weapons is prohibited,\" the court said. Another difference is that Canadian politicians are not beholden to groups like the National Rifle Association, which donates millions of dollars to U.S. campaigns. Canada's federal elections laws put limits on contributions to political parties so that only individuals, not corporations or lobby groups, may donate. In the wake of Sunday's shooting, many here said they were reminded of another mass shooting, one that happened 1,500 miles away in Florida in February, when a former student walked into a school with an assault rifle and killed 17 students and staff members and injured 17 others. \"I was thinking about the victims in Parkland, and their strength,\" said 24-year-old Laila Hawrylyshyn. \"And I hope the victims here in Toronto have the strength to recover from this.\" She and a several dozen of her classmates in a government relations class at York University attended the City Council session on Tuesday where council members discussed gun violence with the city's police chief. Said Cressy: \"A 10-year-old and an 18-year-old dying is heartbreaking enough. I can't fathom what it's like as a parent to wake up and send your child off to school and wonder if they'll be killed. That's not a city you want to live in.\"",

            "article_content": "OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine - The U.S. and Canada are engaged in a trade dispute, angering Canadians, but it doesn't seem to be having an impact on tourism. Not yet, anyway. In Old Orchard Beach, popular with Quebecers, innkeepers report that Canadian tourism remains strong despite the harsh words last month when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed that Canada \"won't be pushed around\" and President Donald Trump called the prime minister \"weak\" and \"dishonest.\" Several weeks later, Canada imposed billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs in response to the Trump administration's duties on Canadian steel and aluminum. Mostepha Azizi, a vacationer from Montreal, said he's confident the war of words will end and that \"reason will prevail\" between the neighbors. \"For me, it's just a question of time,\" he said. \"This thing will settle down. Trudeau and Trump have to find a solution to the problem.\" Canada accounts for the largest number of international visitors to the U.S., with more than 20 million of them pumping nearly $20 billion into the U.S. economy, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. The number of Canadians heading south has grown this year, and the flap between Trump and Trudeau after last month's G7 summit in Quebec didn't change that. Border-crossing data indicates the number of Canadian motorists returning from the U.S. in June grew 12.7 percent from last year, a healthy increase, according to a license plate-scanning system used by the Canadian government. A so-called \"Trump Slump\" never materialized after Trump's election, and travel to the U.S. is growing despite anecdotal evidence that some Canadians are choosing to travel elsewhere, said Allison Wallace, of Flight Centre Canada, a travel agency with 150 locations across Canada. \"All of that being said, we've not seen a trade war like this, so that may change,\" she said, \"but as of now, the U.S. remains a very popular destination.\" In June, Canada's CTV reported that angry Canadian shoppers and travelers \"are mounting strikes against America's pocketbook by boycotting U.S. goods and trips to the States\" as the summer travel season begins. \"On Twitter, hashtags including #BuyCanadian, #BoycottUSProducts and #BoycottUSA are spreading tips on using purchasing power to defend Canada's honour,\" CTV\u00a0reported. Florida gets the largest number of visitors from the north, typically snowbirds in the winter. New England is also a popular destination, and beaches like Old Orchard Beach and Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, are an easy drive from Canada's Atlantic provinces. In Old Orchard, Canadian flags are flown, and many desk workers speak French. Fries are served up Canadian-style, topped with vinegar, or with gravy and cheese. For now, the value of the Canadian dollar is having a bigger impact than the flap between the leaders. The loonie is currently worth only 76 cents in the U.S. Claire Beaulieu, an owner of the Motel Kebek 2, said Canadians will keep coming because of the 7-mile stretch of sandy beach with plenty of rooms, food and a beachside amusement park. Canadians account for 95 percent of her bookings, she said. For tourism, visitors are more interested in amenities than politics, even though many are baffled by the U.S. president's actions, she said.\u00a0 Fred Kennedy, owner of Aoulette Beach Resort, said his bookings are strong despite the relatively weak Canadian dollar, and he predicts relations between the countries will improve. \"I think it's going to blow over,\" he said. \"By this time next year, things will be patched up.\" Down the beach, at Kebek 3, owner Suzanne Beaulieu said her bookings were strong, too, but she acknowledged that could change next year if U.S.-Canadian relations remain frosty. At least one customer advised her she'll rethink her plans next summer. \"She said, 'As long as Trump is in office, I don't think I'll be back,'\" Beaulieu said. Vacationer Stella Bigras, of Laval, Quebec, said the trade flap and war of words are between two leaders. Regular folks, she said, still get along just fine. \"We are friends,\" she said. \"We are neighbors.\" \"I hope we're going to stay friends, and Trump and Trudeau will calm down. I think that we all always be here for the USA, even if we're having stupid arguments. I think the USA will always be here for us, too. So I'm pretty sure we're going to through this together.\"",

            "article_content": "PHOENIX -- An Arizona state lawmaker was seen telling a sheriff's deputy he sometimes drives as fast as 130 or 140 mph after he was pulled over for speeding. The deputy said in a report later that the driver claimed to have legislative immunity. State Rep. Paul Mosley was stopped on March 27 outside of Parker, Arizona. The rural area near the California border is in Mosley's district and more than 150 miles west of the state capital in Phoenix. A body camera video obtained by KLPZ and first published on its website ParkerLiveOnline.com shows a La Paz County Sheriff's deputy warning Mosley to slow down. Mosley was going 97 mph in a 55 mph zone on state Route 95, the news outlet reported. Mosley then says he sometimes drives \"130, 140, 120,\" while trying to get home to surprise his wife. He says he doesn't notice the speed because of his vehicle's nice wheels and suspension. The deputy's written report said Mosley told him not to waste time on the incident because he has legislative immunity, KLPZ reported. \"I don't break the law because I can, but because, you know, I'm just trying to get home,\" Mosley says in the video. Mosely on Thursday posted an apology on his Facebook page, referring to the comments to the deputy as a joke. \"My desire to get home to see my family does not justify how fast I was speeding nor my reference to legislative immunity when being pulled over,\" he said. He said his comments to the deputy were inappropriate and showed bad judgment. While the state constitution does provide for certain kinds of legislative immunity, elections lawyer Kory Langhofer told CBS affiliate KPHO-TV it exists only to protect lawmakers from missing votes during the legislative session because they happen to be arrested on a minor legal matter. \"It is a big no-no to claim legislative immunity to get out of a speeding ticket,\" Langhofer told the station. \"It really is just a shameful thing. It also doesn't work.\" A document from November 2002 shared by the House Rules Committee says speeding tickets - as well as violations for driving under the influence - aren't covered. The video does not show the deputy, who was not identified, issuing a speeding ticket, but the incident is under review by Cochise County Attorney Brian McIntyre after the La Paz County Attorney's Office referred the incident to avoid a potential conflict of interest. McIntyre said in a statement a complaint has not yet been filed. \"I do not believe the ethical rules permit me to say whether I intend to charge the matter or not, however,\" McIntyre's statement said. \"I am able to say that it will be reviewed consistent with our ethical obligations and a charging decision will be made as time and resources permit.\" Speaker of the House J.D. Mesnard said he was \"disturbed\" to see Mosley's actions and doesn't think the immunity provision would apply. \"Nothing short of an emergency justifies that kind of speeding, and assertions of immunity in that situation seem outside the intent of the constitutional provision regarding legislative immunity,\" Mesnard said. A search of court records in Arizona didn't immediately turn up any traffic violations issued against Mosley. Mosley, a Republican from Lake Havasu City, was elected in 2016; he is running for another two-year term in November. The Arizona Fraternal Order of Police withdrew its endorsement of Mosley and condemned his speeding. \"Rep. Mosley's recklessness, his demeanor and his utter disregard for the safety of the public represent the exact opposite of what the Arizona Fraternal Order of Police looks for in an elected official,\" the group's president John Ortolano said in a statement. \"Potentially lethal speeding isn't a joke. We will not stand with those who think it's acceptable or funny to risk the lives of others while behind the wheel of a lethal weapon.\"",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is pardoning two cattle ranchers convicted of arson in a case that case sparked the armed occupation of a national wildlife refuge in Oregon.\u00a0Dwight and Steven Hammond were convicted in 2012 of intentionally and maliciously setting fires on public lands. The arson crime carried a minimum prison sentence of five years, but a sympathetic federal judge, on his last day before retirement, decided the penalty was too stiff and gave the father and son much lighter prison terms. Prosecutors won an appeal and the Hammonds were re-sentenced to serve the mandatory minimum. In a statement released on Tuesday, the White House called the five year prison sentence \"unjust.\" \"The Hammonds are devoted family men, respected contributors to their local community, and have widespread support from their neighbors, local law enforcement, and farmers and ranchers across the West,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. \"Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency.\" The Hammonds' sentence sparked a protest from Ammon Bundy and dozens of others, who occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near the Hammond ranch in southeastern Oregon from Jan. 2 to Feb. 11, 2016, complaining the Hammonds were victims of federal overreach. The armed occupiers changed the refuge's name to the Harney County Resource Center, reflecting their belief that the federal government has only a very limited right to own property within a state's borders. Bundy was arrested during a Jan. 26 traffic stop, effectively ending the protest. Another key occupier, Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum, was fatally shot that day by Oregon State Police. CBS News' Mark Knoller reports that the pardons for the Hammonds bring to 7 the number of pardons granted to date by Mr. Trump. He's also granted 2 commutations of sentence as well. Mr. Trump has been especially pleased with news coverage of his actions, which included commuting the sentence of Alice Johnson, a woman serving a life sentence for drug offenses whose case had been championed by reality television star Kim Kardashian West. He has repeatedly referenced emotional video of Johnson being freed from prison and running into her family members' arms, and has said he's considering thousands more cases \u2014 both famous and not. But critics say the president could be ignoring valid claims for clemency as he works outside the typical pardon process, focusing on cases brought to his attention by friends, famous people and conservative media pundits. Aides say that Mr. Trump has been especially drawn to cases in which he believes the prosecution may have been politically motivated \u2014 a situation that may remind him of his own position at the center of the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling. Many have also seen the president as sending a signal with his pardons to former aides and associates caught up in the probe, or lashing out at enemies like former FBI Director James Comey, who oversaw the prosecution of lifestyle guru Martha Stewart, whom Trump has said he is thinking of pardoning.",

            "article_content": "MOSCOW -- Russian President Vladimir Putin called his first summit with President Donald Trump a success - but warned Thursday that Trump's opponents in the U.S. are hampering any progress on what they discussed, such as limiting their nuclear arsenals or ending the Syrian war. In his first public comments about the summit, Putin told Russian diplomats that U.S.-Russian relations are \"in some ways worse than during the Cold War,\" but that his meeting with Trump on Monday allowed them to start on \"the path to positive change.\" \"It's naive to think that the problems would be solved in a few hours. But no one expected that,\" Putin said. \"We will see how things develop further,\" Putin said, evoking unnamed \"forces\" in the U.S. trying to prevent any improvement in relations and \"putting narrow party interests above the national interest.\" Putin faces no serious political opposition at home, and leads a country that has never experienced a democratic transfer of power. Trump, by contrast, has come under widespread domestic criticism about the meeting both from Democratic opponents and senior Republicans. A CBS News poll published Thursday showed that only a third of Americans (32 percent) approved of the way Mr. Trump handled the summit with Putin in Helsinki. Sixty-eight percent of Republicans approved. \u00a0 Trump notably flip-flopped repeatedly over what exactly he said to Putin at the summit, and whether he believes that Russia meddled in the 2016 election campaign on Trump's behalf. Trump tweeted Thursday that his critics in the media \"are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I'll probably have a good relationship with Putin.\" The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I\u2019ll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country! In a possible dig at Trump's unpredictable presidency, Putin vaunted Russia's \"consistent, responsible, independent foreign policy.\" Putin had both criticism and praise for Trump in a broad speech about Russian foreign policy. The Russian leader praised Trump's mediation efforts in North Korea, but slammed his decision to pull out of the international accord curbing Iran's nuclear activities. He also lashed out at Europe and U.S.-dominated NATO, saying Russia would hit back with an \"equivalent response\" to NATO bases near Russia's borders and other \"aggressive steps.\" He didn't elaborate. Russian politicians are rallying behind Putin and shrugging off Trump's wildly contradictory accounts of what he said to Putin at Monday's summit. They are angry, however, at proposals by U.S. lawmakers to question Trump's translator about what the men discussed privately. Konstantin Kosachev, head of the upper house of parliament's foreign affairs committee, said the idea sets a dangerous precedent that threats the \"the whole idea of diplomacy,\" according to Russian news agencies.",

            "article_content": "So is this what a trade war looks like? The Trump administration and China's leadership have imposed tens of billions of dollars in tariffs on each other's goods. President Donald Trump has proposed slapping duties on, all told, up to $550 billion if China keeps retaliating and doesn't cave in to U.S. demands to scale back its aggressive industrial policies. Until the past couple of years, tariffs had been losing favor as a tool of national trade policy. They were largely a relic of 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts viewed as mutually harmful to all nations involved. But Trump has restored tariffs to a prominent place in his self-described America First approach. Trump enraged such U.S. allies as Canada, Mexico and the European Union this spring by slapping tariffs on their steel and aluminum shipments to the United States. The tariffs have been in place on most other countries since March. \"America's trade partners appear to be torn between a wish to send a strong message in protest against protectionism and a wish to refrain from taking actions which could exacerbate the conflict,\" wrote Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics, in a research report published on Monday.\u00a0 The president has also asked the U.S. Commerce Department to look into imposing tariffs on imported cars, trucks and auto parts, arguing that they pose a threat to U.S. national security. Here is a look at what tariffs are, how they work, how they've been used in the past and what to expect now: Economists have no set definition of a trade war. But with the world's two largest economies now slapping potentially punishing tariffs on each other, it looks as if a trade war has arrived. All told, Trump has threatened to hit as much as $550 billion worth of China's exports to the U.S. with punitive tariffs. That's more than the $506 billion in goods that China shipped to the United States last year. It's not uncommon for countries \u2014 even close allies \u2014 to fight over trade in specific products. The United States and Canada, for example, have squabbled for decades over softwood lumber. But the U.S. and China are fighting over much broader issues, like China's requirements that American companies share advanced technology to access China's market, and the overall U.S. trade deficit with China. So far, neither side has shown any sign of bending. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They're typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs \u2014 also called duties or levies \u2014 are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country. Proceeds go to the Treasury. The tariff rates are published by the U.S. International Trade Commission in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, which lists U.S. tariffs on everything from dried plantains (1.4 percent) to parachutes (3 percent). Sometimes, the U.S. will impose additional duties on foreign imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies. Most key U.S. trading partners do not have significantly higher average tariffs. According to an analysis by Greg Daco at Oxford Economics, U.S. tariffs on imported goods, adjusted for trade volumes, average 2.4 percent, above Japan's 2 percent and just below the 3 percent for the European Union and 3.1 percent for Canada. The comparable figures for Mexico and China are higher: Both have higher duties that top 4 percent. Trump has complained about the 270 percent duty that Canada imposes on dairy products. But the United States has its own ultra-high tariffs \u2014 168 percent on peanuts and 350 percent on tobacco. Two things: Raise government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition. Before the establishment of the federal income tax in 1913, tariffs were a big money raiser for the U.S. government. From 1790 to 1860, for example, they produced 90 percent of federal revenue, according to \"Clashing Over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy\" by Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College. By contrast, last year tariffs accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue. In the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, the U.S. government collected $34.6 billion in customs duties and fees. The White House Office of Management and Budget expects tariffs to fetch $40.4 billion this year. Tariffs also are meant to increase the price of imports or to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices, like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their products at unfairly low prices. Tariffs discourage imports by making them more expensive. They also reduce competitive pressure on domestic competitors and can allow them to raise prices. Tariffs fell out of favor as global trade expanded after World War II. The formation of the World Trade Organization and the advent of trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement among the U.S., Mexico and Canada reduced tariffs or eliminated them altogether. After years of trade agreements that bound the countries of the world more closely and erased restrictions on trade, a populist backlash has grown against globalization. This was evident in Trump's 2016 election and the British vote that year to leave the European Union \u2014 both surprise setbacks for the free-trade establishment. Critics note that big corporations in rich countries exploited looser rules to move factories to China and other low-wage countries, then shipped goods back to their wealthy home countries while paying low tariffs or none at all. Since China joined the WTO in 2001, the United States has shed 3.1 million factory jobs, though many economists attribute much of that loss not just to trade but to robots and other technologies that replace human workers. Trump campaigned on a pledge to rewrite trade agreements and crack down on China, Mexico and other countries. He blames what he calls their abusive trade policies for America's persistent trade deficits \u2014 $566 billion last year. Most economists, by contrast, say the deficit simply reflects the reality that the United States spends more than it saves. By imposing tariffs, he is beginning to turn his hard-line campaign rhetoric into action. Most economists \u2014 Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro is a notable exception \u2014 say no. The tariffs drive up the cost of imports. And by reducing competitive pressure, they give U.S. producers leeway to raise their prices, too. That's good for those producers \u2014 but bad for almost everyone else. Rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported components. Some U.S. companies that buy steel are complaining that Trump's tariffs put them at a competitive disadvantage. Their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer their products at lower prices. More broadly, economists say trade restrictions make the economy less efficient. Facing less competition from abroad, domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- As a tool of national trade policy, tariffs had long been fading into history, a relic of 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts regarded as mutually harmful to all nations involved. But President Trump has dusted them off in recent months and restored tariffs to a prominent place in his America First approach to the rest of the world. Mr. Trump enraged U.S. allies Canada, Mexico and the European Union last week by slapping tariffs on their steel and aluminum shipments to the United States; most other countries have been paying the tariffs since March. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a generally conciliatory and deferential world leader, called the tariffs \"insulting and unacceptable.\" Mr. Trump has also threatened tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese products to punish Beijing for pressuring U.S. companies to turn over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market. China has vowed to retaliate with tariffs of its own. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is in China for trade talks. Mr. Trump has also asked the U.S. Commerce Department to look into imposing tariffs on imported cars, trucks and auto parts, arguing that they somehow pose a threat to U.S. national security. Mr. Trump has made trade a key part of his platform on the campaign trail and now, in the White House. On Friday, Mr. Trump tweeted in all capital letters, \"FAIR TRADE!\" FAIR TRADE! Here's a look at what tariffs are, how they work, how they've been used in the past and what to expect now: Tariffs are a tax on imports. They're typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller. Say an American retailer buys 100 garden umbrellas from China for $5 apiece, or $500. The U.S. tariff rate for the umbrellas is 6.5 percent for umbrellas. The retailer would have to pay a $32.50 tariff on the shipment, raising the total price from $500 to $532.50. In the United States, tariffs -- also called duties or levies -- are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country. Proceeds go to the Treasury. The tariff rates are published by the U.S. International Trade Commission in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, which lists U.S. tariffs on everything from dried plantains (1.4 percent) to parachutes (3 percent). Sometimes, the U.S. will impose additional duties on foreign imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies. It's not always easy to match a specific product to a specific tariff or to keep up with which products from which countries are facing, say, special anti-dumping duties. \"It's very complicated,\" says John Brew, a trade lawyer at Crowell & Moring LLP. \"The big companies will have staff that this is all they do.\" Two things: Raise government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition. Before the establishment of the federal income tax in 1913, tariffs were a big money raiser for the U.S. government. From 1790 to 1860, for example, they produced 90 percent of federal revenue, according to \"Clashing Over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy\" by Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College. By contrast, last year tariffs accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the U.S. government collected $34.6 billion in customs duties and fees. The White House Office of Management and Budget expects tariffs to fetch $40.4 billion this year. Those tariffs are meant to increase the price of imports or to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices, like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their products at unfairly low prices. For example, Mr. Trump has accused China of \"dumping\" things like washing machines in the U.S. Tariffs discourage imports by making them more expensive. They also reduce competitive pressure on domestic competitors and can allow them to raise prices. Tariffs fell out of favor as global trade expanded after World War II. The global economic is much more interconnected than it once was. The formation of the World Trade Organization and the advent of trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement among the U.S., Mexico and Canada reduced tariffs or eliminated them altogether. The average U.S. tariff is now one of the lowest in the world: 1.6 percent, the same as the European Union's, the Pew Research Center reports. \"A lot of products are either free of duty or at a low rate of duty,\" says Paula Connelly, a trade lawyer in Woburn, Massachusetts. Mr. Trump has ripped into NAFTA as an unfair deal, and the administration has been attempting to renegotiate it for months.\u00a0 After years of trade agreements that bound the countries of the world more closely and erased restrictions on trade, a populist backlash has grown against globalization. This was evident in Mr. Trump's 2016 election and the British vote that year to leave the European Union -- both surprise setbacks for the free-trade establishment. Critics note that big corporations in rich countries exploited looser rules to move factories to China and other low-wage countries, then shipped goods back to their wealthy home countries while paying low tariffs or none at all. Since China joined the WTO in 2001, the United States has shed 3.1 million factory jobs, though many economists attribute much of that loss not to trade but to robots and other technologies that replace human workers. Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to rewrite trade agreements and crack down on China, Mexico and other countries. On the campaign trail, he called NAFTA a \"disaster.\" He blames what he calls their abusive trade policies for America's persistent trade deficits -- $566 billion last year. By imposing tariffs, he is beginning to turn his hard-line campaign rhetoric into action. Most economists \u2014 Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro is a notable exception -- say no. The tariffs drive up the cost of imports. And by reducing competitive pressure, they give U.S. producers leeway to raise their prices, too. That's good for those producers \u2014 but bad for almost everyone else. Even some in Mr. Trump's own party blasted his movement on tariffs this week, after the president suggested he would not exempt ally nations from steel and aluminum tariffs he announced in March. \"I disagree with this decision,\" Speaker of the House Paul Ryan\u00a0said in a statement Thursday. \"Instead of addressing the real problems in the international trade of these products, today's action targets America's allies when we should be working with them to address the unfair trading practices of countries like China,\" Ryan said. \"There are better ways to help American workers and consumers. I intend to keep working with the president on those better options.\" Rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported components. Some U.S. companies that buy steel are complaining that Mr. Trump's tariffs put them at a competitive disadvantage. Their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer their products at lower prices. Critics of the tariffs argue that, even U.S. workers in steel or aluminum who might benefit from better jobs and wages, may have those benefits offset by paying higher prices for products. In 2002, the administration of President George W. Bush slapped tariffs on imported steel. A study financed by steel-consuming businesses found that the tariffs cost 200,000 American jobs in 2002. More broadly, economists say trade restrictions make the economy less efficient. Facing less competition from abroad, domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best.",

            "article_content": "Financial markets were cautious amid pushback from China, the European Union and Japan on trade issues and remarks by President Donald Trump on Thursday expressing doubt that U.S.\u00a0talks with Beijing would succeed. China on Friday\u00a0denied reports it would offer to slash its trade surplus with the U.S. by $200 billion, according to Reuters. Adding to the tensions, the EU told the World Trade Organization it is ready to deploy retaliatory measures against U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, which would include European tariffs on motorcycles and bourbon. And Japan is threatening to go to the WTO to protest the metal tariffs.  Mr. Trump imposed the tariffs in March, arguing that reliance on imported metals posed a threat to America's national security. He exempted the European Union, Canada, and Mexico \u2014 but not Japan \u2014 until June 1. Mr. Trump's remarks yesterday came weeks after he declared that a trade war would be \"easy to win\" and amid reported clashes inside his own trade team as Chinese officials, led by the country's top economic advisor Liu He, were in Washington to negotiate on trade. \u00a0 They also came just as the U.S Trade Representative hearings on at least $50 billion in tariffs conclude as U.S. businesses detailed the costs they fear from an entrenched trade dispute with China. Those hearings are ahead of a May 21 recommendation expected from the Treasury Department on which tariffs to enact. Mr. Trump has also asked for a list of $100 billion more in possible tariffs. The financial and energy industries are likely to be hit hardest by tariffs if they are enacted as laid out in March, according to Standard & Poor's. \"While not directly impacted by President Trump's tariffs, diversified banks and investment banking and brokerage companies are reexamining their business investment and lending decisions due to the levies' potential negative repercussions on economic growth,\" S&P analysts wrote in a recent report. With banks, fund managers are concerned tariffs could lower U.S. economic growth, wages, employment and \"in the long run, and make the U.S. tax burden less progressive,\" the analysts wrote. They cited an estimate\u00a0from the conservative Tax Foundation that show $37.5 billion in tariffs might cut U.S. employment levels by the equivalent of 79,000 fewer full-time jobs. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs enacted earlier this year have already dealt a \"significant blow\" to the U.S. energy sector, S&P said, citing industry participants' heavy use of steel and aluminum for pipeline construction, wind and solar power installation, and other projects. Signs suggest that\u00a0tariffs and other countries' countermeasures\u00a0-- including proposed duties and those already imposed -- also are hitting other U.S. industries, some in areas of the country that voted for Mr. Trump in the 2016 election. The U.S. has more to lose in a trade war than China, the S&P analysts said. \"Companies have already started to examine the potential impact to their supply chains and are reevaluating the way they conduct business,\" they wrote.\u00a0 That impact is also hitting U.S. farmers. China has already canceled shipments of soy from U.S. farmers and is buying record amounts of soybeans from Russia, Bloomberg reported. With U.S. trade negotiations reaching a critical juncture, here are other key issues in play: NAFTA. The U.S., Mexico and Canada likely missed House Speaker Paul Ryan's \"soft\" May 17 deadline for a final deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. On Friday, some members of Congress urged the Trump administration not to abandon negotiations even as United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer warned the three nations are \"nowhere near close to a deal,\" according to Bloomberg. Missing Ryan's deadline isn't \"fatal,\" though an agreement anytime soon is unlikely, analysts from Oxford Economics said in a research note. Congress could still vote on a deal before they adjourn at the end of the May, but any further delay means a vote on a revised NAFTA might not come before 2019.\u00a0 Metal tariffs. U.S. talks with the EU over the steel and aluminum tariffs \"have turned into a standoff, with both sides now digging in their heels\" as Europe prepares retaliatory measures, Oxford analysts wrote. EU leaders this week called on the Trump administration to stop threatening it with metal tariffs, adding it's prepared to discuss new trade incentives.\u00a0 \"It's Europe's economic sovereignty, and what we are demanding is that we are exempted without conditions or time limits,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said in Bulgaria May 17, where EU leaders gathered for a summit with Balkans countries.\u00a0 CFIUS. Congress is drafting legislation to more stringently regulate foreign investment in U.S. companies, including from China. The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to mark up its version of the bill, known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, or FIRRMA, on May 22, seeking to hone the legislation before it moves to the full Senate for a vote.\u00a0 The measures aim to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, a panel that reviews cross-border mergers for their impact on U.S. national security.\u00a0 -- The Associated Press contributed to this report\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Barbara Bush, former first lady of George H.W. Bush, died Tuesday according to a statement made by the office of George H.W. Bush. She was the second woman in U.S. history to be a first lady and mother of a president. Barbara Bush was 92. In a previous statement Sunday, the family said Barbara had decided not to seek additional medical treatment and instead sought comfort care at home for unspecified health complications.\u00a0 \"My dear mother has passed on at age 92. Laura, Barbara, Jenna, and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was. Barbara Bush was a fabulous First Lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love, and literacy to millions,\" former president George W. Bush wrote in a statement Tuesday night.\u00a0 The statement continued, \"To us, she was so much more. Mom kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end. I'm a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother. Our family will miss her dearly, and we thank you all for your prayers and good wishes. Jean Becker, the chief of staff to Mr. Bush, gave up an update that the former president is \"heartbroken.\"\u00a0 \"He held her hand all day today and was by her side when she left this good earth,\" Becker's statement read. \"Obviously this is a very challenging time. But it will not surprise all of you who know and love him, that he is also being stoic and strong, and is being lifted up by his large and supportive family.\"\u00a0  \u00a0 Members of the public are invited to pay their respects Friday, April 20 as Barbara Bush lay in repose between 12 p.m. and midnight at St. Martin's Church in Houston, according to the official funeral announcement\u00a0by the family. The funeral service is by invite only. Bush spent her life in public service, but she never wavered from her belief that being a wife and mother was her greatest contribution to society. \"No, I'm the mother of wonderful children. And the wife of the world's greatest man,\" she told Norah O'Donnell on \"CBS This Morning\" in 2016 when O'Donnell described her as beloved.  And despite her lifelong devotion to the Republican party, she was not afraid to hit back and defend her family when then-candidate Donald Trump went after her son, Jeb, who was also seeking the Republican nomination. Bush expressed disbelief about some of the things then-candidate Trump had said about women. \"I mean, unbelievable. I don't know how women can vote for someone who said what he said about Megyn Kelly,\" she said. \"And we knew what he meant too!\" Barbara Pierce was born in Rye, New York, near the Connecticut border in 1925, the third child of Pauline and Marvin Pierce, a magazine executive. When she was 16, she met George Herbert Walker Bush at a school dance in Greenwich, Connecticut. After several months of courtship, George Bush invited her to his senior prom.  \"After the dance, [he] walked me home and, in front of the world, leaned down and kissed me on the cheek,\" Barbara Bush wrote in her 1994 memoir. \"I floated into my room and kept the poor girl I was rooming with awake all night while I made her listen to how Poppy Bush was the greatest living human on the face of the Earth.\" In 1943, George Bush became the Navy's youngest pilot while Barbara enrolled in Smith College. The couple exchanged letters over the course of George's deployment in the Pacific, until one day Barbara received a letter from another pilot saying George's plane had been shot down. For three days, George's fate was unclear, but eventually the Navy alerted Barbara that he had in fact survived. Two of his fellow crewmates, however, did not. The couple wed on Jan. 6, 1945, and would go on to have four sons -- George W., Jeb, Marvin and Neil -- a daughter, Doro, 17 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. But their family life was also touched by tragedy: The Bush family's second child, Robin, died in 1953 at the age of three after a battle with leukemia. Bush recalled on the \"Today\" show in 2016 that doctors said \"My advice is take her home, love her. In about two weeks she'll be gone.\" But instead they took her a New York City hospital, where doctors treated her aggressively and added seven months to her life. \"I was combing her hair and holding her hand,\" Bush told \"Today.\" \"I saw that little body, I saw her spirit go.\" Thirty-six years later, Bush cried when discussing the decision she made to try an aggressive surgery to prolong Robin's life, according to Vanity Fair. Bush was only 28 years old when her daughter died, but the ordeal turned her hair white. She told \"Today\" that Robin is who her husband \"will see first\" when he dies.  As a young couple, the Bush's moved to Texas, where George Bush built his oil business. A millionaire before the age of 40, George Bush was a Goldwater Republican and was elected as the chairman of the Harris County Republican Party in 1963. Barbara Bush began her life as a political wife by visiting all 189 precincts in Harris County, Texas to support his bid.  George Bush lost his first bid for Congress in 1964 but his luck change din 1966. At the time, with Texan Lyndon Johnson occupying the White House and the Democratic political machine controlling Austin, Bush became the first Republican congressman to be elected from Texas since Reconstruction. His home county, Harris County, has not elected a Republican to Congress since.  Their quiet life in Texas changed as the family headed to Washington, D.C. -- one of numerous moves that Barbara Bush organized during their marriage, including one to Beijing, so he could represent the U.S. as ambassador to China. \u00a0\u00a0 George Bush first ran for president in 1980. During the primaries, Barbara Bush made headlines for throwing her support behind the continuous Equal Rights Amendment and saying she agreed with Roe v. Wade. After George Bush lost the Republican nomination and joined Ronald Reagan's ticket, she distanced herself from earlier headlines. As the second lady, Barbara Bush focused on literacy as her signature issue and solidified her reputation for baking cookies, knitting and as America's grandmother. But another side could sometimes slip out: During the 1984 election, she referred to Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro as the \"that $4 million\u2014I can't say it, but it rhymes with 'rich.'\" She later apologized for the remark with a personal phone call. Her husband successfully won the presidency in 1988 and Bush ascended to the role as first lady. In 1989, as the AIDS virus terrified Americans, Bush took the press corps with her to visit a residence for HIV-infected babies. With the cameras clicking away, she hugged a 20-month old who recently had been diagnosed with AIDS. \"You can hug and pick up AIDS babies and people who have the HIV virus\" without hurting yourself, she she said. \"There is a need for compassion.\" It was a moment that defined her time as first lady.  \"In the thirty-some years I've been around American politics, she's far and away the greatest political spouse I've seen,\" says political strategist Edward J. Rollins, one of the managers of Ross Perot's campaign, told Vanity Fair in 1992. During her time at the White House, the former first lady's signature cause was family literacy focusing on bringing awareness to early childhood education and adult literacy for parents. She later launched the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy during her husband's presidency. \"I honestly believe that if more people could read, write and comprehend, we would be that much closer to solving so many of the problems that plague our nation,\" she said in a 1990 speech.  The 1992 election pitted George and Barbara Bush, members of the Greatest Generation, against Baby Boomers Bill and Hillary Clinton. Voters chose the younger generation, dealing a personal blow to the Bushes.  Following their time in politics, the couple would later call Kennebunkport, Maine, one of their homes during their retirement years, dividing time between the Bush compound in the coastal town and their home in Houston, Texas.  But a political family had been born. Their oldest son, George W. Bush, defeated Democrat Ann Richards to become Texas Governor in 1994 -- and Democrats have not managed to win back the statehouse since. He went on to win the presidency in 2000 and managed a feat his father hadn't by winning a second term in 2004. Another son, Jeb Bush, became the 43rd governor of Florida in 1999. Ever the political animal, Bush campaigned with Jeb in 2016 in his bid for the Republican nomination. But perhaps Americans heeded his mother's own words when she said the country had \"had enough Bushes,\" because he won not a single state in the 2016 primary. Although maybe not: Her 38-year-old grandson, George P. Bush, was elected Texas land commissioner in May 2018, leading many to speculate he could go on to higher offices.  In 2016, Jeb told Norah O'Donnell on \"CBS This Morning\" that his mother provided him with \"unconditional love.\"",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump tweeted this week the U.S.-Russia relationship is \"worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War.\" CBS News' Alex Wagner traveled to Moscow for the new season of the Showtime series \"The Circus,\" to see how the younger generation of Russians views the tensions. They told her what they thought about the so-called \"new Cold War\" between Washington and Moscow, and their opinions of Americans. When asked the first word that pops into their minds for \"America,\" the first answer was \"Trump.\" But then, a flurry of others:\u00a0 Aerosmith. McDonalds. Star and Stripes. Liberty. Comic books. Pop culture. \"Those are pretty positive or happy images of America,\" said Wagner, \"and yet in the news today we read that America and Russia are in a new Cold War.\" \"I totally disagree with that,\" said Kirill. \"I don't think that's right to isolate ourselves from the outer world, especially from America, because America is one of the leading countries in the world.\" Maria said, \"My point of view is like, those are just wonderful topics for journalists, [and] that's it.\" \"The political decisions that are made right now, they are destructive for all spheres of our life,\" said David. Both countries, he felt, \"are led by very aggressively-oriented people.\" Wagner asked, \"Do you think one side is more to blame than the other?\" \"Both sides are to be blamed,\" he replied.  Evgeni said, \"I respect Trump, he does his job. I respect Putin, he does his job. But I do my job,\" which is not, he said, to be \"an expert in politics.\"  Wagner asked David what most intrigued him about the United States.  \"A lot of media says that we have this huge propaganda in Russia, maybe it's true, but I think the surprising thing for me is that American people are more vulnerable to any kind of even small propaganda. For example, if I look at your camera and say, 'I live in Russia and I just love Putin because he's the greatest Communist of all time,' your audience is gonna go, like, 'Oh my God, Communists, so terrible. Poor Russia!' But I know for sure that Russia is not a Communist country at all.\" Ademi did not believe reports from the American press that the Russians had anything to do with the U.S. presidential election: \"That sounds really funny to me. I don't think that Russia would have done that.\" Artem, meanwhile, did not have a positive view of the press: \"I don't think that it's the job of the media nowadays to say the truth. It's mostly emotional ... and to react to the media from other media from all over the world.\"\u00a0  Wagner asked, \"So, do you feel that's true for Russian media as well?\" \"Yes, exactly.\" Their opinions regarding Russian President Vladimir Putin are mixed -- from feeling that he's becoming \"a bit inadequate\" and doesn't understand what he wants (\"This is frightening for such a level of authority,\" said Mira), to Kirill saying that \"I disagree with him on many points, but mostly satisfied with the current political system.\" The Russian millennials do differentiate themselves from older Russians.  \"The people who were born in the Soviet Union, they didn't have a chance to travel around the world,\" Kirill said. \"We had this chance because the borders are open and the Western pop culture coming to us.\" And they do not feel isolated form the world.  \"We still got YouTube,\" said Evgeni. \"We watch CBS, we watch Marvel, we watch HBO, our favorite series, like 'Game of Thrones,' right? No, you cannot isolate us, because we've got money and we can grab a ticket and visit you if we want. But we're okay here, for serious.\"",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is abandoning plans to keep U.S. troops in Syria long term, pushing for a quick military withdrawal over a prolonged effort to stabilize the country and prevent the Islamic State group from re-emerging. Mr. Trump has signaled to his advisers that ideally, he wants all troops out within six months, according to three U.S. officials \u2014 a finale that would come shortly before the U.S. midterm elections. But Mr. Trump has given no formal order to pull out the 2,000 U.S. troops currently in Syria, nor offered a public timetable, other than to say the United States will pull out just as soon as the last remaining IS fighters can be vanquished. In his haste to withdraw from Syria, Mr. Trump stands alone. The Pentagon, the State Department and CIA are all deeply concerned about the potential ramifications if the U.S. leaves behind a power vacuum in Syria, as are Israel, Arab leaders and other nations in the U.S.-led coalition that has fought IS in Iraq and Syria since 2014. The president made clear his patience was running out as he met top national security aides on Tuesday. Yet the meeting concluded with no hard-and-fast deadline handed down, leaving Mr. Trump's team struggling to deduce how fast is fast enough for Mr. Trump, according to officials briefed on the meeting who weren't authorized to discuss it and requested anonymity. The tense disagreement between Mr. Trump and his team has played out in chaotic and increasingly public fashion. On Tuesday, before the Syria meeting, Mr. Trump was telling television cameras he wanted to \"get out,\" just as the U.S. special envoy for fighting IS insisted \"our mission isn't over.\" And on Wednesday, the White House issued a statement that declared the IS mission is \"coming to a rapid end\" but avoided specifics altogether. \"We will continue to consult with our allies and friends regarding future plans,\" said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Urging him to slow down, Mr. Trump's aides have been emphasizing that IS fighters remain active in Syria, evidence that Mr. Trump's own, publicly stated objective \u2014 the total defeat of IS \u2014 has yet to be met. Officials said the U.S. is tracking two pockets where IS remains viable \u2014 one in the Middle Euphrates Valley Region, another along the Iraq-Syria border. And despite the White House's insistence that the group is \"almost completely defeated,\" a string of renewed IS attacks in recent weeks has raised fears about a resurgence. Regardless of exactly when the troops leave, the decision to remove them as soon as possible has forced an immediate realignment of long-term U.S. objectives in the country, officials said. With no military presence to ensure security for American personnel, the U.S. will have to call off other planned operations to clear land mines, restore basic services like water and electricity, and create political conditions needed to resolve Syria's civil war. Already, Mr. Trump has put an indefinite hold on $200 million he pledged previously for those operations. Those efforts by U.S. diplomats and aid workers have been seen as critical to ensuring that Syria's territory isn't exploited in the future by IS remnants, other extremists or Iran. They formed a key component of Mr. Trump's new Syria strategy, laid out by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a speech in January declaring it \"vital for the United States to remain engaged in Syria.\" But the speech, while formally approved by the White House, angered Mr. Trump, officials said, and the president fired Tillerson last month. Instead, Mr. Trump will leave stabilizing Syria to other nations, in line with his long-stated view that the United States shoulders too much of global costs and should put \"America first.\" \"I want to get out,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I want to bring our troops back home. I want to start rebuilding our nation.\" Mr. Trump has asked Saudi Arabia, which is keenly interested in keeping Iran out of Syria, to contribute $4 billion toward reconstruction and stabilization efforts that the U.S. no longer plans to undertake. He came away from a phone call Monday with King Salman confident that the king will agree to give the money, two U.S. officials briefed on the conversation said. The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment. Securing foreign dollars while pulling out troops could allow Trump to argue before the November midterms that he's shifted the burden of resolving far-flung crises away from America. But ceding influence over Syrian territory could hand more control to countries whose interests in the Middle East are sharply at odds with the United States. As the White House was talking up a U.S. withdrawal on Wednesday, the leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran were meeting in Ankara to hash out their own plans for Syria's future, including a continued Turkish operation to oust U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters from northern Syria. The three nations have been pushing their own diplomatic track for resolving Syria's civil war, even as the U.S. tries to rejuvenate United Nations-led talks. \"We have agreed to expand the entire range of our trilateral cooperation in Syria,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said in the Turkish capital, claiming credit on the trio's behalf for the Islamic State group's near-defeat. Russia has been propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad for years, with increasing help from Iranian-backed Shiite militias such as Hezbollah \u2014 to the dismay of U.S. allies such as Israel. A phone call Wednesday between Mr. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu grew tense because of the Israeli leader's concerns that the U.S. will withdraw and allow Israel's enemies to gain a further foothold in a neighboring country, two U.S. officials said. Nor is it clear that the U.S. has capable local partners lined up to handle basic security and prevent a total collapse following a precipitous U.S. pullout \u2014 a prospect that offers unsettling echoes of the 2011 U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. As a candidate, Mr. Trump derided President Barack Obama for that decision and argued that the resulting power vacuum enabled the formation of the Islamic State. The Syrian Kurds, the most effective fighting force in Syria aligned with Washington, recently shifted to fighting Turkish forces in the area of Afrin. That forced a pause in operations against the main IS holdout in Syria. The Pentagon has warned that the distraction could give IS the reprieve it needs to regroup after four years of being pummeled.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration expelled 60 Russian diplomats on Monday and ordered Russia's consulate in Seattle to close, as the United States and European nations sought to jointly punish Moscow for its alleged role in poisoning an ex-spy in Britain.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Senior Trump administration officials said all 60 Russians were spies working in the U.S. under diplomatic cover, including a dozen at Russia's mission to the United Nations. The officials said the administration was taking the action to send a message to Russia's leaders about the \"unacceptably high\" number of Russian intelligence operatives in the U.S. The White House made the announcement in a statement early Monday morning: \"Today President Donald J. Trump ordered the expulsion of dozens of Russian intelligence officers from the United States and the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle due to its proximity to one of our submarine bases and Boeing. The United States takes this action in conjunction with our NATO allies and partners around the world in response to Russia's use of a military-grade chemical weapon on the soil of the United Kingdom, the latest in its ongoing pattern of destabilizing activities around the world. Today's actions make the United States safer by reducing Russia's ability to spy on Americans and to conduct covert operations that threaten America's national security. With these steps, the United States and our allies and partners make clear to Russia that its actions have consequences. The United States stands ready to cooperate to build a better relationship with Russia, but this can only happen with a change in the Russian government's behavior.\" Shortly after the announcement, State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement on that \"The United States calls on Russia to accept responsibility for its actions and to demonstrate to the world that it is capable of living up to its international commitments and responsibilities as a member of the UN Security Council to uphold international peace and security.\" Nauert added of the punishment for Russia's \"destabilizing behavior\" that the U.S. \"takes these actions to demonstrate our unbreakable solidarity with the United Kingdom, and to impose serious consequences on Russia for its continued violations of international norms.\" Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's top U.N. diplomat Nikki Haley sent a statement saying that twelve intelligence operatives from the Russian Mission to the United Nations have abused their privilege of residence in the United States, CBS News' Pamela Falk reports.\u00a0 \"Here in New York, Russia uses the United Nations as a safe haven for dangerous activities within our own borders, \" Ambassador Haley said.\u00a0 The expelled Russians will have seven days to leave the U.S, said the officials. They weren't authorized to be identified by name and requested anonymity. They added that the Seattle consulate is a counter-intelligence concern because of its proximity to a U.S. Navy base. The move was one of the most significant actions Mr. Trump's administration has taken to date to push back on Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Less than a week ago, Mr. Trump congratulated Putin by phone for his re-election but didn't raise the spy case, renewing questions about whether the U.S. president is too soft on the Kremlin. The Russians preemptively responded to threats of the expected expulsion through a series of social media messages. Russia's Embassy in the United States tweeted late Sunday night, \"Strategic stability of the entire world depends on Russia-US relations. They should not be taken hostage by clearly staged stories.\" Help London. Calm Downing Street.Strategic stability of the entire world depends on Russia\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8US relations. They should not be taken hostage by clearly staged stories.\u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/YNqGgM89xY pic.twitter.com/ju849lRoym The embassy added that the Trump administration still had \"time\" to change their minds on following through with such actions, which they said would \"prevent negative aftermath of this fake story from happening for the sake of all little positivity left in the Russian-American relations.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The embassy then issued a follow-up tweet after the president's order -- appearing to suggest a retaliatory closure of a U.S. consulate in Russia, and asking for the public's help in choosing which one. US administration\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 ordered the closure of the Russian Consulate in Seattle @GK_Seattle\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa. What US Consulate General would you close in @Russia, if it was up to you to decide The U.S. actions came as more than a dozen nations, including those in Russia's neighborhood, were expected to announce similar steps to reduce Russia's diplomatic presence in their countries or other actions to punish Moscow. Poland summoned Russia's ambassador for talks, and its foreign ministry was among several in Europe planning news conferences later Monday. Last week, EU chief Donald Tusk predicted that member states would introduce measures against Moscow over its suspected role in the spy poisoning case. Tusk tweeted Monday in response that 14 EU Members States had decided to also expel Russian diplomats. \"Additional measures including further expulsions are not excluded in coming days, weeks,\" he added. Today 14 EU Member States decided to expel Russian diplomats as direct follow-up to #EUCO discussion last week on #SalisburyAttack. Additional measures including further expulsions are not excluded in coming days, weeks. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Britain has already expelled 23 Russian diplomats, accusing them of being undeclared intelligence agents, which led Russia to expel the same number of British diplomats. The European Union has already recalled its ambassador to Russia. Britain has accused Moscow of perpetrating the attack. The U.S., France and Germany have agreed it's highly likely that's the case.",

            "article_content": "CAIRO --\u00a0A bomb placed under a nearby car exploded Saturday in the coastal city of Alexandria as the city security chief's convoy passed by, killing two policemen and wounding four others, the Interior Ministry said. Local media reports said Gen. Mostafa al-Nimr survived the explosion and he was seen on a local TV channel in good condition while inspecting the area of the blast shortly after it took place. The Interior Ministry had earlier reported only one policeman killed in the blast which occurred in the vicinity of a police station in the city's central Roshdi district. Health Ministry spokesman Khaled Megahed told The Associated Press that two policemen were killed and four others wounded in today's explosion, adding that one civilian was also wounded. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Residents close to the clean said they heard a loud blast Saturday morning. \"I suddenly heard a very strong explosion and ran towards the street, but I retreated out of fear,\" Mohamed Ismail told Reuters news agency. \"I thought the building would collapse and kept checking on its pillars.\" The attack comes just days ahead of Egypt's presidential election, in which President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is virtually certain to be re-elected. It also comes during a massive security operation involving land, sea and air forces in areas covering north and central Sinai and parts of Egypt's Nile Delta and the Western Desert, along the porous border with Libya. The Interior Ministry said the explosive device had been placed under a car and it detonated as the convoy passed by. State-run MENA news agency said the public prosecutor has ordered an investigation into the incident. Egypt has for years been struggling to contain an insurgency spearheaded by a local affiliate of the extremist Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the turbulent Sinai region but attacks on the mainland have also occurred. The country has been under a state of emergency since April 2017, when suicide bombings struck two Coptic Christian churches in Alexandria and Tanta on Palm Sunday in an attack claimed later by the Islamic State group.",

            "article_content": "President Trump consumed Thursday morning's TV headlines with amusement. Reports of tumult in the administration were at a feverish pitch \u2014 even on his beloved Fox News \u2014 as the president reflected on the latest staff departures during an Oval Office conversation with Vice President Mike Pence and Chief of Staff John Kelly. With a laugh, Mr. Trump said: \"Who's next?\" It's the very question that has the whole White House on edge. In recent weeks, the president's top economic adviser has resigned over a policy dispute, the secretary of state he long clashed with was fired and a slew of top aides headed for the exits. An increasingly confident Mr. Trump is privately weighing still more changes, expressing frustration with certain advisers and sifting through possible replacements. Many close to Mr. Trump think more upheaval is coming soon. The president is moving toward replacing national security adviser H.R. McMaster, but has not settled on exact timing or a successor, said four people with knowledge of White House deliberations. Kelly has also worn on the president, confidants of the president said. And Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, under fire for ethics violations, appears to be grasping to keep his job. So intense was the swirl of speculation about McMaster that White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to tamp things down late Thursday by tweeting: \"Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster - contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC.\" This account of the tensions in the White House is based on conversations with 10 officials inside the White House and familiar with West Wing deliberations, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters. After more than 14 months in office, Mr. Trump is reshaping his administration, seeking people more likely to fall in line with his policies and tolerate his moods. The factionalism that defined the early days of his tenure has faded and he has lost some of the close aides who could manage his volatile impulses. To some, the White House is increasing taking on the feel of a team of cheerleaders more than a team of rivals. While dismissing news reports of looming departures, Trump also appeared to signal more changes to come on Thursday, telling reporters: \"There will always be change.\" Mr. Trump's administration has set records for turnover among senior administration aides. Top economic adviser Gary Cohn and communications director Hope Hicks are leaving the White House in coming weeks. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was just unceremoniously ousted, on Twitter. And junior-level aides were particularly troubled by the abrupt exit of Mr. Trump's personal assistant John McEntee this week, who was removed from his job and escorted off White House grounds \u2014 then quickly handed a job on Mr. Trump's re-election campaign. In private conversations in recent weeks with aides and friends, Mr. Trump has reflected on his desire to reshape the administration. Though the drumbeat of the ongoing Russia probe has only grown louder, the president believes that his recent decisions on tariffs and North Korea have breathed new life into his administration, and he is eager to take more \"bold steps\" that make his own mark. He has told confidants he wants to rid himself of staffers who hold him back. Mr. Trump chafes at McMaster's demeanor, complaining that his aide lectures him, according to three current and former administration officials. Officials said McMaster has been sidelined in some internal discussions, with Kelly taking on a more active role in foreign policy decisions, because of the personal tensions. The president and McMaster have disagreed on a number of issues \u2014 including the Iran deal and the U.S. approach to North Korea \u2014 and the national security adviser has also clashed with Kelly and Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to the officials. McMaster, in turn, is not a natural fit for the scattershot policy-making process in the White House and dislikes the internal rivalries that so often divide the West Wing. He was the target of online attacks from the fringes of the right wing last summer, including for his alleged insufficient support of Israel. During an earlier round of Trump discontent with his national security adviser, there was White House talk of providing McMaster, a three-star general, with a soft landing by giving him a fourth star along with a command in a priority area such as Afghanistan or Korea, according to a former senior administration official. Kelly has been credited with imposing order on the chaotic West Wing, but his relationship with Mr. Trump has come under strain too. Mr. Trump was said to be deeply irritated and to have considered firing Kelly over the negative publicity surrounding his handling of the controversy over ousted White House aide Rob Porter, who was accused of domestic abuse. The president also recently told an ally that he was still frustrated by an interview that Kelly gave to Fox News nearly two months ago in which he suggested that Trump had \"evolved\" in his thinking about the need for a wall on the Mexican border. At least one of Mr. Trump's \"generals\" \u2014 the collection of military advisers he used to boast about \u2014 remains largely in good standing. The president is said to remain pleased with Mattis, as the defense secretary rarely publicly disagrees with Mr. Trump and has succeeded in quietly working through any differences, according to three White House officials and outside advisers. Mr. Trump has expressed frustration with aides whom he believes try to \"manage\" him according to several current and former White House officials \u2014 and has grown tired of efforts by his staff to stall controversial actions they disagree with. Trump, the officials said, wants a lively discussion \u2014 he often talks about enjoying conflict among his aides \u2014 but has grown irritated that some try to undermine his decisions. As the president reshapes his administration, those who are taking over some of the vacated administration jobs tend to have closer ties to the president and signal more willingness to buy into his ways. Trump's nominee to be the next secretary of state \u2014CIA director Mike Pompeo \u2014 is a longtime favorite of the president who has demonstrated rare ability to navigate the West Wing. A campaign supporter of Mr. Trump's, Pompeo developed a strong personal relationship with the president by regularly attending his daily intelligence briefing. And Mr. Trump has known his pick to replace Cohn for decades. He's CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow, who opposes taxing foreign imports, yet still says he's \"in accord\" with Trump's agenda.",

            "article_content": "LONDON -- Britain offers wealthy Russians many attractions: the great city of London, the bucolic countryside, exclusive schools, and a global financial hub. But for some former spies and other foes of President Vladimir Putin, it has become lethal.\u00a0 The latest victims near death's door are 66-year-old Sergei Skripal -- a former colonel in Russia's military intelligence service, then a turncoat helping British agents -- and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia. Both were found comatose on a public bench Sunday in the medieval English city of Salisbury. British officials say they were exposed to a rare nerve agent of undetermined origin. Their prognosis is unclear; officials have not said if they have suffered irreversible damage. On Saturday, military personnel removed an ambulance that may have been contaminated in the poisoning of the former Russian spy, CBS News' Roxana Saberi reports.\u00a0 British Home Secretary Amber Ruud said Saturday the investigation is making progress.\u00a0 \"There's over 200 witnesses involved and there's over 240 pieces of evidence,\" Ruud said. \"So we need to give the police and all the investigative parts around them the space to get on with that.\" British police are reviewing hours of CCTV footage from Sunday, including new images that show what appears to be a man and a younger woman walking together as another woman with a dog passes them. Minutes later, a police car speeds by toward the area where Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found on a park bench unconscious. The daughter's childhood friend, Irina Petrova, said she remembers the victims as the \"perfect family.\" She told BBC News that Yulia didn't do \"anything to deserve\" being targeted and said it seems like friends of the family are afraid to speak out. \"I'm starting to get scared,\" Petrova told BBC News. \"No one wants to speak -- even her relatives.\" Some in Britain say the nerve agent attack fits a pattern of suspicious Russian-related deaths in the U.K. and in the United States, and are calling for a high level police investigation into whether Britain has become a killing ground for the state-sanctioned elimination of foes of the Russian government. The brazen assault has not been formally blamed on the Russian government, but it is raising hard questions on how to deal with Russia's increasingly aggressive stance -- even as officials in the U.S. are trying to determine how to respond to Russian interference in U.S. elections. Several politicians, analysts and intelligence agencies believe the case of Skripal, who moved to Britain after he was freed in 2010, may prove to be the work of the Russian government, Russian organized crime groups, or a fluid alliance of the two. \"Russian leaders seem to go out of their way to get rid of anybody that seems to be in their way, someone who's betrayed them, someone who's interrupting the money flow, and they don't seem to care about borders, they just go wherever they have to go to get their guy,\" said Joe Serio, the American author of \"Investigating the Russian Mafia,\" who spent nearly 10 years with the anti-organized crime unit of Moscow's police. \"Britain happens to be one of the central places where Russians flee. It's the gateway to the West, the seat of the language, the seat of the empire, the seat of major finance,\" he said. Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs committee in Parliament that reviews police and intelligence matters, and Ian Blair, former head of the Metropolitan Police that is spearheading the inquiry, both said this week that a string of unexplained deaths must be investigated in light of the latest attack. Cooper cited a BuzzFeed News investigation into 14 deaths that may have been the result of foul play. \"No attempt on an innocent life on British soil should go uninvestigated or unpunished,\" said Cooper, who called for the National Crime Agency to scrutinize the 14 deaths in light of reports that U.S. intelligence officials believe they may be linked to Russia \u2014 even though British police have not reached the same conclusion in most cases. There was also a chilling message from Moscow in the days after the attack on Skripal, delivered by a Russian state television news anchorman who warned potential double agents they should expect a shortened life span in Britain. \"Alcoholism, drug addiction, stress and depression are inevitable professional illnesses of a traitor resulting in heart attacks and even suicide,\" Kirill Kleimenov said. He didn't mention nerve agents -- or radioactive poisons, like the one used against former spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 -- as other possible risk factors. The Litvinenko case is the best documented. The former KGB agent who had defected to Britain and publicly criticized Putin died in November 2006, three weeks after drinking tea containing the radioactive isotope polonium-210. Litvinenko died slowly, with the poison transforming him into a stick-thin figure wasting away on a hospital bed, and he blamed Putin shortly before he died. A decade later, a laborious public inquiry concluded he had been killed by Russia's security service, \"probably\" with Putin's approval. Less clear is the 2013 demise of Boris Berezovsky, an affluent Russian businessman who moved to Britain in the early 2000s after breaking with Putin. He was an outspoken critic of Putin's policies, and at times was allied with Litvinenko, until he was found dead on a bathroom floor at his home in southern England. He had a scarf around his neck, leading many to think he had taken his own life, but after an inquest the coroner concluded it was not possible to establish beyond a reasonable doubt whether the oligarch was killed or committed suicide. There are also serious doubts about the 2012 death of Alexander Perepilichny, a Russian businessman who provided vital testimony against Russian officials accused of stealing $230 million from a London hedge fund. He died near his rented home while jogging. Two autopsies were inconclusive, with no obvious signs of foul play, but colleagues suspect he may have been poisoned with a rare, difficult-to-detect plant. A coroner's inquest is underway but no cause of death has been established. Unusual deaths have also taken place outside of Britain. The 2015 death of former Putin aide Mikhail Lesin in a Washington hotel room was officially blamed by the District of Columbia's chief medical examiner on accidental injuries suffered after days of heavy drinking, but officials never explained how he got the blunt force injuries to his head and body. The military-backed investigation of the Skripal case has transformed the pleasant city of Salisbury into a major crime scene. Specialist police in oversize yellow hazardous material gear are searching for clues, and forensics tents have been erected over suspicious areas -- including the gravesite of Skripal's son, who died last year. The goals are to remove any vestiges of the nerve agent that might threaten the public, determine what specific nerve agent was used and -- even more important -- where it might have been manufactured. That could go a long way toward determining if the crime indeed has Russian origins or if the early speculation is off base. Serio, who worked with Moscow police, said it may turn out that the Russian government was not directly involved. \"I've seen many dramatic situations like these where, after the dust settles, it comes down to business interests, whether that business is contracts and money or information and spying,\" he said. \"I'd start with Skripal's activities. Was he involved in business, private security, intelligence-related matters? Was he doing private consulting for companies? It's either betrayal, politics, or you're messing with my money,\" he said. \"These guys are relentless.\" If the forensic evidence provides indisputable proof of Russian government involvement, Britain will have to make good on public vows to punish Russia made by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and other senior figures. But the arsenal at Prime Minister Theresa May's disposal is limited, in part because promising relations between the two countries soured after the Litvinenko case and Russia's intervention in Ukraine. \"I'm not sure there are a lot of clear options for the U.K. government on this,\" said Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House think tank. \"Expulsion of diplomats. No Prince William at the World Cup in Russia. Some lobbying with the European Union, making political capital, saying this is why you need sanctions in place.\" He does not believe British police and courts have been lax. Instead, he said the Russians have been effective in a crackdown on former agents who cooperate with British intelligence. \"The Russian have been very good at covering their tracks,\" he said. \"A lot of this stuff is really difficult to prove. And if you don't have clear evidence, what's the point of going into court?",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump's two grown sons arrived at this tranquil, rural upstate New York hamlet with a bang. A company tied to Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump owns a 171-acre hunting preserve that is being used as a private shooting range, where the sound of rifle fire from a wooden tower and exploding targets has riled nearby residents, neighbors told The Associated Press. One neighbor complained that it rattles the windows of his home; another said it ruins the serenity of the surrounding woods. A third confronted the property's representative over the summer. \"It's like you're in a war zone,\" said Elisabetta Berghold, who lives on 42 acres down the road from the Trumps' land. Neighbors said that while they knew there would be occasional rifle fire from deer hunting on the property, the thunderous noise from target practice on a stretch of land closest to other neighbors was unexpected and unwelcome. \"It's bad. It shakes the windows,\" said neighbor Mike Dougherty. Four neighbors interviewed by the AP described the shooting. All said it had become less frequent in recent months but peaked on summer weekends. The de facto shooting range is located on a strip of land on the easternmost border of the Trumps' property, an easement that was cleared of trees years ago for an AT&T Inc. cable. A wooden tower on that stretch is visible from the public road. The Trumps appear to have acquired the property via limited liability companies that contain some version of the property's address in their names but do not reveal the Trumps' connections. LLCs are often used to buy property or conduct business in ways that obscure the people behind the transactions. The entity that purchased the land in 2013, Leather Hill Preserve LLC, lists its agent as a Manhattan company that provides registration services to LLCs across the country. Incorporation records filed with the state show that the LLC's articles of organization were filed by a Trump Organization executive based out of Trump Tower and that Trump Jr. designated himself in July 2013 as the company's authorized person. In disclosure reports filed with New York City and obtained by the AP under a public records request, Trump Jr. lists himself as the owner of \"DT Leather Hill Road LLC\" and Eric Trump lists himself as the owner of \"194 Leather Hill Road LLC.\" A money manager from Connecticut, Jeffrey Ferraro, is listed as the company's organizer and in sales records as a representative for the LLC. He was a state delegate at the Republican National Convention in July 2016 and appears with Eric Trump in a photo posted on his Facebook page. Neither the Trump Organization's spokeswoman nor its general counsel acknowledged requests to discuss the property. An email to Trump Jr. about the property was not returned. Berghold, an active Democrat and no fan of the president, said that after she confronted Ferraro on July 3, he apologized and said they would keep down the noise. She said when she confronted Ferraro about the shooting, he said that his \"partners have the Secret Service coming, and they shoot, too.\" A spokeswoman for the Secret Service said the agency had no comment. Ferraro would not discuss whether Secret Service agents shoot on the property. Ferraro obtained a license from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation granting the property the right to act as a noncommercial shooting preserve for invited guests and relatives only. The license is set to expire in April. Ferraro said he was the primary person in charge of the company that owns the land. He would not discuss how he knows the Trumps or their ownership of the property and would not discuss the use of exploding targets. He said there was no shooting range on the land and said no one has visited the tract without him being there. \"Who I bring and what I do on my private property, as long as it's within my legal rights, is not a story for anyone,\" he said. He called the Trumps \"private citizens just like anyone else.\" \"You're not asking me about other guests who are up there who are better known than the names you mention,\" he said, but declined to elaborate. \"Guns make noise. That's all I can tell you.\" No complaints about the property have been lodged with the Town of Dover, which governs the hamlet of Wingdale, said Donn Andersen, the town's building inspector. He said there was nothing in the town code governing the use of exploding targets, and the tower wouldn't require a permit since it's not occupied. The chapter of the town's code on noise makes no mention of guns, shooting or target practice. The Trumps have deep ties to Dutchess County, a red-leaning part of the state in the bucolic Hudson Valley that voted narrowly for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. The president's brother, Robert, lives in nearby Millbrook and the family business owns and operates the Trump National Golf Club Hudson Valley in Hopewell Junction. Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are avid hunters and fishermen, but their presence in the tightknit upstate community has become known only through the rumor mill. Ferraro, not the Trumps, introduced himself to neighbors when the property was acquired in 2013, though one neighbor met Trump Jr. after the election, neighbors said. Dougherty said he has seen a white Range Rover with Eric Trump's initials on the license plates drive to the property on days when there is loud shooting. Others said that since the presidential campaign, it was clear the Trumps were around because they were accompanied by Secret Service agents traveling in black SUVs. The property sits at the end of a dirt-packed road in Wingdale where a metal gate stops uninvited guests. Around the time of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, orange posters warning visitors that the area was patrolled by the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office began to appear, neighbors said. The previous owners of the land, which on one side abuts the old potter's field of an abandoned state psychiatric hospital said to be haunted, told the AP they knew they were selling to an anonymous buyer who wanted to hunt on the property but had no idea the Trumps were behind the purchase. During negotiations, said Joe Kleinman \u2014 who with his wife, Jocelyn, sold the property in August 2013 for $665,000 \u2014 the buyer's agent tried to reduce the price by invoking a 1991 state court decision that requires buyers disclose to sellers if a property is known to be haunted. Kleinman refused, saying anyone who truly believed it was haunted would either abandon the sale or pay a premium. \"That was the end of that conversation,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Delivering a blow to pets everywhere, election officials in Kansas have ruled that Angus, a dog, will not be able to run for governor.\u00a0 According to local CBS affiliate KWCH12-TV, the Kansas secretary of state's office found that Angus, a dog from Hutchinson, Kansas, is not capable of serving the duties required of the governor's office. Currently, there are no state rules or bylaws that dictate whether or not a dog can run for office. This technicality led Angus' family to formulate a bid for the governor's seat. \"Basically, I was reading some stories about the young teenagers that were entering the governor's race and I thought, 'I wonder what it takes to be in the race,' and I thought, 'I wonder if my dog, Angus could run,'\" Angus' owner and would-be campaign chair Terran Woolley told KWCH.\u00a0 Angus, 23 years in \"dog years,\" promised \"soft couches, Tempur-Pedic beds\" and a \"completely anti-squirrel agenda\" if elected, according to his Facebook page. With all the teenagers running for governor, i decided a 23 (in dog years)  candidate is more ready to assume the... Woolley plugged Angus' fitness for office: \"I do believe that he is a caring, nurturing individual who cares about the best for humanity and all creatures other than squirrels.\" While he would have been one of the more unconventional gubernatorial candidates, Angus is far from a trailblazer -- at least two other towns in the U.S. have elected pooches to political office. In Rabbit Hash, Kentucky, population of 315, a dog has been elected four times to be mayor of the small town north of Lexington. Most recently, according to local CBS affiliate WCCO, Brynneth Pawltro, a 3-year old pit bull, beat out a cat, a chicken and a donkey, among others, to become the town's mayor in June of last year.\u00a0 WCCO reports that Rabbit Hash has been electing animal mayors since the 1990s. Pawltro's assistants are Bourbon, an Australian Shepard, and Lady Stone, a border collie. Unlike the gubernatorial job that Angus was angling for, the role of mayor in Rabbit Hash is ceremonial only - there are no powers associated with the job. In August of 2016, a Minneapolis town elected 9-year old Duke, a Great Pyrenees to serve his third term as mayor of Cormorant (also an honorary gig).\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "The federal government has a suggestion for how to fix Amtrak's money-losing long-distance routes: stop giving them money. The White House budget, released Monday, proposes that \"States begin to share the operating subsidy costs of Long Distance routes with the Federal Government.\" It suggests cutting the federal subsidy for Amtrak in half, from $1.4 billion to $738 million. That would save the feds about $6.3 billion this decade, according to calculations from the Wharton School of Business. The only problem? Many states, already strapped for cash, are unlikely to come up with the needed funding. State and local governments already account for 77 percent of public infrastructure spending in the U.S., according to the Economic Policy Institute. And more than half of states have faced budget shortfalls during the last two years, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In addition, the political appetite for raising state or local taxes, low in the best of circumstances, is nearly nonexistent today. With tax reform that effectively made state and local taxes more expensive (by reducing their deductibility from federal taxes) and Congressional elections looming in November, the chances of any tax hikes approach zero. Amtrak, for which a proposed funding cut is not new, expressed concern in a statement. \"While we have not yet seen the details, we are concerned that any dramatic cuts could negatively impact the more than 31 million people who depend on Amtrak across the nation, in 46 states and more than 500 communities large and small,\" the company said. \"Amtrak is focused on running efficiently\u00a0 -- covering 94.7 percent of our total network operating costs through ticket sales and other revenues in FY17 -- but these services all currently rely on some level of Federal investment.\" So what would be the effects of defunding Amtrak? It would be \"devastating on Amtrak's long-distance routes, likely forcing the abandonment of many, if not all of them,\" said Rich Sampson, editor of RAIL Magazine, which is published by the Community Transportation Association of America. If just a few states drop funding for train service, it could throw an entire route into disarray, creating a \"patchwork\" of train lines that end at state borders. And flying in the face of the administration's promise to reduce regulatory complexity, it could well create a scenario where a single route would be governed by different statewide agreements: \"Ending Amtrak's national role would subject each route to separate agreements between each state and host railroads, potentially introducing varying levels of access and service across a given line,\" Sampson said. While Amtrak set records last year for ridership, revenue and earnings, it still lost $194 million. That's due mostly to long-distance routes, which are unprofitable, while busy lines like the Northeast Corridor are money-makers. Long-distance routes served only about 15 percent of Amtrak's riders last year, but they cover a lot of area, serving half the stations in the railroad's network. In half of the states where Amtrak operates, they are the only Amtrak routes, the company said. To witness the effects lack of money can have -- even in the presence of regulations -- riders need only look at positive train control technology. The safety gear, which Congress required all trains to install back in 2008, today exists\u00a0only on three train lines, even though trains keep crashing with alarming frequency.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Donald Trump is proposing a $4 trillion-plus budget for next year that projects a $1 trillion or so federal deficit and \u2014 unlike the plan he released last year \u2014 never comes close to promising a balanced federal ledger even after 10 years. And that's before last week's $300 billion budget pact is added this year and next, showering both the Pentagon and domestic agencies with big increases. The spending spree, along with last year's tax cuts, has the deficit moving sharply higher with Republicans in control of Washington. The original plan was for Trump's new budget to slash domestic agencies even further than last year's proposal, but instead it will land in Congress three days after he signed a two-year spending agreement that wholly rewrites both last year's budget and the one to be released Monday. The 2019 budget was originally designed to double down on last year's proposals to slash foreign aid, the Environmental Protection Agency, home heating assistance and other nondefense programs funded by Congress each year. \"A lot of presidents' budgets are ignored. But I would expect this one to be completely irrelevant and totally ignored,\" said Jason Furman, a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. \"In fact, Congress passed a law week that basically undid the budget before it was even submitted.\" In a preview of the 2019 budget, the White House on Sunday focused on Trump's $1.5 trillion plan for the nation's crumbling infrastructure. He also will ask for a $13 billion increase over two years for opioid prevention, treatment and long-term recovery. A request of $23 billion for border security, including $18 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and money for more detention beds for detained immigrants, is part of the budget, too. Trump would again spare Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare as he promised during the 2016 campaign. And while his plan would reprise last year's attempt to scuttle the \"Obamacare\" health law and sharply cut back the Medicaid program for the elderly, poor and disabled, Trump's allies on Capitol Hill have signaled there's no interest in tackling hot-button health issues during an election year. Instead, the new budget deal and last year's tax cuts herald the return of trillion dollar-plus deficits. Last year, Trump's budget predicted a $526 billion budget deficit for the 2019 fiscal year starting Oct. 1; instead, it's set to easily exceed $1 trillion once the cost of the new spending pact and the tax cuts are added to Congressional Budget Office projections. Mick Mulvaney, the former tea party congressman who runs the White House budget office, said Sunday that Trump's new budget, if implemented, would tame the deficit over time. \"The budget does bend the trajectory down, it does move us back towards balance. It does get us away from trillion-dollar deficits,\" Mulvaney said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Just because this deal was signed does not mean the future is written in stone. We do have a chance still to change the trajectory. And that is what the budget will show tomorrow,\" he said. Last year, Trump's budget projected a slight surplus after a decade, but critics said it relied on an enormous accounting gimmick \u2014 double counting a 10-year, $2 trillion surge in revenues from the economic benefits of \"tax reform.\" Now that tax reform has passed, the math trick can't be used, and the Trump plan doesn't come close to balancing. But critics are likely to say this year's Trump plan, which promises 3 percent growth, continuing low inflation, and low interest yields on U.S. Treasury bills despite a flood of new borrowing, underestimates the mounting cost of financing the government's $20 trillion-plus debt. The White House is putting focus this year on Trump's long-overdue plan to boost spending on the nation's crumbling infrastructure. The plan would put up $200 billion in federal money over the next 10 years to leverage $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending, relying on state and local governments and the private sector to contribute the bulk of the funding. Critics contend the infrastructure plan will fail to reach its goals without more federal support. Proposals to streamline the permitting process as a way to reduce the cost of projects have already generated opposition from environmental groups. Presidential budgets tend to reprise many of the same elements year after year. While details aren't out yet, Trump's budget is likely to curb crop insurance costs, cut student loan subsidies, reduce pension benefits for federal workers, and cut food stamps, among other proposals.",

            "article_content": "Investigators scoured the scene of one of Russia's worst-ever plane crashes Monday, after the passenger jet crashed Sunday near Moscow minutes after take-off, killing all 71 people on board. Both flight recorders were found among the wreckage, according to Russian news agency, TASS.\u00a0 The voice recorder was found in a \"satisfactory state,\" according to TASS, while earlier, the parametric recorder had also been located. Saratov Airlines, the operator of the flight, suspended its use of all AN-148 aircraft until the end of the investigation into the cause of the crash. On Monday, the crash site was enveloped in heavy snow that was waist-high in places, making it difficult to access, with emergency workers forced to reach the wreckage by foot and use snowmobiles. Russia's Investigative Committee said it would consider explanations for the crash including human error, technical failure and weather conditions, as the country has experienced record snowfall in recent weeks. It did not mention the possibility of terrorism. The Antonov AN-148 plane went down in the Ramensky district around 44 miles southeast of Moscow after taking off from Domodedovo airport in the Russian capital and disappearing off the radar at 2:28 pm local time on Sunday. \"Sixty-five passengers and six crew members were on board, and all of them died,\" Russia's office of transport investigations said in a statement. A Swiss citizen and a citizen of Azerbaijan were among the fatalities on a list released by the emergency services ministry. Three children also died including a five-year-old girl. The flight was operated by the domestic Saratov Airlines and was headed for Orsk, a city in the Ural mountains. Around one hundred investigators and criminologists were working at the scene, the Investigative Committee, which investigates major incidents, said Monday. The emergency services ministry said at least one of the two black boxes had been found.  With wreckage of the plane spread over more than 30 hectares around the crash site, it will take a week to inspect the whole area, the emergency services ministry said. More than 900 people using equipment including drones were involved in the search operation, which has been reclassified as looking for bodies rather than survivors, the ministry said. \"We plan to carry out the main stage of the search operation in seven days because the plane debris is scattered over a very large area,\" emergency services minister Vladimir Puchkov said at the scene, quoted by Interfax news agency, adding that \"heavy snow\" hampered searchers. \"We walked about 600 to 700 metres across a field, with snow in places waist-deep,\" said Alexei Besedin, one of the first rescuers to reach the scene, quoted by the emergency services ministry. \"I felt a shock wave,\" Maria, a resident of a village near the crash site, told AFP. \"The windows shook,\" she said The transport investigations office said the plane disappeared from radar screens several minutes after take-off. The Russian-made plane was reportedly seven years old and bought by Saratov Airlines from another Russian airline a year ago. Saratov Airlines was founded in the 1930s and flies to 35 Russian cities. Its hub is Saratov Central Airport in southern Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin offered \"his profound condolences to those who lost their relatives in the crash,\" his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin -- who is running for re-election in a March 18 poll -- cancelled plans to travel to the Black Sea resort of Sochi to meet with Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas. Instead, the meeting was to take place in Moscow. The governor of the Orenburg region, where the plane was heading, told media that \"more than 60 people\" on board the plane were from the region. The region declared Monday a day of mourning with flags lowered and entertainment events cancelled. With a population of 237,000 people, Orsk is the second biggest city in the Orenburg region, near Russia's border with Kazakhstan. Russia has suffered numerous plane crashes, with airlines often operating ageing aircraft in dangerous flying conditions. A light aircraft crashed in November in Russia's far east, killing six people on board. In December 2016, a military plane carrying Russia's famed Red Army Choir crashed after taking off from Sochi, killing all 92 people on board. The choir had been due to give a concert to Russian troops in Syria. Pilot error was blamed for that crash. In March 2016, all 62 passengers died when a FlyDubai jet crashed in bad weather during an aborted landing at Rostov-on-Don airport.",

            "article_content": "Analysts are starting to assess the potential impact of President Donald Trump's $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan as laid out in his State of the Union address, and as is often the case, the devil is in the details. The Trump administration, which is expected to release a fleshed-out proposal in coming weeks, is aiming to address what the president called the nation's \"crumbling\" infrastructure. The proposed investment can't come soon enough in the eyes of some, given a report this week that found more than 54,000 U.S. bridges are \"structurally deficient.\" The president's proposal involves just $200 billion in federal funds, with the balance coming from state and local governments as well as private investors. Financially strained cities and states may struggle to raise the funding to take advantage of the Trump administration's infrastructure plan, policy experts warn. Some analysts say Congress is unlikely to pass the infrastructure bill this year, pushing off the much-needed investment until 2019 or later.\u00a0 \"Few details were provided on how the infrastructure bill would be funded beyond calls for partnerships,\" Ed Mills, analyst at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a note.\u00a0 Shares of large publicly traded civil engineering and construction companies could see a boost ahead of the White House's more detailed plan, which is expected in mid-February, analysts at B. Riley wrote in a note to clients. Trump's call for reduced regulatory hurdles on new projects could prompt objections by Democrats if environmental protections are weakened, wrote Mills, who added he believes Congress isn't likely to pass a bill until next year.\u00a0 The November midterms could also shorten the window for action on infrastructure. As the B. Riley analysts put it: \"There is comparatively little time remaining in the legislative schedule to negotiate a bill before the 2018 elections become a distraction.\"\u00a0 Still, infrastructure spending is \"one of the few remaining areas where bipartisan progress is possible,\" they added.\u00a0 Stephanie Miller, an analyst at Heights Securities, gives Trump's proposal 15 percent odds of passage, but believes Trump may now be \"more emboldened\" to direct policy, giving traction to his push for a wall at the Mexican border and the infrastructure spending plan.\u00a0 She added, \"Despite the fact that Trump didn't outline any funding sources,\" it is possible infrastructure policy could become law in 2018.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Arizona Senator Jeff Flake gave a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday, delivering his message to President Trump that assaults on the media and freedom of speech have the potential to cause damage beyond America's borders. The speech comes on the same day that Mr. Trump says he will announce a set of \"Fake News Awards,\" addressing what he sees as bias in the mainstream media. The full transcript of Senator Flake's comments, as prepared for delivery, appear below. \u00a0 Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident...\" So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America. As the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \"Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\" During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan's proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history. It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last. 2017 was a year which saw the truth -- objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \"alternative facts\" into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \"The enemy of the people,\" was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017. Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \"enemy of the people,\" that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \"annihilating such individuals\" who disagreed with the supreme leader. This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president's party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward -- despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot's enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn't suit him \"fake news,\" it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press. I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \"fake news\" are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth.\u00a0 To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice. According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \"false news\" charges. Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president's time in office.\u00a0 Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful -- in fact, we question the powerful most ardently -- to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality. No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it. Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don't. No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions.\u00a0 And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism -- who must constantly deflect and distort and distract -- who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger. Now, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \"most corrupt and dishonest\" media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are. And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism. Together, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction. It is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial -- such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year's inaugural. But many untruths are not at all trivial -- such as the seminal untruth of the president's political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate -- to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all -- the supposed \"hoax\" at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. To be very clear, to call the Russia matter a \"hoax\" -- as the president has many times -- is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security.\u00a0 It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads. Ignoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth -- so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country. Mr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated. Mr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports. But a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story: \"In February\u2026Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, \"You can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.\" In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being \"demonized\" by \"fake news.\" Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote \"laughing by his side\" Duterte called reporters \"spies.\" In July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had \"spread lots of false versions, lots of lies\" about his country, adding, \"This is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?\" There are more: \"A state official in Myanmar recently said, \"There is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,\" referring to the persecuted ethnic group. \u00a0 Leaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised \"fake news\" legislation in the new year.\" And on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible. We are not in a \"fake news\" era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere. In our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster.\u00a0 As George Orwell warned, \"The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.\" Any of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press's obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people's right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it. What is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question: \"We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\" Mr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions. \u00a0We are a mature democracy -- it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring -- or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.\u00a0 \u00a0I sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: \"What is truth?\" His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled \"Oh Say, What is Truth.\" It ends as follows: \"Then say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first, For the limits of time it steps o'er. Tho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst. Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst, Eternal ... unchanged ... evermore.\" Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

            "article_content": "This piece originally aired Nov. 28, 2017. There's no mystery about what goes into Jack Daniel's whiskey. The popular drink has been around for 151 years and its recipe is on the company's website. But a story about how Jack Daniel began his distillery is only now gaining attention. Some of the first clues about the role of Nearest Green were in Daniel's official biography, published in 1967, more than half a century after his death. Green was mentioned about 50 times. Then his name seemed to disappear, until author Fawn Weaver helped uncover the truth at the heart of how Daniel came to make whiskey, reports CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller. \"It's important to set the record straight because anyone who accomplished something like Nearest did should be honored,\" Weaver said. What Nearest Green, a slave, did was teach Jack Daniel how to make whiskey.  \"It was on the cover of The New York Times international edition. It was possible that an African-American was behind Jack Daniel's. And it's never been spoken about until now?\" Weaver said.   For Weaver, finding proof of Green's legacy has become a passion bordering on obsession. Over the past year, Weaver has collected a library of documents, letters and pictures hoping to parse the truth from folklore.  \"Finally, one of the elders in the community says, 'Well, you know his name wasn't really Nearest.' Well, his name was Nathan and he's from Maryland,\" she said. \u00a0  After digging for over 2,500 hours and speaking to more than 100 relatives, it started to come together.  Debbie Staples \u2013 a great-granddaughter of Green's \u2013 had heard the tales of whiskey from her grandmother.   \"I knew she had no reason to make up a story like that,\" Staples said.  In the late 1850s, Jack Daniel, an orphan, started working for a wealthy landowner and whiskey distiller named Dan Call. Call teamed Daniel with Green, one of his slaves and his main whiskey man.  \"And then after slavery he started his own company and the person he went to first was his mentor, and he did not see race as a barrier,\" Weaver said.   Weaver soon found evidence in black and white. A1972 article in the Tennessee Historical Quarterly listed Nearest Green as Jack Daniel's first head distiller.   \"When we've known and understood the weight of this story, all I can offer is anything we can do to continue to honor the name of Nearest, we will do,\" said Mark McCallum, president of Jack Daniel's brands.  The company first acknowledged Green as Daniel's mentor last year. \"There was an enormous amount of blowback,\" McCallum said. \"It ranged from some very positive commentary on the story to some very vitriolic. It was a very tense time in America, as well. Then we were into that month or two leading up to the U.S. presidential elections, but I thought the last thing that America needed at that time was for Jack Daniel to come out again after all this commentary and raise up this story again.\"  \"People had been saying this for a very long time, but there was not one shred of proof. And so if you have a story that you know will be controversial because most people don't listen to the whole story,\" Weaver said.  She says people mistakenly assume, \"Jack Daniel had slaves.\" By all accounts, he did not.\u00a0 It is believed that Daniel opened his distillery in 1866, a year after the 13th Amendment abolished slavery. Working with Daniel helped to make Green and his children wealthier than many of their white neighbors.   Today, Green is mentioned in tours of the distillery. There is no known photograph of Nearest Green, but there is a picture of Green's son, George, sitting right next to Daniel in a group at a time when black employees were often relegated to the back. Three living Green descendants still work at the distillery, including his great-granddaughter Debbie Staples.  \"It means a lot to me to know that, now the world will know. Our country is divided, I know there is a lot of hate going. But, you know, to be in the South and to have a relationship with someone that's \u2013 you would think that would never happen,\" Staples said.   Despite the deep racial divides of the American South in the 19th century, an improbable friendship brewed \u2013 one at the heart of a quintessentially American brand.   \"For me, this project ends when I can go anywhere around the world and say 'Nearest Green' and people know who he is. I have never lived in this type of climate of race and when I look at this story, this is one story that's given me hope through everything else,\" Weaver said.  Weaver hopes to honor Green's legacy by building a memorial park, republishing Jack Daniel's biography, and creating a new whiskey called Uncle Nearest. Proceeds will go toward a scholarship fund for Green's living descendants and to support the Nearest Green Foundation's various efforts.",

            "article_content": "Nancy Pelosi is the chief villain of Republican campaign ads. The leader some Democrats promise to vote against. The subject of much speculation that her grip on power is coming to an end. Nevertheless, she says she's not going anywhere \u2014 and certainly not while President Trump is in the White House. \"This is not anything to make a big fuss over, it's politics,\" Pelosi said in a 35-minute phone interview with The Associated Press. \"I can take the heat and that's why I stay in the kitchen.\" Pushing back on those who say her leadership position is in jeopardy, Pelosi all but dared her doubters to envision any other House Democrat sitting across the table to negotiate with Mr. Trump. \"I have a following in the country that's unsurpassed by anybody, unless they're running for president,\" Pelosi said. Mr. Trump and the Republicans are eager to see her go, she said, \"and I'm just not going to let them do that.\" With Democrats bullish about winning back the House majority, Pelosi is already beginning to lay out a detailed early-days agenda that could be set in motion come January. Beyond cleaning up corruption, lowering health care costs and providing bigger paychecks, Pelosi told AP the Democrats would push forward legislation on background checks for gun purchases and legal status for young immigrants brought to this country illegally, often referred to as \"Dreamers.\" \"We're ready,\" she said. Yet Pelosi's return to the speakership, if Democrats triumph, is far from assured. Dozens of Democrats \u2014 candidates and a few lawmakers \u2014 are saying they may not back her, creating an unprecedented groundswell for new leadership. \"I think we're in different territory now,\" said Rep. Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who won about one-third of the Democrats during a private caucus vote when he mounted a symbolic challenge against Pelosi two years ago. \"It's time to turn the page.\" But Pelosi has faced uprisings from the ranks before, most notably after Democrats lost control of the House after the tea party Republican wave of 2010. Anyone who is counting her out \u2014 and many are trying to show her to the exits\u2014 may be underestimating her staying power. \"It's immodest of me to say, but I say to women now, 'Just go for it.' Tell them why you think you're the best person to do this job,\" she said. \"I want to be an example to them, just to say, 'Don't run away from a fight.' If you think you're the one that should be there, you make the fight.\" It's not that other Democrats haven't tried to replace her. Pelosi's top lieutenant, Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, has long coveted the top job, waiting out Pelosi for his moment to hold the gavel. He has been promoting himself to colleagues as a \"bridge\" to the next generation of leadership. Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn of South Carolina let it be known recently that he, too, is willing to take the helm if Pelosi falls short, lawmakers said. That prospect is appealing to many Democrats, as he would be the first African-American speaker. And younger lawmakers, including the 45-year-old Ryan, have not shut the door on running. Some say it's time for a clean sweep, and that replacing 78-year-old Pelosi with 79-year-old Hoyer or 78-year-old Clyburn is not the generational change that the Democratic caucus wants. \"A lot of new people have come in and said, 'Look, do I have to be here 30 years before I insert myself into the leadership group?' \" said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., who sees Clyburn's potential bid as particularly influential in putting votes from the Congressional Black Caucus in play. The chairman of the CBC, Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., is likely to support Clyburn if he runs for speaker. The complaints against Pelosi do not necessarily stem from her firm grip on the caucus \u2014 she is known for being direct with lawmakers, using what she has called her \"mother-of-five voice.\" But her long tenure has left little room for up-and-comers, and her visibility has become a liability for some Democrats. Republicans have poured millions into vilifying Pelosi in ads, some $13 million so far this election cycle, and the House GOP's campaign arm says Pelosi provides \"a top argument\" for electing more Republicans. As more and more Democratic candidates and lawmakers stare down campaign ads linking them to Pelosi, some are pledging to vote against her. When the cameras turn on them during the speaker vote once the new Congress convenes in January, it's hard to see how some of them will be able to belt out the name, \"Pelosi.\" Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., a vocal proponent for new leadership, envisions more of a changing of the guard than an insurrection. \"I didn't say you grab the torch out of their hands and kick them down the stairs,\" she said in an interview. The missing piece in the furious behind-the-scenes chatter over Pelosi's future is an obvious successor. Several leaders-in-waiting having moved on, and one lawmaker who had been seen as a possible replacement, Rep. Joe Crowley, recently lost his New York primary to newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Ocasio-Cortez hasn't said whom she will support this fall. \"There can't be a race when no one has declared their candidacy,\" said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who joined Pelosi for a \"Moms' Summit\" in her Houston district this month that drew 600 people. Some of them lined up for the chance to snap selfies with Pelosi. \"She was not an unhappy camper; she was a happy camper.\" Democrats are loath to start the new Congress in January with a floor fight over the speakership if they are newly in power. And many Democrats say that, with an unprecedented number of women are running for office, \"it would be very unceremonial to have the first woman speaker of the House win back the house \u2014 to lead us to victory \u2014 and then not to have her be speaker,\" said first-term Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. \"If we win the House, I think Nancy stays, but there'll be a transition at some point,\" the Silicon Valley congressman said. Pelosi acknowledges she will not lead House Democrats forever and that if she retakes the gavel it will be as part of a transition to a next generation of leadership. Two years ago she was prepared to retire if Hillary Clinton was in the White House. But once Mr. Trump won, she felt compelled to stay \u2014 \"a four-year extension,\" as she puts it \u2014 to protect the Affordable Care Act, banking reform and the party's other accomplishments. \"We think the fate of the nation is at stake,\" she said.Nancy Pelosi is the chief villain of Republican campaign ads. The leader some Democrats promise to vote against. The subject of much speculation that her grip on power is coming to an end. Nevertheless, she says she's not going anywhere \u2014 and certainly not while President Trump is in the White House. Pushing back on those who say her leadership position is in jeopardy, Pelosi all but dared her doubters to envision any other House Democrat sitting across the table to negotiate with Trump.

            "article_content": "MILAN -- A right-wing extremist suspected of shooting six Africans in central Italy was \"lucid and determined, aware of what he had done\" and exhibited no remorse, an Italian law enforcement official said Sunday. Luca Traini, 28, remained jailed as police investigated him on multiple counts of attempted murder with the aggravating circumstance of \"racial hatred\" for the Saturday attacks in the Italian city of Macerata. The five men and one woman wounded in the two-hour drive-by shooting spree are from Nigeria, Ghana, Gambia and Mali, according to RAI state television. Italian authorities said they seized Adolf Hitler's \"Mein Kampf,\" other publications linked to Nazism and a flag with a Celtic cross, a symbol commonly used by white supremacists, from Traini's home Sunday. The suspect was an unsuccessful candidate last year in a local election for the anti-migrant Northern League political party. Italy's ANSA news agency quoted acquaintances saying he previously had ties with the neo-fascist Forza Nuova and CasaPound parties. Photographs released by police showed Traini with a neo-Nazi tattoo prominently on his forehead and an Italian flag tied around his neck. Col. Michele Roberti, the Carabineri commander in Macerata, told Sky TG24 that Traini demonstrated no remorse for the two-hour rampage and \"it's likely that he carried out this crazy gesture as a sort of retaliation, a sort of vendetta\" for the gruesome slaying of a teenager a few days earlier. A Nigerian man has been arrested in the death of Pamela Mastropietro, 18. Her remains were found in two suitcases days after she walked away from a drug rehab community. Police said her bloody clothes, a receipt from a pharmacy where she bought a syringe, and knives consistent with the crime were found in the Nigerian suspect's apartment. Roberti ruled out any personal connection between Traini and the slain woman. The woman wounded in the shooting spree, a 29-year-old identified only as Jennifer, told La Stampa from her hospital bed that she no longer feels free to walk around the city \"with peace of mind.\" \"I never hurt anyone. I was talking and laughing with three other people\" when she was struck by the bullet, she told the Turin-based newspaper. One of the six victims was released Saturday. The remaining patients were all stable, with one in intensive care and Jennifer facing surgery on her shoulder, doctors said Sunday. Her boyfriend told La Repubblica they were waiting at a bus station when he saw a man pointing something at them from a black car. He realized then that it was a gun. \"I gave Jennifer a push to get her out of the way and threw myself down. And I heard a shot: Boom!\" said Ogie Igbinowania. Jennifer told the newspaper she arrived in Italy seven months ago and joined her boyfriend in Macerata. \"I have always been comfortable here. People are friendly. I don't know why that guy fired at us,\" she said. A Nigerian community leader in Macerata, Sammy Kunoun, said he heard the shots as he was going to meet with cultural mediators about organizing a sit-in to support Mastropietro's family. They called off the event after the shootings for fear of further racist attacks. \"Now, we are all victims in this story,\" said Kunoun, adding that the immigrant community has been well-integrated in Macerata. Foreigners are 9.2 percent of the city's 43,000 residents, according to official data. Anti-foreigner sentiment has become a key theme of a heated electoral campaign. Italy has struggled with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants in the last few years coming across the Mediterranean Sea in smugglers' boats. The general election is scheduled for March 4 and the head of the rebranded League party, Matteo Salvini, had capitalized on the teen's killing in campaign appearances even before the shooting Saturday. Salvini is pledging to deport 150,000 migrants in his first year in office if his party wins control of parliament - drawing sharp rebukes that he is using the migrant crisis to foment xenophobia for political gain. Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni warned in Rome after the attack that \"the state will be particularly severe against whoever thinks of feeding the spiral of violence.\"",
